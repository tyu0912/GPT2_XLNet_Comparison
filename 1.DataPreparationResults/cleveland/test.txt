To the Congress of the United States The existence of an alarming and extraordinary business situation , involving the welfare and prosperity of all our people , has constrained me to call together in extra session the people s representatives in Congress , to the end that through a wise and patriotic exercise of the legislative duty , with which they solely are charged , present evils may be mitigated and dangers threatening the future may be averted . Our unfortunate financial plight is not the result of untoward events nor of conditions related to our natural resources , nor is it traceable to any of the afflictions which frequently check national growth and prosperity . With plenteous crops , with abundant promise of remunerative production and manufacture , with unusual invitation to safe investment , and with satisfactory assurance to business enterprise , suddenly financial distrust and fear have sprung up on every side . Numerous moneyed institutions have suspended because abundant assets were not immediately available to meet the demands of frightened depositors . Surviving corporations and individuals are content to keep in hand the money they are usually anxious to loan , and those engaged in legitimate business are surprised to find that the securities they offer for loans , though heretofore satisfactory , are no longer accepted . Values supposed to be fixed are fast becoming conjectural , and loss and failure have invaded every branch of business . I believe these things are principally chargeable to Congressional legislation touching the purchase and coinage of silver by the General Government . This legislation is embodied in a statute passed on the 14th day of July , 1890 , which was the culmination of much agitation on the subject involved , and which may be considered a truce , after a long struggle , between the advocates of free silver coinage and those intending to be more conservative . Undoubtedly the monthly purchases by the Government of 4 , 500 , 000 ounces of silver , enforced under that statute , were regarded by those interested in silver production as a certain guaranty of its increase in price . The result , however , has been entirely different , for immediately following a spasmodic and slight rise the price of silver began to fall after the passage of the act , and has since reached the lowest point ever known . This disappointing result has led to renewed and persistent effort in the direction of free silver coinage . Meanwhile not only are the evil effects of the operation of the present law constantly accumulating , but the result to which its execution must inevitably lead is becoming palpable to all who give the least heed to financial subjects . This law provides that in payment for the 4 , 500 , 000 ounces of silver bullion which the Secretary of the Treasury is commanded to purchase monthly there shall be issued Treasury notes redeemable on demand in gold or silver coin , at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury , and that said notes may be reissued . It is , however , declared in the act to be the established policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be provided by law . This declaration so controls the action of the Secretary of the Treasury as to prevent his exercising the discretion nominally vested in him if by such action the parity between gold and silver may be disturbed . Manifestly a refusal by the Secretary to pay these Treasury notes in gold if demanded would necessarily result in their discredit and depreciation as obligations payable only in silver , and would destroy the parity between the two metals by establishing a discrimination in favor of gold . Up to the 15th day of July , 1893 , these notes had been issued in payment of silver bullion purchases to the amount of more than 147 , 000 , 000 . While all but a very small quantity of this bullion remains uncoined and without usefulness in the Treasury , many of the notes given in its purchase have been paid in gold . This is illustrated by the statement that between the 1st day of May , 1892 , and the 15th day of July , 1893 , the notes of this kind issued in payment for silver bullion amounted to a little more than 54 , 000 , 000 , and that during the same period about 49 , 000 , 000 were paid by the Treasury in gold for the redemption of such notes . The policy necessarily adopted of paying these notes in gold has not spared the gold reserve of 100 , 000 , 000 long ago set aside by the Government for the redemption of other notes , for this fund has already been subjected to the payment of new obligations amounting to about 150 , 000 , 000 on account of silver purchases , and has as a consequence for the first time since its creation been encroached upon . We have thus made the depletion of our gold easy and have tempted other and more appreciative nations to add it to their stock . That the opportunity we have offered has not been neglected is shown by the large amounts of gold which have been recently drawn from our Treasury and exported to increase the financial strength of foreign nations . The excess of exports of gold over its imports for the year ending June 30 , 1893 , amounted to more than 87 , 500 , 000 . Between the 1st day of July , 1890 , and the 15th day of July , 1893 , the gold coin and bullion in our Treasury decreased more than 132 , 000 , 000 , while during the same period the silver coin and bullion in the Treasury increased more than 147 , 000 , 000 . Unless Government bonds are to be constantly issued and sold to replenish our exhausted gold , only to be again exhausted , it is apparent that the operation of the silver purchase law now in force leads in the direction of the entire substitution of silver for the gold in the Government Treasury , and that this must be followed by the payment of all Government obligations in depreciated silver . At this stage gold and silver must part company and the Government must fail in its established policy to maintain the two metals on a parity with each other . Given over to the exclusive use of a currency greatly depreciated according to the standard of the commercial world , we could no longer claim a place among nations of the first class , nor could our Government claim a performance of its obligation , so far as such an obligation has been imposed upon it , to provide for the use of the people the best and safest money . If , as many of its friends claim , silver ought to occupy a larger place in our currency and the currency of the world through general international cooperation and agreement , it is obvious that the United States will not be in a position to gain a hearing in favor of such an arrangement so long as we are willing to continue our attempt to accomplish the result single handed . The knowledge in business circles among our own people that our Government can not make its fiat equivalent to intrinsic value nor keep inferior money on a parity with superior money by its own independent efforts has resulted in such a lack of confidence at home in the stability of currency values that capital refuses its aid to new enterprises , while millions are actually withdrawn from the channels of trade and commerce to become idle and unproductive in the hands of timid owners . Foreign investors , equally alert , not only decline to purchase American securities , but make haste to sacrifice those which they already have . It does not meet the situation to say that apprehension in regard to the future of our finances is groundless and that there is no reason for lack of confidence in the purposes or power of the Government in the premises . The very existence of this apprehension and lack of confidence , however caused , is a menace which ought not for a moment to be disregarded . Possibly , if the undertaking we have in hand were the maintenance of a specific known quantity of silver at a parity with gold , our ability to do so might be estimated and gauged , and perhaps , in view of our unparalleled growth and resources , might be favorably passed upon . But when our avowed endeavor is to maintain such parity in regard to an amount of silver increasing at the rate of 50 , 000 , 000 yearly , with no fixed termination to such increase , it can hardly be said that a problem is presented whose solution is free from doubt . The people of the United States are entitled to a sound and stable currency and to money recognized as such on every exchange and in every market of the world . Their Government has no right to injure them by financial experiments opposed to the policy and practice of other civilized states , nor is it justified in permitting an exaggerated and unreasonable reliance on our national strength and ability to jeopardize the soundness of the people s money . This matter rises above the plane of party politics . It vitally concerns every business and calling and enters every household in the land . There is one important aspect of the subject which especially should never be overlooked . At times like the present , when the evils of unsound finance threaten us , the speculator may anticipate a harvest gathered from the misfortune of others , the capitalist may protect himself by hoarding or may even find profit in the fluctuations of values but the wage earner the first to be injured by a depreciated currency and the last to receive the benefit of its correction is practically defenseless . He relies for work upon the ventures of confident and contented capital . This failing him , his condition is without alleviation , for he can neither prey on the misfortunes of others nor hoard his labor . One of the greatest statesmen our country has known , speaking more than fifty years ago , when a derangement of the currency had caused commercial distress , said The very man of all others who has the deepest interest in a sound currency and who suffers most by mischievous legislation in money matters is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil . These words are as pertinent now as on the day they were uttered , and ought to impressively remind us that a failure in the discharge of our duty at this time must especially injure those of our countrymen who labor , and who because of their number and condition are entitled to the most watchful care of their Government . It is of the utmost importance that such relief as Congress can afford in the existing situation be afforded at once . The maxim He gives twice who gives quickly is directly applicable . It may be true that the embarrassments from which the business of the country is suffering arise as much from evils apprehended as from those actually existing . We may hope , too , that calm counsels will prevail , and that neither the capitalists nor the wage earners will give way to unreasoning panic and sacrifice their property or their interests under the influence of exaggerated fears . Nevertheless , every day s delay in removing one of the plain and principal causes of the present state of things enlarges the mischief already done and increases the responsibility of the Government for its existence . Whatever else the people have a right to expect from Congress , they may certainly demand that legislation condemned by the ordeal of three years disastrous experience shall be removed from the statute books as soon as their representatives can legitimately deal with it . It was my purpose to summon Congress in special session early in the coming September , that we might enter promptly upon the work of tariff reform , which the true interests of the country clearly demand , which so large a majority of the people , as shown by their suffrages , desire and expect , and to the accomplishment of which every effort of the present Administration is pledged . But while tariff reform has lost nothing of its immediate and permanent importance and must in the near future engage the attention of Congress , it has seemed to me that the financial condition of the country should at once and before all other subjects be considered by your honorable body . I earnestly recommend the prompt repeal of the provisions of the act passed July 14 , 1890 , authorizing the purchase of silver bullion , and that other legislative action may put beyond all doubt or mistake the intention and the ability of the Government to fulfill its pecuniary obligations in money universally recognized by all civilized countries .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Whereas by a proclamation dated the 12th day of June , 1895 , attention was called to the serious civil disturbances , accompanied by armed resistance to the established Government of Spain , then prevailing in the island of Cuba , and citizens of the United States and all other persons were admonished to abstain from taking part in such disturbances in contravention of the neutrality laws of the United States and Whereas said civil disturbances and armed resistance to the authority of Spain , a power with which the United States are on terms of peace and amity , continue to prevail in said island of Cuba and Whereas since the date of said proclamation said neutrality laws of the United States have been the subject of authoritative exposition by the judicial tribunal of last resort , and it has thus been declared that any combination of persons organized in the United States for the purpose of proceeding to and making war upon a foreign country with which the United States are at peace , and provided with arms to be used for such purpose , constitutes a military expedition or enterprise within the meaning of said neutrality laws , and that the providing or preparing of the means for such military expedition or enterprise , which is expressly prohibited by said laws , includes furnishing or aiding in transportation for such military expedition or enterprise and Whereas , by express enactment , if two or more persons conspire to commit an offense against the United States any act of one conspirator to effect the object of such conspiracy renders all the conspirators liable to fine and imprisonment and Whereas there is reason to believe that citizens of the United States and others within their jurisdiction fail to apprehend the meaning and operation of the neutrality laws of the United States as authoritatively interpreted as aforesaid , and may be misled into participation in transactions which are violations of said laws and will render them liable to the severe penalties provided for such violations Now , therefore , that the laws above referred to , as judicially construed , may be duly executed , that the international obligations of the United States may be fully satisfied , and that their citizens and all others within their jurisdiction , being seasonably apprised of their legal duty in the premises , may abstain from disobedience to the laws of the United States and thereby escape the forfeitures and penalties legally consequent thereon , Grover Cleveland , President of the United States , do hereby solemnly warn all citizens of the United States and all others within their jurisdiction against violations of the said laws , interpreted as hereinbefore explained , and give notice that all such violations will be vigorously prosecuted and I do hereby invoke the cooperation of all good citizens in the enforcement of said laws and in the detection and apprehension of any offenders against the same , and do hereby enjoin upon all the executive officers of the United States the utmost diligence in preventing , prosecuting , and punishing any infractions thereof .

Done at the city of Washington , this 27th day of July , 1896 , and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty first . GROVER CLEVELAND . By the President RICHARD OLNEY , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives I return without my approval House bill No . 1471 , entitled An act increasing the pension of Andrew Hill . This bill doubles the pension which the person named therein has been receiving for a number of years . It appears from the report of the committee to which the bill was referred that a claim made by him for increased pension has been lately rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground that the claimant is now receiving a pension commensurate with the degree of disability found to exist . The policy of frequently reversing by special enactment the decisions of the Bureau invested by law with the examination of pension claims , fully equipped for such examination , and which ought not to be suspected of any lack of liberality to our veteran soldiers , is exceedingly questionable . It may well be doubted if a committee of Congress has a better opportunity than such an agency to judge of the merits of these claims . If , however , there is any lack of power in the Pension Bureau for a full investigation , it should be supplied if the system adopted is inadequate to do full justice to claimants , it should be corrected , and if there is a want of sympathy and consideration for the defenders of our Government the Bureau should be reorganized . The disposition to concede the most generous treatment to the disabled , aged , and needy among our veterans ought not to be restrained and it must be admitted that in some cases justice and equity can not be done nor the charitable tendencies of the Government in favor of worthy objects of its care indulged under fixed rules . These conditions sometimes justify a resort to special legislation , but I am convinced that the interposition by special enactment in the granting of pensions should be rare and exceptional . In the nature of things if this is lightly done and upon slight occasion , an invitation is offered for the presentation of claims to Congress which upon their merits could not survive the test of an examination by the Pension Bureau , and whose only hope of success depends upon sympathy , often misdirected , instead of right and justice . The instrumentality organized by law for the determination of pension , claims is thus often overruled and discredited , and there is danger that in the end popular prejudice will be created against those who are worthily entitled to the bounty of the Government . There has lately been presented to me , on the same day , for approval , nearly 240 special bills granting and increasing pensions and restoring to the pension list the names of parties which for cause have been dropped . To aid Executive duty they were referred to the Pension Bureau for examination and report . After a delay absolutely necessary they have been returned to me within a few hours of the limit constitutionally permitted for Executive action . Two hundred and thirty two of these bills are thus classified Eighty one cover cases in which favorable action by the Pension Bureau was denied by reason of the insufficiency of the testimony filed to prove the facts alleged . These bills I have approved on the assumption that the claims were meritorious and that by the passage of the bills the Government has waived full proof of the facts . Twenty six of the bills cover claims rejected by the Pension Bureau because the evidence produced tended to prove that the alleged disability existed before the claimant s enlistment 21 cover claims which have been denied by such Bureau because the evidence tended to show that the disability , though contracted in the service , was not incurred in the line of duty 33 cover claims which have been denied because the evidence tended to establish that the disability originated after the soldier s discharge from the Army 47 cover claims which have been denied because the general pension laws contain no provisions under which they could be allowed , and 24 of the claims have never been presented to the Pension Bureau . I estimate the expenditure involved in these bills at more than 35 , 000 annually . Though my conception of public duty leads me to the conclusion , upon the slight examination which I have been able to give such of these bills as are not comprised in the first class above mentioned , that many of them should be disapproved , I am utterly unable to submit within the time allowed me for that purpose my objections to the same . They will therefore become operative without my approval . A sufficient reason for the return of the particular bill now under consideration is found in the fact that it provides that the name of Andrew Hill be placed upon the pension roll , while the records of the Pension Bureau , as well as a medical certificate made a part of the committee s report , disclose that the correct name of the intended beneficiary is Alfred Hill .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives In my last annual message I commended to the serious consideration of the Congress the condition of our national finances , and in connection with the subject indorsed a plan of currency legislation which at that time seemed to furnish protection against impending danger . This plan has not been approved by the Congress . In the meantime the situation has so changed and the emergency now appears so threatening that I deem it my duty to ask at the hands of the legislative branch of the Government such prompt and effective action as will restore confidence in our financial soundness and avert business disaster and universal distress among our people . Whatever may be the merits of the plan outlined in my annual message as a remedy for ills then existing and as a safeguard against the depletion of the gold reserve then in the Treasury , I am now convinced that its reception by the Congress and our present advanced stage of financial perplexity necessitate additional or different legislation . With natural resources unlimited in variety and productive strength and with a people whose activity and enterprise seek only a fair opportunity to achieve national success and greatness , our progress should not be checked by a false financial policy and a heedless disregard of sound monetary laws , nor should the timidity and fear which they engender stand in the way of our prosperity . It is hardly disputed that this predicament confronts us to day . Therefore no one in any degree responsible for the making and execution of our laws should fail to see a patriotic duty in honestly and sincerely attempting to relieve the situation . Manifestly this effort will not succeed unless it is made untrammeled by the prejudice of partisanship and with a steadfast determination to resist the temptation to accomplish party advantage . We may well remember that if we are threatened with financial difficulties all our people in every station of life are concerned and surely those who suffer will not receive the promotion of party interests as an excuse for permitting our present troubles to advance to a disastrous conclusion . It is also of the utmost importance that we approach the study of the problems presented as free as possible from the tyranny of preconceived opinions , to the end that in a common danger we may be able to seek with unclouded vision a safe and reasonable protection . The real trouble which confronts us consists in a lack of confidence , widespread and constantly increasing , in the continuing ability or disposition of the Government to pay its obligations in gold . This lack of confidence grows to some extent out of the palpable and apparent embarrassment attending the efforts of the Government under existing laws to procure gold and to a greater extent out of the impossibility of either keeping it in the Treasury or canceling obligations by its expenditure after it is obtained . The only way left open to the Government for procuring gold is by the issue and sale of its bonds . The only bonds that can be so issued were authorized nearly twenty five years ago and are not well calculated to meet our present needs . Among other disadvantages , they are made payable in coin instead of specifically in gold , which in existing conditions detracts largely and in an increasing ratio from their desirability as investments . It is by no means certain that bonds of this description can much longer be disposed of at a price creditable to the financial character of our Government . The most dangerous and irritating feature of the situation , however , remains to be mentioned . It is found in the means by which the Treasury is despoiled of the gold thus obtained without canceling a single Government obligation and solely for the benefit of those who find profit in shipping it abroad or whose fears induce them to hoard it at home . We have outstanding about five hundred millions of currency notes of the Government for which gold may be demanded , and , curiously enough , the law requires that when presented and , in fact , redeemed and paid in gold they shall be reissued . Thus the same notes may do duty many times in drawing gold from the Treasury nor can the process be arrested as long as private parties , for profit or otherwise , see an advantage in repeating the operation . More than 300 , 000 , 000 in these notes have already been redeemed in gold , and notwithstanding such redemption they are all still outstanding . Since the 17th day of January , 1894 , our bonded interest bearing debt has been increased 100 , 000 , 000 for the purpose of obtaining gold to replenish our coin reserve . Two issues were made amounting to fifty millions each , one in January and the other in November . As a result of the first issue there was realized something more than 58 , 000 , 000 in gold . Between that issue and the succeeding one in November , comprising a period of about ten months , nearly 103 , 000 , 000 in gold were drawn from the Treasury . This made the second issue necessary , and upon that more than fifty eight millions in gold was again realized . Between the date of this second issue and the present time , covering a period of only about two months , more than 69 , 000 , 000 in gold have been drawn from the Treasury . These large sums of gold were expended without any cancellation of Government obligations or in any permanent way benefiting our people or improving our pecuniary situation . The financial events of the past year suggest facts and conditions which should certainly arrest attention . More than 172 , 000 , 000 in gold have been drawn out of the Treasury during the year for the purpose of shipment abroad or hoarding at home . While nearly 103 , 000 , 000 of this amount was drawn out during the first ten months of the year , a sum aggregating more than two thirds of that amount , being about 69 , 000 , 000 , was drawn out during the following two months , thus indicating a marked acceleration of the depleting process with the lapse of time . The obligations upon which this gold has been drawn from the Treasury are still outstanding and are available for use in repeating the exhausting operation with shorter intervals as our perplexities accumulate . Conditions are certainly supervening tending to make the bonds which may be issued to replenish our gold less useful for that purpose . An adequate gold reserve is in all circumstances absolutely essential to the upholding of our public credit and to the maintenance of our high national character . Our gold reserve has again reached such a stage of diminution as to require its speedy reenforcement . The aggravations that must inevitably follow present conditions and methods will certainly lead to misfortune and loss , not only to our national credit and prosperity and to financial enterprise , but to those of our people who seek employment as a means of livelihood and to those whose only capital is their daily labor . It will hardly do to say that a simple increase of revenue will cure our troubles . The apprehension now existing and constantly increasing as to our financial ability does not rest upon a calculation of our revenue . The time has passed when the eyes of investors abroad and our people at home were fixed upon the revenues of the Government . Changed conditions have attracted their attention to the gold of the Government . There need be no fear that we can not pay our current expenses with such money as we have . There is now in the Treasury a comfortable surplus of more than 63 , 000 , 000 , but it is not in gold , and therefore does not meet our difficulty . I can not see that differences of opinion concerning the extent to which silver ought to be coined or used in our currency should interfere with the counsels of those whose duty it is to rectify evils now apparent in our financial situation . They have to consider the question of national credit and the consequences that will follow from its collapse . Whatever ideas may be insisted upon as to silver or bimetallism , a proper solution of the question now pressing upon us only requires a recognition of gold as well as silver and a concession of its importance , rightfully or wrongfully acquired , as a basis of national credit , a necessity in the honorable discharge of our obligations payable in gold , and a badge of solvency . I do not understand that the real fiends of silver desire a condition that might follow inaction or neglect to appreciate the meaning of the present exigency if it should result in the entire banishment of gold from our financial and currency arrangements . Besides the Treasury notes , which certainly should be paid in gold , amounting to nearly 500 , 000 , 000 , there will fall due in 1904 one hundred millions of bonds issued during the last year , for which we have received gold , and in 1907 nearly six hundred millions of 4 per cent bonds issued in 1877 . Shall the payment of these obligations in gold be repudiated If they are to be paid in such a manner as the preservation of our national honor and national solvency demands , we should not destroy or even imperil our ability to supply ourselves with gold for that purpose . While I am not unfriendly to silver and while I desire to see it recognized to such an extent as is consistent with financial safety and the preservation of national honor and credit , I am not willing to see gold entirely banished from our currency and finances . To avert such a consequence I believe thorough and radical remedial legislation should be promptly passed . I therefore beg the Congress to give the subject immediate attention . In my opinion the Secretary of the Treasury should be authorized to issue bonds of the Government for the purpose of procuring and maintaining a sufficient gold reserve and the redemption and cancellation of the United States legal tender notes and the Treasury notes issued for the purchase of silver under the law of July 14 , 1890 . We should be relieved from the humiliating process of issuing bonds to procure gold to be immediately and repeatedly drawn out on these obligations for purposes not related to the benefit of our Government or our people . The principal and interest of these bonds should be payable on their face in gold , because they should be sold only for gold or its representative , and because there would now probably be difficulty in favorably disposing of bonds not containing this stipulation . I suggest that the bonds be issued in denominations of twenty and fifty dollars and their multiples and that they bear interest at a rate not exceeding 3 per cent per annum . I do not see why they should not be payable fifty years from their date . We of the present generation have large amounts to pay if we meet our obligations , and long bonds are most salable . The Secretary of the Treasury might well be permitted at his discretion to receive on the sale of bonds the legal tender and Treasury notes to be retired , and of course when they are thus retired or redeemed in gold they should be canceled . These bonds under existing laws could be deposited by national banks as security for circulation , and such banks should be allowed to issue circulation up to the face value of these or any other bonds so deposited , except bonds outstanding bearing only 2 per cent interest and which sell in the market at less than par . National banks should not be allowed to take out circulating notes of a less denomination than 10 , and when such as are now outstanding reach the Treasury , except for redemption and retirement , they should be canceled and notes of the denomination of 10 and upward issued in their stead . Silver certificates of the denomination of 10 and upward should be replaced by certificates of the denominations under 10 . As a constant means for the maintenance of a reasonable supply of gold in the Treasury , our duties on imports should be paid in gold , allowing all other dues to the Government to be paid in any other form of money . I believe all the provisions I have suggested should be embodied in our laws if we are to enjoy a complete reinstatement of a sound financial condition . They need not interfere with any currency scheme providing for the increase of the circulating medium through the agency of national or State banks that may commend itself to the Congress , since they can easily be adjusted to such a scheme . Objection has been made to the issuance of interest bearing obligations for the purpose of retiring the noninterest bearing legal tender notes . In point of fact , however , these notes have burdened us with a large load of interest , and it is still accumulating . The aggregate interest on the original issue of bonds , the proceeds of which in gold constituted the reserve for the payment of these notes , amounted to 70 , 326 , 250 on January 1 , 1895 , and the annual charge for interest on these bonds and those issued for the same purpose during the last year will be 9 , 145 , 000 , dating from January 1 , 1895 . While the cancellation of these notes would not relieve us from the obligations already incurred on their account , these figures are given by way of suggesting that their existence has not been free from interest charges and that the longer they are outstanding , judging from the experience of the last year , the more expensive they will become . In conclusion I desire to frankly confess my reluctance to issuing more bonds in present circumstances and with no better results than have lately followed that course . I can not , however , refrain from adding to an assurance of my anxiety to cooperate with the present Congress in any reasonable measure of relief an expression of my determination to leave nothing undone which furnishes a hope for improving the situation or checking a suspicion of our disinclination or disability to meet with the strictest honor every national obligation .<speech_sep>REVISED CIVIL SERVICE RULES .

I am so deeply impressed with the importance of immediately and thoughtfully meeting the problem which recent events and a present condition have thrust upon us , involving the settlement of disputes arising between our laboring men and their employers , that I am constrained to recommend to Congress legislation upon this serious and pressing subject . Under our form of government the value of labor as an element of national prosperity should be distinctly recognized , and the welfare of the laboring man should be regarded as especially entitled to legislative care . In a country which offers to all its citizens the highest attainment of social and political distinction its workingmen can not justly or safely be considered as irrevocably consigned to the limits of a class and entitled to no attention and allowed no protest against neglect . The laboring man , bearing in his hand an indispensable contribution to our growth and progress , may well insist , with manly courage and as a right , upon the same recognition from those who make our laws as is accorded to any other citizen having a valuable interest in charge and his reasonable demands should be met in such a spirit of appreciation and fairness as to induce a contented and patriotic cooperation in the achievement of a grand national destiny . While the real interests of labor are not promoted by a resort to threats and violent manifestations , and while those who , under the pretext of an advocacy of the claims of labor , wantonly attack the rights of capital and for selfish purposes or the love of disorder sow seeds of violence and discontent should neither be encouraged nor conciliated , all legislation on the subject should be calmly and deliberately undertaken , with no purpose of satisfying unreasonable demands or gaining partisan advantage . The present condition of the relations between labor and capital is far from satisfactory . The discontent of the employed is due in a large degree to the grasping and heedless exactions of employers and the alleged discrimination in favor of capital as an object of governmental attention . It must also be conceded that the laboring men are not always careful to avoid causeless and unjustifiable disturbance . Though the importance of a better accord between these interests is apparent , it must be borne in mind that any effort in that direction by the Federal Government must be greatly limited by constitutional restrictions . There are many grievances which legislation by Congress can not redress , and many conditions which can not by such means be reformed . I am satisfied , however , that something may be done under Federal authority to prevent the disturbances which so often arise from disputes between employers and the employed , and which at times seriously threaten the business interests of the country and , in my opinion , the proper theory upon which to proceed is that of voluntary arbitration as the means of settling these difficulties . But I suggest that instead of arbitrators chosen in the heat of conflicting claims , and after each dispute shall arise , for the purpose of determining the same , there be created a commission of labor , consisting of three members , who shall be regular officers of the Government , charged among other duties with the consideration and settlement , when possible , of all controversies between labor and capital . A commission thus organized would have the advantage of being a stable body , and its members , as they gained experience , would constantly improve in their ability to deal intelligently and usefully with the questions which might be submitted to them . If arbitrators are chosen for temporary service as each case of dispute arises , experience and familiarity with much that is involved in the question will be lacking , extreme partisanship and bias will be the qualifications sought on either side , and frequent complaints of unfairness and partiality will be inevitable . The imposition upon a Federal court of a duty so foreign to the judicial function as the selection of an arbitrator in such cases is at least of doubtful propriety . The establishment by Federal authority of such a bureau would be a just and sensible recognition of the value of labor and of its right to be represented in the departments of the Government . So far as its conciliatory offices shall have relation to disturbances which interfere with transit and commerce between the States , its existence would be justified under the provision of the Constitution which gives to Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and in the frequent disputes between the laboring men and their employers , of less extent , and the consequences of which are confined within State limits and threaten domestic violence , the interposition of such a commission might be tendered , upon the application of the legislature or executive of a State , under the constitutional provision which requires the General Government to protect each of the States against domestic violence . If such a commission were fairly organized , the risk of a loss of popular support and sympathy resulting from a refusal to submit to so peaceful an instrumentality would constrain both parties to such disputes to invoke its interference and abide by its decisions . There would also be good reason to hope that the very existence of such an agency would invite application to it for advice and counsel , frequently resulting in the avoidance of contention and misunderstanding . If the usefulness of such a commission is doubted because it might lack power to enforce its decisions , much encouragement is derived from the conceded good that has been accomplished by the railroad commissions which have been organized in many of the States , which , having little more than advisory power , have exerted a most salutary influence in the settlement of disputes between conflicting interests . In July , 1884 , by a law of Congress , a Bureau of Labor was established and placed in charge of a Commissioner of Labor , who is required to collect information upon the subject of labor , its relations to capital , the hours of labor and the earnings of laboring men and women , and the means of promoting their material , social , intellectual , and moral prosperity . The commission which I suggest could easily be ingrafted upon the bureau thus already organized by the addition of two more commissioners and by supplementing the duties now imposed upon it by such other powers and functions as would permit the commissioners to act as arbitrators when necessary between labor and capital , under such limitations and upon such occasions as should be deemed proper and useful . Power should also be distinctly conferred upon this bureau to investigate the causes of all disputes as they occur , whether submitted for arbitration or not , so that information may always be at hand to aid legislation on the subject when necessary and desirable .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives It is made the constitutional duty of the President to recommend to the consideration of Congress from time to time such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . In no matters can the necessity of this be more evident than when the good faith of the United States under the solemn obligation of treaties with foreign powers is concerned . The question of the treatment of the subjects of China sojourning within the jurisdiction of the United States presents such a matter for the urgent and earnest consideration of the Executive and the Congress . In my first annual message , upon the assembling of the present Congress , I adverted to this question in the following words The harmony of our relations with China is fully sustained . In the application of the acts lately passed to execute the treaty of 1880 , restrictive of the immigration of Chinese laborers into the United States , individual cases of hardship have occurred beyond the power of the Executive to remedy , and calling for judicial determination . The condition of the Chinese question in the Western States and Territories is , despite this restrictive legislation , far from being satisfactory . The recent outbreak in Wyoming Territory , where numbers of unoffending Chinamen , indisputably within the protection of the treaties and the law , were murdered by a mob , and the still more recent threatened outbreak of the same character in Washington Territory , are fresh in the minds of all , and there is apprehension lest the bitterness of feeling against the Mongolian race on the Pacific Slope may find vent in similar lawless demonstrations . All the power of this Government should be exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of these men , and the inflexible sternness of the law in bringing the wrongdoers to justice should be insisted upon . Every effort has been made by this Government to prevent these violent outbreaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation of these outrages and it is but just to say that they are traceable to the lawlessness of men not citizens of the United States engaged in competition with Chinese laborers . Race prejudice is the chief factor in originating these disturbances , and it exists in a large part of our domain , jeopardizing our domestic peace and the good relationship we strive to maintain with China . The admitted right of a government to prevent the influx of elements hostile to its internal peace and security may not be questioned , even where there is no treaty stipulation on the subject . That the exclusion of Chinese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions prevail is strongly evidenced in the Dominion of Canada , where Chinese immigration is now regulated by laws more exclusive than our own . If existing laws are inadequate to compass the end in view , I shall be prepared to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measures , within the treaty limits , which the wisdom of Congress may devise . At the time I wrote this the shocking occurrences at Rock Springs , in Wyoming Territory , were fresh in the minds of all , and had been recently presented anew to the attention of this Government by the Chinese minister in a note which , while not unnaturally exhibiting some misconception of our Federal system of administration in the Territories while they as yet are not in the exercise of the full measure of that sovereign self government pertaining to the States of the Union , presents in truthful terms the main features of the cruel outrage there perpetrated upon inoffensive subjects of China . In the investigation of the Rock Springs outbreak and the ascertainment of the facts on which the Chinese minister s statements rest the Chinese representatives were aided by the agents of the United States , and the reports submitted , having been thus framed and recounting the facts within the knowledge of witnesses on both sides , possess an impartial truthfulness which could not fail to give them great impressiveness . The facts , which so far are not controverted or affected by any exculpatory or mitigating testimony , show the murder of a number of Chinese subjects in September last at Rock Springs , the wounding of many others , and the spoliation of the property of all when the unhappy survivors had been driven from their habitations . There is no allegation that the victims by any lawless or disorderly act on their part contributed to bring about a collision on the contrary , it appears that the law abiding disposition of these people , who were sojourners in our midst under the sanction of hospitality and express treaty obligations , was made the pretext for an attack upon them . This outrage upon law and treaty engagements was committed by a lawless mob . None of the aggressors happily for the national good fame appear by the reports to have been citizens of the United States . They were aliens engaged in that remote district as mining laborers , who became excited against the Chinese laborers , as it would seem , because of their refusal to join them in a strike to secure higher wages . The oppression of Chinese subjects by their rivals in the competition for labor does not differ in violence and illegality from that applied to other classes of native or alien labor . All are equally under the protection of law and equally entitled to enjoy the benefits of assured public order . Were there no treaty in existence referring to the rights of Chinese subjects did they come hither as all other strangers who voluntarily resort to this land of freedom , of self government , and of laws , here peaceably to win their bread and to live their lives , there can be no question that they would be entitled still to the same measure of protection from violence and the same free forum for the redress of their grievances as any other aliens . So far as the treaties between the United States and China stipulate for the treatment of the Chinese subjects actually in the United States as the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation are treated , they create no new status for them they simply recognize and confirm a general and existing rule , applicable to all aliens alike , for none are favored above others by domestic law , and none by foreign treaties unless it be the Chinese themselves in some respects . For by the third article of the treaty of November 17 , 1880 , between the United States and China it is provided that ARIIIf Chinese laborers , or Chinese of any other class , now either permanently or temporarily residing in the territory of the United States , meet with ill treatment at the hands of any other persons , the Government of the United States will exert all its power to devise measures for their protection and to secure to them the same rights , privileges , immunities , and exemptions as may be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation , and to which they are entitled by treaty . This article may be held to constitute a special privilege for Chinese subjects in the United States , as compared with other aliens not that it creates any peculiar rights which others do not share , but because , in case of ill treatment of the Chinese in the United States , this Government is bound to exert all its power to devise measures for their protection , by securing to them the rights to which equally with any and all other foreigners they are entitled . Whether it is now incumbent upon the United States to amend their general laws or devise new measures in this regard I do not consider in the present communication , but confine myself to the particular point raised by the outrage and massacre at Rock Springs . The note of the Chinese minister and the documents which accompany it give , as I believe , an unexaggerated statement of the lamentable incident , and present impressively the regrettable circumstance that the proceedings , in the name of justice , for the ascertainment of the crime and fixing the responsibility therefor were a ghastly mockery of justice . So long as the Chinese minister , under his instructions , makes this the basis of an appeal to the principles and convictions of mankind , no exception can be taken but when he goes further , and , taking as his precedent the action of the Chinese Government in past instances where the lives of American citizens and their property in China have been endangered , argues a reciprocal obligation on the part of the United States to indemnify the Chinese subjects who suffered at Rock Springs , it became necessary to meet his argument and to deny most emphatically the conclusions he seeks to draw as to the existence of such a liability and the right of the Chinese Government to insist upon it . I draw the attention of the Congress to the latter part of the note of the Secretary of State of February 18 , 1886 , in reply to the Chinese minister s representations , and invite special consideration of the cogent reasons by which he reaches the conclusion that whilst the United States Government is under no obligation , whether by the express terms of its treaties with China or the principles of international law , to indenmify these Chinese subjects for losses caused by such means and under the admitted circumstances , yet that in view of the palpable and discreditable failure of the authorities of Wyoming Territory to bring to justice the guilty parties or to assure to the sufferers an impartial forum in which to seek and obtain compensation for the losses which those subjects have incurred by lack of police protection , and considering further the entire absence of provocation or contribution on the part of the victims , the Executive may be induced to bring the matter to the benevolent consideration of the Congress , in order that that body , in its high discretion , may direct the bounty of the Government in aid of innocent and peaceful strangers whose maltreatment has brought discredit upon the country , with the distinct understanding that such action is in no wise to be held as a precedent , is wholly gratuitous , and is resorted to in a spirit of pure generosity toward those who are otherwise helpless . The correspondence exchanged is herewith submitted for the information of the Congress , and accompanies a like message to the House of Representatives .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives I herewith return without my approval House bill No . 10457 , entitled An act for the relief of dependent parents and honorably discharged soldiers and sailors who are now disabled and dependent upon their own labor for support . This is the first general bill that has been sanctioned by the Congress since the close of the late civil war permitting a pension to the soldiers and sailors who served in that war upon the ground of service and present disability alone , and in the entire absence of any injuries received by the casualties or incidents of such service . While by almost constant legislation since the close of this war there has been compensation awarded for every possible injury received as a result of military service in the Union Army , and while a great number of laws passed for that purpose have been administered with great liberality and have been supplemented by numerous private acts to reach special cases , there has not until now been an avowed departure from the principle thus far adhered to respecting Union soldiers , that the bounty of the Government in the way of pensions is generously bestowed when granted to those who , in this military service and in the line of military duty , have to a greater or less extent been disabled . But it is a mistake to suppose that service pensions , such as are permitted by the second section of the bill under consideration , are new to our legislation . In 1818 , thirty five years after the close of the Revolutionary War , they were granted to the soldiers engaged in that struggle , conditional upon service until the end of the war or for a term not less than nine months , and requiring every beneficiary under the act to be one who is , or hereafter by reason of his reduced circumstances in life shall be , in need of assistance from his country for support . Another law of a like character was passed in 1828 , requiring service until the close of the Revolutionary War and still another , passed in 1832 , provided for those persons not included in the previous statute , but who served two years at some time during the war , and giving a proportionate sum to those who had served not less than six months . A service pension law was passed for the benefit of the soldiers of 1812 in the year 1871 , fifty six years after the close of that war , which required only sixty days service and another was passed in 1878 , sixty three years after the war , requiring only fourteen days service . The service pension bill passed at this session of Congress , thirty nine years after the close of the Mexican War , for the benefit of the soldiers of that war , requires either some degree of disability or dependency or that the claimant under its provisions should be 62 years of age , and in either case that he should have served sixty days or been actually engaged in a battle . It will be seen that the bill of 1818 and the Mexican pension bill , being thus passed nearer the close of the wars in which its beneficiaries were engaged than the others one thirty five years and the other thirty nine years after the termination of such wars embraced persons who were quite advanced in age , assumed to be comparatively few in number , and whose circumstances , dependence , and disabilities were clearly defined and could be quite easily fixed . The other laws referred to appear to have been passed at a time so remote from the military service of the persons which they embraced that their extreme age alone was deemed to supply a presumption of dependency and need . The number of enlistments in the Revolutionary War is stated to be 309 , 791 , and in the War of 1812 576 , 622 but it is estimated that on account of repeated reenlistments the number of individuals engaged in these wars did not exceed one half of the number represented by these figures . In the war with Mexico the number of enlistments is reported to be 112 , 230 , which represents a greater proportion of individuals engaged than the reported enlistments in the two previous wars . The number of pensions granted under all laws to soldiers of the Revolution is given at 62 , 069 to the soldiers of the War of 1812 and their widows , 60 , 178 and to soldiers of the Mexican War and their widows , up to June 30 , 1885 , 7 , 619 . The latter pensions were granted to the soldiers of a war involving much hardship for disabilities incurred as a result of such service and it was not till within the last month that the few remaining survivors were awarded a service pension . The war of the Rebellion terminated nearly twenty two years ago the number of men furnished for its prosecution is stated to be 2 , 772 , 408 . No corresponding number of statutes have ever been passed to cover every kind of injury or disability incurred in the military service of any war . Under these statutes 561 , 571 pensions have been granted from the year 1861 to June 30 , 1886 , and more than 2 , 600 pensioners have been added to the rolls by private acts passed to meet cases , many of them of questionable merit , which the general laws did not cover . On this 1st day of July , 1886 , 365 , 763 pensioners of all classes were upon the pension rolls , of whom 305 , 605 were survivors of the War of the Rebellion and their widows and dependents . For the year ending June 30 , 1887 , 75 , 000 , 000 have been appropriated for the payment of pensions , and the amount expended for that purpose from 1861 to July 1 , 1886 , is 808 , 624 , 811 . 51 . While annually paying out such a vast sum for pensions already granted , it is now proposed by the bill under consideration to award a service pension to the soldiers of all wars in which the United States has been engaged , including of course the War of the Rebellion , and to pay those entitled to the benefits of the act the sum of 12 per month . So far as it relates to the soldiers of the late civil war , the bounty it affords them is given thirteen years earlier than it has been furnished the soldiers of any other war , and before a large majority of its beneficiaries have advanced in age beyond the strength and vigor of the prime of life . It exacts only a military or naval service of three months , without any requirement of actual engagement with an enemy in battle , and without a subjection to any of the actual dangers of war . The pension it awards is allowed to enlisted men who have not suffered the least injury , disability , loss , or damage of any kind , incurred in or in any degree referable to their military service , including those who never reached the front at all and those discharged from rendezvous at the close of the war , if discharged three months after enlistment . Under the last call of the President for troops , in December , 1864 , 11 , 303 men were furnished who were thus discharged . The section allowing this pension does , however , require , besides a service of three months and an honorable discharge , that those seeking the benefit of the act shall be such as are now or may hereafter be suffering from mental or physical disability , not the result of their own vicious habits or gross carelessness , which incapacitates them for the performance of labor in such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support , and who are dependent upon their daily labor for support . It provides further that such persons shall , upon making proof of the fact , be placed on the list of invalid pensioners of the United States , and be entitled to receive for such total inability to procure their subsistence by daily labor 12 per month and such pension shall commence from the date of the filing of the application in the Pension Office , upon proof that the disability then existed , and continue during the existence of the same in the degree herein provided Provided , That persons who are now receiving pensions under existing laws , or whose claims are pending in the Pension Office , may , by application to the Commissioner of Pensions , in such form as he may prescribe , receive the benefit of this act . It is manifestly of the utmost importance that statutes which , like pension laws , should be liberally administered as measures of benevolence in behalf of worthy beneficiaries should admit of no uncertainty as to their general objects and consequences . Upon a careful consideration of the language of the section of this bill above given it seems to me to be so uncertain and liable to such conflicting constructions and to be subject to such unjust and mischievous application as to alone furnish sufficient ground for disapproving the proposed legislation . Persons seeking to obtain the pension provided by this section must be now or hereafter 1 . Suffering from mental or physical disability . 2 . Such disability must not be the result of their own vicious habits or gross carelessness . 3 . Such disability must be such as incapacitates them for the performance of labor in such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support . 4 . They must be dependent upon their daily labor for support . 5 . Upon proof of these conditions they shall be placed on the lists of invalid pensioners of the United States , and be entitled to receive for such total inability to procure their subsistence by daily labor 12 per month . It is not probable that the words last quoted , such total inability to procure their subsistence by daily labor , at all qualify the conditions prescribed in the preceding language of the section . The total inability spoken of must be such inability that is , the inability already described and constituted by the conditions already detailed in the previous parts of the section . It thus becomes important to consider the meaning and the scope of these last mentioned conditions . The mental and physical disability spoken of has a distinct meaning in the practice of the Pension Bureau and includes every impairment of bodily or mental strength and vigor . For such disabilities there are now paid 131 different rates of pension , ranging from 1 to 100 per month . This disability must not be the result of the applicant s vicious habits or gross carelessness . Practically this provision is not important . The attempt of the Government to escape the payment of a pension on such a plea would of course in a very large majority of instances , and regardless of the merits of the case , prove a failure . There would be that strange but nearly universal willingness to help the individual as between him and the public Treasury which goes very far to insure a state of proof in favor of the claimant . The disability of applicants must be such as to incapacitate them for the performance of labor in such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support . It will be observed that there is no limitation or definition of the incapacitating injury or ailment itself . It need only be such a degree of disability from any cause as renders the claimant unable to earn a support by labor . It seems to me that the support here mentioned as one which can not be earned is a complete and entire support , with no diminution on account of the least impairment of physical or mental condition . If it had been intended to embrace only those who by disease or injury were totally unable to labor , it would have been very easy to express that idea , instead of recognizing , as is done , a degree of such inability . What is a support Who is to determine whether a man earns it , or has it , or has it not Is the Government to enter the homes of claimants for pension and after an examination of their surroundings and circumstances settle those questions Shall the Government say to one man that his manner of subsistence by his earnings is a support and to another that the things his earnings furnish are not a support Any attempt , however honest , to administer this law in such a manner would necessarily produce more unfairness and unjust discrimination and give more scope for partisan partiality , and would result in more perversion of the Government s benevolent intentions , than the execution of any statute ought to permit . If in the effort to carry out the proposed law the degree of disability as related to earnings be considered for the purpose of discovering if in any way it curtails the support which the applicant , if entirely sound , would earn , and to which he is entitled , we enter the broad field long occupied by the Pension Bureau , and we recognize as the only difference between the proposed legislation and previous laws passed for the benefit of the surviving soldiers of the Civil War the incurrence in one case of disabilities in military service and in the other disabilities existing , but in no way connected with or resulting from such service . It must be borne in mind that in no case is there any grading of this proposed pension . Under the operation of the rule first suggested , if there is a lack in any degree , great or small , of the ability to earn such a support as the Government determines the claimant should have , and , by the application of the rule secondly suggested , if there is a reduction in any degree of the support which he might earn if sound , he is entitled to a pension of 12 . In the latter case , and under the proviso of the proposed bill permitting persons now receiving pensions to be admitted to the benefits of the act , I do not see how those now on the pension roll for disabilities incurred in the service , and which diminish their earning capacity , can be denied the pension provided in this bill . Of course none will apply who are now receiving 12 or more per month . But on the 30th day of June , 1886 , there were on the pension rolls 202 , 621 persons who were receiving fifty eight different rates of pension from 1 to 11 . 75 per month . Of these , 28 , 142 were receiving 2 per month 63 , 116 , 4 per month 37 , 254 , 6 per month , and 50 , 274 , whose disabilities were rated as total , 8 per month . As to the meaning of the section of the bill under consideration there appears to have been quite a difference of opinion among its advocates in the Congress . The chairman of the Committee on Pensions in the House of Representatives , who reported the bill , declared that there was in it no provision for pensioning anyone who has a less disability than a total inability to labor , and that it was a charity measure . The chairman of the Committee on Pensions in the Senate , having charge of the bill in that body , dissented from the construction of the bill announced in the House of Representatives , and declared that it not only embraced all soldiers totally disabled , but , in his judgment , all who are disabled to any considerable extent and such a construction was substantially given to the bill by another distinguished Senator , who , as a former Secretary of the Interior , had imposed upon him the duty of executing pension laws and determining their intent and meaning . Another condition required of claimants under this act is that they shall be dependent upon their daily labor for support . This language , which may be said to assume that there exists within the reach of the persons mentioned labor , or the ability in some degree to work , is more aptly used in a statute describing those not wholly deprived of this ability than in one which deals with those utterly unable to work . I am of the opinion that it may fairly be contended that under the provisions of this section any soldier whose faculties of mind or body have become impaired by accident , disease , or age , irrespective of his service in the Army as a cause , and who by his labor only is left incapable of gaining the fair support he might with unimpaired powers have provided for himself , and who is not so well endowed with this world s goods as to live without work may claim to participate in its bounty that it is not required that he should be without property , but only that labor should be necessary to his support in some degree nor is it required that he should be now receiving support from others . Believing this to be the proper interpretation of the bill , I can not but remember that the soldiers of our Civil War in their pay and bounty received such compensation for military service as has never been received by soldiers before since mankind first went to war that never before on behalf of any soldiery have so many and such generous laws been passed to relieve against the incidents of war that statutes have been passed giving them a preference in all public employments that the really needy and homeless Union soldiers of the rebellion have been to a large extent provided for at soldiers homes , instituted and supported by the Government , where they are maintained together , free from the sense of degradation which attaches to the usual support of charity and that never before in the history of the country has it been proposed to render Government aid toward the support of any of its soldiers based alone upon a military service so recent , and where age and circumstances appeared so little to demand such aid . Hitherto such relief has been granted to surviving soldiers few in number , venerable in age , after a long lapse of time since their military service , and as a parting benefaction tendered by a grateful people . I can not believe that the vast peaceful army of Union soldiers , who , having contentedly resumed their places in the ordinary avocations of life , cherish as sacred the memory of patriotic service , or who , having been disabled by the casualties of war , justly regard the present pension roll on which appear their names as a roll of honor , desire at this time and in the present exigency to be confounded with those who through such a bill as this are willing to be objects of simple charity and to gain a place upon the pension roll through alleged dependence . Recent personal observation and experience constrain me to refer to another result which will inevitably follow the passage of this bill . It is sad , but nevertheless true , that already in the matter of procuring pensions there exists a widespread disregard of truth and good faith , stimulated by those who as agents undertake to establish claims for pensions heedlessly entered upon by the expectant beneficiary , and encouraged , or at least not condemned , by those unwilling to obstruct a neighbor s plans . In the execution of this proposed law under any interpretation a wide field of inquiry would be opened for the establishment of facts largely within the knowledge of the claimants alone , and there can be no doubt that the race after the pensions offered by this bill would not only stimulate weakness and pretended incapacity for labor , but put a further premium on dishonesty and mendacity . The effect of new invitations to apply for pensions or of new advantages added to causes for pensions already existing is sometimes startling . Thus in March , 1879 , large arrearages of pensions were allowed to be added to all claims filed prior to July 1 , 1880 . For the year from July 1 , 1879 , to July 1 , 1880 , there were filed 110 , 673 claims , though in the year immediately previous there were but 36 , 832 filed , and in the year following but 18 , 455 . While cost should not be set against a patriotic duty or the recognition of a right , still when a measure proposed is based upon generosity or motives of charity it is not amiss to meditate somewhat upon the expense which it involves . Experience has demonstrated , I believe , that all estimates concerning the probable future cost of a pension list are uncertain and unreliable and always fall far below actual realization . The chairman of the House Committee on Pensions calculates that the number of pensioners under this bill would be 33 , 105 and the increased cost 4 , 767 , 120 . This is upon the theory that only those who are entirely unable to work would be its beneficiaries . Such was the principle of the Revolutionary pension law of 1818 , much more clearly stated , it seems to me , than in this bill . When the law of 1818 was upon its passage in Congress , the number of pensioners to be benefitted thereby was thought to be 374 , but the number of applicants under the act was 22 , 297 , and the number of pensions actually allowed 20 , 485 , costing , it is reported , for the first year , 1 , 847 , 900 , instead of 40 , 000 , the estimated expense for that period . A law was passed in 1853 for the benefit of the surviving widows of Revolutionary soldiers who were married after January 1 , 1800 . It was estimated that they numbered 300 at the time of the passage of the act but the number of pensions allowed was 3 , 742 , and the amount paid for such pensions during the first year of the operation of the act was 180 , 000 , instead of 24 , 000 , as had been estimated . I have made no search for other illustrations , and the above , being at hand , are given as tending to show that estimates can not be relied upon in such cases . If none should be pensioned under this bill except those utterly unable to work , I am satisfied that the cost stated in the estimate referred to would be many times multiplied , and with a constant increase from year to year and if those partially unable to earn their support should be admitted to the privileges of this bill , the probable increase of expense would be almost appalling . I think it may be said that at the close of the War of the Rebellion every Northern State and a great majority of Northern counties and cities were burdened with taxation on account of the large bounties paid our soldiers and the bonded debt thereby created still constitutes a large item in the account of the taxgatherer against the people . Federal taxation , no less borne by the people than that directly levied upon their property , is still maintained at the rate made necessary by the exigencies of war . If this bill should become a law , with its tremendous addition to our pension obligation , I am thoroughly convinced that further efforts to reduce the Federal revenue and restore some part of it to our people will , and perhaps should , be seriously questioned . It has constantly been a cause of pride and congratulation to the American citizen that his country is not put to the charge of maintaining a large standing army in time of peace . Yet we are now living under a war tax which has been tolerated in peaceful times to meet the obligations incurred in war . But for years past , in all parts of the country , the demand for the reduction of the burdens of taxation upon our labor and production has increased in volume and urgency . I am not willing to approve a measure presenting the objections to which this bill is subject , and which , moreover , will have the effect of disappointing the expectation of the people and their desire and hope for relief from war taxation in time of peace . In my last annual message the following language was used Every patriotic heart responds to a tender consideration for those who , having served their country long and well , are reduced to destitution and dependence , not as an incident of their service , but with advancing age or through sickness or misfortune . We are all tempted by the contemplation of such a condition to supply relief and are often impatient of the limitations of public duty . Yielding to no one in the desire to indulge this feeling of consideration , I can not rid myself of the conviction that if these ex soldiers are to be relieved they and their cause are entitled to the benefit of an enactment under which relief may be claimed as a right , and that such relief should be granted under the sanction of law , not in evasion of it nor should such worthy objects of care , all equally entitled , be remitted to the unequal operation of sympathy or the tender mercies of social and political influence , with their unjust discriminations . I do not think that the objects , the conditions , and the limitations thus suggested are contained in the bill under consideration . I adhere to the sentiments thus heretofore expressed . But the evil threatened by this bill is , in my opinion , such that , charged with a great responsibility in behalf of the people , I can not do otherwise than to bring to the consideration of this measure my best efforts of thought and judgment and perform my constitutional duty in relation thereto , regardless of all consequences except such as appear to me to be related to the best and highest interests of the country .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Whereas the island of Cuba is now the seat of serious civil disturbances , accompanied by armed resistance to the authority of the established Government of Spain , a power with which the United States are and desire to remain on terms of peace and amity and Whereas the laws of the United States prohibit their citizens , as well as all others being within and subject to their jurisdiction , from taking part in such disturbances adversely to such established Government , by accepting or exercising commissions for warlike service against it , by enlistment or procuring others to enlist for such service , by fitting out or arming or procuring to be fitted out and armed ships of war for such service , by augmenting the force of any ship of war engaged in such service and arriving in a port of the United States , and by setting on foot or providing or preparing the means for military enterprises to be carried on from the United States against the territory of such Government Now , therefore , in recognition of the laws aforesaid and in discharge of the obligations of the United States toward a friendly power , and as a measure of precaution , and to the end that citizens of the United States and all others within their jurisdiction may be deterred from subjecting themselves to legal forfeitures and penalties , Grover Cleveland , President of the United States of America , do hereby admonish all such citizens and other persons to abstain from every violation of the laws hereinbefore referred to , and do hereby warn them that all violations of such laws will be rigorously prosecuted and I do hereby enjoin upon all officers of the United States charged with the execution of said laws the utmost diligence in preventing violations thereof and in bringing to trial and punishment any offenders against the same .
