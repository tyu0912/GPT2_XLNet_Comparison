In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . ANDREW JOHNSON . By the President HUNTER , Acting Secretary of State<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I regret that the bill , which has passed both Houses of Congress , entitled An act to protect all persons in the United States in their civil rights and furnish the means of their vindication , contains provisions which I can not approve consistently with my sense of duty to the whole people and my obligations to the Constitution of the United States . I am therefore constrained to return it to the Senate , the House in which it originated , with my objections to its becoming a law . By the first section of the bill all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power , excluding Indians not taxed , are declared to be citizens of the United States . This provision comprehends the Chinese of the Pacific States , Indians subject to taxation , the people called gypsies , as well as the entire race designated as blacks , people of color . Negroes , mulattoes , and persons of African blood . Every individual of these races born in the United States is by the bill made a citizen of the United States . It does not purport to declare or confer any other right of citizenship than Federal citizenship . It does not purport to give these classes of persons any status as citizens of States , except that which may result from their status as citizens of the United States . The power to confer the right of State citizenship is just as exclusively with the several States as the power to confer the right of Federal citizenship is with Congress . The right of Federal citizenship thus to be conferred on the several excepted races before mentioned is now for the first time proposed to be given by law . If , as is claimed by many , all persons who are native born already are , by virtue of the Constitution , citizens of the United States , the passage of the pending bill can not be necessary to make them such . If , on the other hand , such persons are not citizens , as may be assumed from the proposed legislation to make them such , the grave question presents itself whether , when eleven of the thirty six States are unrepresented in Congress at the present time , it is sound policy to make our entire colored population and all other excepted classes citizens of the United States . Four millions of them have just emerged from slavery into freedom . Can it be reasonably supposed that they possess the requisite qualifications to entitle them to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States Have the people of the several States expressed such a conviction It may also be asked whether it is necessary that they should be declared citizens in order that they may be secured in the enjoyment of the civil rights proposed to be conferred by the bill . Those rights are , by Federal as well as State laws , secured to all domiciled aliens and foreigners , even before the completion of the process of naturalization and it may safely be assumed that the same enactments are sufficient to give like protection and benefits to those for whom this bill provides special legislation . Besides , the policy of the Government from its origin to the present time seems to have been that persons who are strangers to and unfamiliar with our institutions and our laws should pass through a certain probation , at the end of which , before attaining the coveted prize , they must give evidence of their fitness to receive and to exercise the rights of citizens as contemplated by the Constitution of the United States . The bill in effect proposes a discrimination against large numbers of intelligent , worthy , and patriotic foreigners , and in favor of the Negro , to whom , after long years of bondage , the avenues to freedom and intelligence have just now been suddenly opened . He must of necessity , from his previous unfortunate condition of servitude , be less informed as to the nature and character of our institutions than he who , coming from abroad , has , to some extent at least , familiarized himself with the principles of a Government to which he voluntarily intrusts life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Yet it is now proposed , by a single legislative enactment , to confer the rights of citizens upon all persons of African descent born within the extended limits of the United States , while persons of foreign birth who make our land their home must undergo a probation of five years , and can only then become citizens upon proof that they are of good moral character , attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States , and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same . The first section of the bill also contains an enumeration of the rights to be enjoyed by these classes so made citizens in every State and Territory in the United States . These rights are to make and enforce contracts to sue , be parties , and give evidence to inherit , purchase , lease , sell , hold , and convey real and personal property , and to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens . So , too , they are made subject to the same punishment , pains , and penalties in common with white citizens , and to none other . Thus a perfect equality of the white and colored races is attempted to be fixed by Federal law in every State of the Union over the vast field of State jurisdiction covered by these enumerated rights . In no one of these can any State ever exercise any power of discrimination between the different races . In the exercise of State policy over matters exclusively affecting the people of each State it has frequently been thought expedient to discriminate between the two races . By the statutes of some of the States , Northern as well as Southern , it is enacted , for instance , that no white person shall intermarry with a Negro or mulatto . Chancellor Kent says , speaking of the blacks , Marriages between them and the whites are forbidden in some of the States where slavery does not exist , and they are prohibited in all the slaveholding States and when not absolutely contrary to law , they are revolting , and regarded as an offense against public decorum . I do not say that this bill repeals State laws on the subject of marriage between the two races , for as the whites are forbidden to intermarry with the blacks , the blacks can only make such contracts as the whites themselves are allowed to make , and therefore can not under this bill enter into the marriage contract with the whites . I cite this discrimination , however , as an instance of the State policy as to discrimination , and to inquire whether if Congress can abrogate all State laws of discrimination between the two races in the matter of real estate , of suits , and of contracts generally Congress may not also repeal the State laws as to the contract of marriage between the two races . Hitherto every subject embraced in the enumeration of rights contained in this bill has been considered as exclusively belonging to the States . They all relate to the internal police and economy of the respective States . They are matters which in each State concern the domestic condition of its people , varying in each according to its own peculiar circumstances and the safety and well being of its own citizens . I do not mean to say that upon all these subjects there are not Federal restraints as , for instance , in the State power of legislation over contracts there is a Federal limitation that no State shall pass a law impairing the obligations of contracts and , as to crimes , that no State shall pass an ex post facto law and , as to money , that no State shall make anything but gold and silver a legal tender but where can we find a Federal prohibition against the power of any State to discriminate , as do most of them , between aliens and citizens , between artificial persons , called corporations , and natural persons , in the right to hold real estate If it be granted that Congress can repeal all State laws discriminating between whites and blacks in the subjects covered by this bill , why , it may be asked , may not Congress repeal in the same way all State laws discriminating between the two races on the subjects of suffrage and office If Congress can declare by law who shall hold lands , who shall testify , who shall have capacity to make a contract in a State , then Congress can by law also declare who , without regard to color or race , shall have the right to sit as a juror or as a judge , to hold any office , and , finally , to vote in every State and Territory of the United States . As respects the Territories , they come within the power of Congress , for as to them the lawmaking power is the Federal power but as to the States no similar provision exists vesting in Congress the power to make rules and regulations for them . The object of the second section of the bill is to afford discriminating protection to colored persons in the full enjoyment of all the rights secured to them by the preceding section . It declares That any person who , under color of any law , statute , ordinance , regulation , or custom , shall subject , or cause to be subjected , any inhabitant of any State or Territory to the deprivation of any right secured or protected by this act , or to different punishment , pains , or penalties on account of such person having at any time been held in a condition of slavery or involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , or by reason of his color or race , than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons , shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . and on conviction shall be punished by fine not exceeding 1 , 000 , or imprisonment not exceeding one year , or both , in the discretion of the court . This section seems to be designed to apply to some existing or future law of a State or Territory which may conflict with the provisions of the bill now under consideration . It provides for counteracting such forbidden legislation by imposing fine and imprisonment upon the legislators who may pass such conflicting laws , or upon the officers or agents who shall put or attempt to put them into execution . It means an official offense , not a common crime committed against law upon the persons or property of the black race . Such an act may deprive the black man of his property , but not of the right to hold property . It means a deprivation of the right itself , either by the State judiciary or the State legislature It is therefore assumed that under this section members of State legislatures who should vote for laws conflicting with the provisions of the bill , that judges of the State courts who should render judgments in antagonism with its terms , and that marshals and sheriffs who should , as ministerial officers , execute processes sanctioned by State laws and issued by State judges in execution of their judgments could be brought before other tribunals and there subjected to fine and imprisonment for the performance of the duties which such State laws might impose . The legislation thus proposed invades the judicial power of the State . It says to every State court or judge , If you decide that this act is unconstitutional if you refuse , under the prohibition of a State law , to allow a Negro to testify if you hold that over such a subject matter the State law is paramount , and under color of a State law refuse the exercise of the right to the Negro , your error of judgment , however conscientious , shall subject you to fine and imprisonment . I do not apprehend that the conflicting legislation which the bill seems to contemplate is so likely to occur as to render it necessary at this time to adopt a measure of such doubtful constitutionality . In the next place , this provision of the bill seems to be unnecessary , as adequate judicial remedies could be adopted to secure the desired end without invading the immunities of legislators , always important to be preserved in the interest of public liberty without assailing the independence of the judiciary , always essential to the preservation of individual rights and without impairing the efficiency of ministerial officers , always necessary for the maintenance of public peace and order . The remedy proposed by this section seems to be in this respect not only anomalous , but unconstitutional for the Constitution guarantees nothing with certainty if it does not insure to the several States the right of making and executing laws in regard to all matters arising within their jurisdiction , subject only to the restriction that in cases of conflict with the Constitution and constitutional laws of the United States the latter should be held to be the supreme law of the land . The third section gives the district courts of the United States exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offenses committed against the provisions of this act , and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts of the United States of all civil and criminal cases affecting persons who are denied or can not enforce in the courts or judicial tribunals of the State or locality where they may be any of the rights secured to them by the first section . The construction which I have given to the second section is strengthened by this third section , for it makes clear what kind of denial or deprivation of the rights secured by the first section was in contemplation . It is a denial or deprivation of such rights in the courts or judicial tribunals of the State . It stands , therefore , clear of doubt that the offense and the penalties provided in the second section are intended for the State judge who , in the clear exercise of his functions as a judge , not acting ministerially but judicially , shall decide contrary to this Federal law . In other words , when a State judge , acting upon a question involving a conflict between a State law and a Federal law , and bound , according to his own judgment and responsibility , to give an impartial decision between the two , comes to the conclusion that the State law is valid and the Federal law is invalid , he must not follow the dictates of his own judgment , at the peril of fine and imprisonment . The legislative department of the Government of the United States thus takes from the judicial department of the States the sacred and exclusive duty of judicial decision , and converts the State judge into a mere ministerial officer , bound to decide according to the will of Congress . It is clear that in States which deny to persons whose rights are secured by the first section of the bill any one of those rights all criminal and civil cases affecting them will , by the provisions of the third section , come under the exclusive cognizance of the Federal tribunals . It follows that if , in any State which denies to a colored person any one of all those rights , that person should commit a crime against the laws of a State murder , arson , rape , or any other crime all protection and punishment through the courts of the State are taken away , and he can only be tried and punished in the Federal courts . How is the criminal to be tried If the offense is provided for and punished by Federal law , that law , and not the State law , is to govern . It is only when the offense does not happen to be within the purview of Federal law that the Federal courts are to try and punish him under any other law . Then resort is to be had to the common law , as modified and changed by State legislation , so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States . So that over this vast domain of criminal jurisprudence provided by each State for the protection of its own citizens and for the punishment of all persons who violate its criminal laws , Federal law , whenever it can be made to apply , displaces State law . The question here naturally arises , from what source Congress derives the power to transfer to Federal tribunals certain classes of cases embraced in this section . The Constitution expressly declares that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to controversies to which the United States shall be a party to controversies between two or more States , between a State and citizens of another State , between citizens of different States , between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States , and between a State , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens , or subjects . Here the judicial power of the United States is expressly set forth and defined and the act of September 24 . 1789 , establishing the judicial courts of the United States , in conferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction over cases originating in State tribunals , is careful to confine them to the classes enumerated in the above recited clause of the Constitution . This section of the bill undoubtedly comprehends cases and authorizes the exercise of powers that are not , by the Constitution , within the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States . To transfer them to those courts would be an exercise of authority well calculated to excite distrust and alarm on the part of all the States , for the bill applies alike to all of them as well to those that have as to those that have not been engaged in rebellion . It may be assumed that this authority is incident to the power granted to Congress by the Constitution , as recently amended , to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the article declaring that Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction . It can not , however , be justly claimed that , with a view to the enforcement of this article of the Constitution , there is at present any necessity for the exercise of all the powers which this bill confers . Slavery has been abolished , and at present nowhere exists within the jurisdiction of the United States nor has there been , nor is it likely there will be , any attempt to revive it by the people or the States . If , however , any such attempt shall be made , it will then become the duty of the General Government to exercise any and all incidental powers necessary and proper to maintain inviolate this great constitutional law of freedom . The fourth section of the bill provides that officers and agents of the Freedmen s Bureau shall be empowered to make arrests , and also that other officers may be specially commissioned for that purpose by the President of the United States . It also authorizes circuit courts of the United States and the superior courts of the Territories to appoint , without limitation , commissioners , who are to be charged with the performance of quasi judicial duties . The fifth section empowers the commissioners so to be selected by the courts to appoint in writing , under their hands , one or more suitable persons from time to time to execute warrants and other processes described by the bill . These numerous official agents are made to constitute a sort of police , in addition to the military , and are authorized to summon a posse comitatus , and even to call to their aid such portion of the land and naval forces of the United States , or of the militia , as may be necessary to the performance of the duty with which they are charged . This extraordinary power is to be conferred upon agents irresponsible to the Government and to the people , to whose number the discretion of the commissioners is the only limit , and in whose hands such authority might be made a terrible engine of wrong , oppression , and fraud . The general statutes regulating the land and naval forces of the United States , the militia , and the execution of the laws are believed to be adequate for every emergency which can occur in time of peace . If it should prove otherwise , Congress can at any time amend those laws in such manner as , while subserving the public welfare , not to jeopard the rights , interests , and liberties of the people . The seventh section provides that a fee of 10 shall be paid to each commissioner in every case brought before him , and a fee of 5 to his deputy or deputies for each person he or they may arrest and take before any such commissioner , with such other fees as may be deemed reasonable by such commissioner , in general for performing such other duties as may be required in the premises . All these fees are to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States , whether there is a conviction or not but in case of conviction they are to be recoverable from the defendant . It seems to me that under the influence of such temptations bad men might convert any law , however beneficent , into an instrument of persecution and fraud . By the eighth section of the bill the United States courts , which sit only in one place for white citizens , must migrate with the marshal and district attorney and necessarily with the clerk , although he is not mentioned to any part of the district upon the order of the President , and there hold a court , for the purpose of the more speedy arrest and trial of persons charged with a violation of this act and there the judge and officers of the court must remain , upon the order of the President , for the time therein designated . The ninth section authorizes the President , or such person as he may empower for that purpose , to employ such part of the land or naval forces of the United States , or of the militia , as shall be necessary to prevent the violation and enforce the due execution of this act . This language seems to imply a permanent military force , that is to be always at hand , and whose only business is to be the enforcement of this measure over the vast region where it is intended to operate . I do not propose to consider the policy of this bill . To me the details of the bill seem fraught with evil . The white race and the black race of the South have hitherto lived together under the relation of master and slave capital owning labor . Now , suddenly , that relation is changed , and as to ownership capital and labor are divorced . They stand now each master of itself . In this new relation , one being necessary to the other , there will be a new adjustment , which both are deeply interested in making harmonious . Each has equal power in settling the terms , and if left to the laws that regulate capital and labor it is confidently believed that they will satisfactorily work out the problem . Capital , it is true , has more intelligence , but labor is never so ignorant as not to understand its own interests , not to know its own value , and not to see that capital must pay that value . This bill frustrates this adjustment . It intervenes between capital and labor and attempts to settle questions of political economy through the agency of numerous officials whose interest it will be to foment discord between the two races , for as the breach widens their employment will continue , and when it is closed their occupation will terminate . In all our history , in all our experience as a people living under Federal and State law , no such system as that contemplated by the details of this bill has ever before been proposed or adopted . They establish for the security of the colored race safeguards which go infinitely beyond any that the General Government has ever provided for the white race . In fact , the distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race . They interfere with the municipal legislation of the States , with the relations existing exclusively between a State and its citizens , or between inhabitants of the same State an absorption and assumption of power by the General Government which , if acquiesced in , must sap and destroy our federative system of limited powers and break down the barriers which preserve the rights of the States . It is another step , or rather stride , toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative powers in the National Government . The tendency of the bill must be to resuscitate the spirit of rebellion and to arrest the progress of those influences which are more closely drawing around the States the bonds of union and peace . My lamented predecessor , in his proclamation of the 1st of January , 1863 , ordered and declared that all persons held as slaves within certain States and parts of States therein designated were and thenceforward should be free and further , that the executive government of the United States , including the military and naval authorities thereof , would recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons . This guaranty has been rendered especially obligatory and sacred by the amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States . I therefore fully recognize the obligation to protect and defend that class of our people whenever and wherever it shall become necessary , and to the full extent compatible with the Constitution of the United States . Entertaining these sentiments , it only remains for me to say that I will cheerfully cooperate with Congress in any measure that may be necessary for the protection of the civil rights of the freedmen , as well as those of all other classes of persons throughout the United States , by judicial process , under equal and impartial laws , in conformity with the provisions of the Federal Constitution . I now return the bill to the Senate , and regret that in considering the bills and joint resolutions forty two in number which have been thus far submitted for my approval I am compelled to withhold my assent from a second measure that has received the sanction of both Houses of Congress .<speech_sep>GENTLEMEI must be permitted to say that I have been almost overwhelmed by the announcement of the sad event which has so recently occurred . I feel incompetent to perform duties so important and responsible as those which have been so unexpectedly thrown upon me . As to an indication of any policy which may be pursued by me in the administration of the Government , I have to say that that must be left for development as the Administration progresses . The message or declaration must be made by the acts as they transpire . The only assurance that I can now give of the future is reference to the past . The course which I have taken in the past in connection with this rebellion must be regarded as a guaranty of the future . My past public life , which has been long and laborious , has been founded , as I in good conscience believe , upon a great principle of right , which lies at the basis of all things . The best energies of my life have been spent in endeavoring to establish and perpetuate the principles of free government , and I believe that the Government in passing through its present perils will settle down upon principles consonant with popular rights more permanent and enduring than heretofore . I must be permitted to say , if I understand the feelings of my own heart , that I have long labored to ameliorate and elevate the condition of the great mass of the American people . Toil and an honest advocacy of the great principles of free government have been my lot . Duties have been mine consequences are God s . This has been the foundation of my political creed , and I feel that in the end the Government will triumph and that these great principles will be permanently established . In conclusion , gentlemen , let me say that I want your encouragement and countenance . I shall ask and rely upon you and others in carrying the Government through its present perils . I feel in making this request that it will be heartily responded to by you and all other patriots and lovers of the rights and interests of a free people .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States In reply to the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 12th instant , I have the honor to state that the rebellion waged by a portion of the people against the properly constituted authority of the Government of the United States has been suppressed that the United States are in possession of every State in which the insurrection existed , and that as far as it could be done , the courts of the United States have been restored , post offices reestablished , and steps taken to put into effective operation the revenue laws of the country . As the result of the measures instituted by the Executive with the view of inducing a resumption of the functions of the States comprehended in the inquiry of the Senate , the people of North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , Arkansas , and Tennessee have reorganized their respective State governments , and are yielding obedience to the laws and Government of the United States with more willingness and greater promptitude than under the circumstances could reasonably have been anticipated . The proposed amendment to the Constitution , providing for the abolition of slavery forever within the limits of the country , has been ratified by each one of those States , with the exception of Mississippi , from which no official information has been received , and in nearly all of them measures have been adopted or are now pending to confer upon freedmen the privileges which are essential to their comfort , protection , and security . In Florida and Texas the people are making commendable progress in restoring their State governments , and no doubt is entertained that they will at an early period be in a condition to resume all of their practical relations with the General Government . In that portion of the Union lately in rebellion the aspect of affairs is more promising than , in view of all the circumstances could well have been expected . The people throughout the entire South evince a laudable desire to renew their allegiance to the Government and to repair the devastations of war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful pursuits , and abiding faith is entertained that their actions will conform to their professions , and that in acknowledging the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States their loyalty will be unreservedly given to the Government , whose leniency they can not fail to appreciate and whose fostering care will soon restore them to a condition of prosperity . It is true that in some of the States the demoralizing effects of the war are to be seen in occasional disorders but these are local in character , not frequent in occurrence , and are rapidly disappearing as the authority of civil law is extended and sustained . Perplexing questions are naturally to be expected from the great and sudden change in the relations between the two races but system are gradually developing themselves under which the freedman will receive the protection to which he is justly entitled , and , by means of his labor , make himself a useful and independent member in the community in which he has a home . From all the information in my possession and from that which I have recently derived from the most reliable authority I am induced to cherish the belief that sectional animosity is surely and rapidly merging itself into a spirit of nationality , and that representation , connected with a properly adjusted system of taxation , will result in a harmonious restoration of the relation of the States to the National Union . The report of Carl Schurz is herewith transmitted , as requested by the Senate . No reports from the John Coyode have been received by the President . The attention of the Senate is invited to the accompanying report from Lieutenant General Grant , who recently made a tour of inspection through several of the States whose inhabitants participated in the rebellion .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States On the 12th of August last I suspended Stanton from the exercise of the office of Secretary of War , and on the same day designated General Grant to act as Secretary of War ad interim . The following are copies of the Executive orders EXECUTIVE MANSION , Washington , August 12 , 1867 . EDWIN STANTON , Secretary of War . SIBy virtue of the power and authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States , you are hereby suspended from office as Secretary of War , and will cease to exercise any and all functions pertaining to the same . You will at once transfer to General Ulysses Grant , who has this day been authorized and empowered to act as Secretary of War ad interim , all records , books , and other property now in your custody and charge . EXECUTIVE MANSION , Washington , C . , August 12 , 1867 . General ULYSSES GRANT , Washington , C . SIThe Edwin Stanton having been this day suspended as Secretary of War , you are hereby authorized and empowered to act as Secretary of War ad interim , and will at once enter upon the discharge of the duties of the office . The Secretary of War has been instructed to transfer to you all the records , books , papers , and other public property now in his custody and charge . The following communication was received from Stanton WAR DEPARTMENT , August 12 , 1867 . The PRESIDENT . SIYour note of this date has been received , informing me that by virtue of the powers and authority vested in you as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States I am suspended from office as Secretary of War , and will cease to exercise any and all functions pertaining to the same , and also directing me at once to transfer to General Ulysses Grant , who has this day been authorized and empowered to act as Secretary of War ad interim , all records , books , papers , and other public property now in my custody and charge . Under a sense of public duty I am compelled to deny your right under the Constitution and laws of the United States , without the advice and consent of the Senate and without any legal cause , to suspend me from office as Secretary of War or the exercise of any or all functions pertaining to the same , or without such advice and consent to compel me to transfer to any person the records , books , papers , and public property in my custody as Secretary . But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States has been appointed ad interim , and has notified me that he has accepted the appointment , I have no alternative but to submit , under protest , to superior force . To the PRESIDENT . The suspension has not been revoked , and the business of the War Department is conducted by the Secretary ad interim . Prior to the date of this suspension I had come to the conclusion that the time had arrived when it was proper Stanton should retire from my Cabinet . The mutual confidence and general accord which should exist in such a relation had ceased . I supposed that Stanton was well advised that his continuance in the Cabinet was contrary to my wishes , for I had repeatedly given him so to understand by every mode short of an express request that he should resign . Having waited full time for the voluntary action of Stanton , and seeing no manifestation on his part of an intention to resign , I addressed him the following note on the 5th of August Sir Public considerations of a high character constrain me to say that your resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted . To this note I received the following reply WAR DEPARTMENT , August 5 , 1867 . Sir Your note of this day has been received , stating that public considerations of a high character constrain you to say that my resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted . In reply I have the honor to say that public considerations of a high character , which alone have induced me to continue at the head of this Department , constrain me not to resign the office of Secretary of War before the next meeting of Congress . EDWIN STANTON Secretary of War This reply of Stanton was not merely a disinclination of compliance with the request for his resignation it was a defiance , and something more . Stanton does not content himself with assuming that public considerations bearing upon his continuance in office form as fully a rule of action for himself as for the President , and that upon so delicate a question as the fitness of an officer for continuance in his office the officer is as competent and as impartial to decide as his superior , who is responsible for his conduct . But he goes further , and plainly intimates what he means by public considerations of a high character , and this is nothing else than his loss of confidence in his superior . He says that these public considerations have alone induced me to continue at the head of this Department , and that they constrain me not to resign the office of Secretary of War before the next meeting of Congress . This language is very significant . Stanton holds the position unwillingly . He continues in office only under a sense of high public duty . He is ready to leave when it is safe to leave , and as the danger he apprehends from his removal then will not exist when Congress is here , he is constrained to remain during the interim . What , then , is that danger which can only be averted by the presence of Stanton or of Congress Stanton does not say that public considerations of a high character constrain him to hold on to the office indefinitely . He does not say that no one other than himself can at any time be found to take his place and perform its duties . On the contrary , he expresses a desire to leave the office at the earliest moment consistent with these high public considerations . He says , in effect , that while Congress is away he must remain , but that when Congress is here he can go . In other words , he has lost confidence in the President . He is unwilling to leave the War Department in his hands or in the hands of anyone the President may appoint or designate to perform its duties . If he resigns , the President may appoint a Secretary of War that Stanton does not approve therefore he will not resign . But when Congress is in session the President can not appoint a Secretary of War which the Senate does not approve consequently when Congress meets Stanton is ready to resign . Whatever cogency these considerations may have had on Stanton , whatever right he may have had to entertain such considerations , whatever propriety there might be in the expression of them to others , one thing is certain , it was official misconduct , to say the least of it , to parade them before his superior officer . Upon the receipt of this extraordinary note I only delayed the order of suspension long enough to make the necessary arrangements to fill the office . If this were the only cause for his suspension , it would be ample . Necessarily it must end our most important official relations , for I can not imagine a degree of effrontery which would embolden the head of a Department to take his seat at the council table in the Executive Mansion after such an act nor can I imagine a President so forgetful of the proper respect and dignity which belong to his office as to submit to such intrusion . I will not do Stanton the wrong to suppose that he entertained any idea of offering to act as one of my constitutional advisers after that note was written . There was an interval of a week between that date and the order of suspension , during which two Cabinet meetings were held . Stanton did not present himself at either , nor was he expected . On the 12th of August Stanton was notified of his suspension and that General Grant had been authorized to take charge of the Department . In his answer to this notification , of the same date , Stanton expresses himself as follows Under a sense of public duty , I am compelled to deny your fight under the Constitution and laws of the United States , without the advice and consent of the Senate and without any legal cause , to suspend me from office as Secretary of War or the exercise of any or all functions pertaining to the same , or without such advice and consent to compel me to transfer to any person the records , books , papers , and public property in my custody as Secretary . But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States has been appointed ad interim , and has notified me that he has accepted the appointment , I have no alternative but to submit , under protest , to superior force . It will not escape attention that in his note of August 5 Stanton stated that he had been constrained to continue in the office , even before he was requested to resign , by considerations of a high public character . In this note of August 12 a new and different sense of public duty compels him to deny the President s right to suspend him from office without the consent of the Senate . This last is the public duty of resisting an act contrary to law , and he charges the President with violation of the law in ordering his suspension . Stanton refers generally to the Constitution and laws of the United States , and says that a sense of public duty under these compels him to deny the right of the President to suspend him from office . As to his sense of duty under the Constitution , that will be considered in the sequel . As to his sense of duty under the laws of the United States , he certainly can not refer to the law which creates the War Department , for that expressly confers upon the President the unlimited right to remove the head of the Department . The only other law bearing upon the question is the tenure of office act , passed by Congress over the Presidential veto March 2 , 1867 . This is the law which , under a sense of public duty , Stanton volunteers to defend . There is no provision in this law which compels any officer coming within its provisions to remain in office . It forbids removals not resignations . Stanton was perfectly free to resign at any moment , either upon his own motion or in compliance with a request or an order . It was a matter of choice or of taste . There was nothing compulsory in the nature of legal obligation . Nor does he put his action upon that imperative ground . He says he acts under a sense of public duty , not of legal obligation , compelling him to hold on and leaving him no choice . The public duty which is upon him arises from the respect which he owes to the Constitution and the laws , violated in his own case . He is therefore compelled by this sense of public duty to vindicate violated law and to stand as its champion . This was not the first occasion in which Stanton , in discharge of a public duty , was called upon to consider the provisions of that law . That tenure of office law did not pass without notice . Like other acts , it was sent to the President for approval . As is my custom , I submitted its consideration to my Cabinet for their advice upon the question whether I should approve it or not . It was a grave question of constitutional law , in which I would , of course , rely most upon the opinion of the Attorney General and of Stanton , who had once been Attorney General . Every member of my Cabinet advised me that the proposed law was unconstitutional . All spoke without doubt or reservation , but Stanton s condemnation of the law was the most elaborate and emphatic . He referred to the constitutional provisions , the debates in Congress , especially to the speech of Buchanan when a Senator , to the decisions of the Supreme Court , and to the usage from the beginning of the Government through every successive Administration , all concurring to establish the right of removal as vested by the Constitution in the President . To all these he added the weight of his own deliberate judgment , and advised me that it was my duty to defend the power of the President from usurpation and to veto the law . I do not know when a sense of public duty is more imperative upon a head of Department than upon such an occasion as this . He acts then under the gravest obligations of law , for when he is called upon by the President for advice it is the Constitution which speaks to him . All his other duties are left by the Constitution to be regulated by statute , but this duty was deemed so momentous that it is imposed by the Constitution itself . After all this I was not prepared for the ground taken by Stanton in his note of August 12 . I was not prepared to find him compelled by a new and indefinite sense of public duty , under the Constitution , to assume the vindication of a law which , under the solemn obligations of public duty imposed by the Constitution itself , he advised me was a violation of that Constitution . I make great allowance for a change of opinion , but such a change as this hardly falls within the limits of greatest indulgence . Where our opinions take the shape of advice , and influence the action of others , the utmost stretch of charity will scarcely justify us in repudiating them when they come to be applied to ourselves . But to proceed with the narrative . I was so much struck with the full mastery of the question manifested by Stanton , and was at the time so fully occupied with the preparation of another veto upon the pending reconstruction act , that I requested him to prepare the veto upon this tenure of office bill . This he declined , on the ground of physical disability to undergo at the time the labor of writing , but stated his readiness to furnish what aid might be required in the preparation of materials for the paper . At the time this subject was before the Cabinet it seemed to be taken for granted that as to those members of the Cabinet who had been appointed by Lincoln their tenure of office was not fixed by the provisions of the act . I do not remember that the point was distinctly decided , but I well recollect that it was suggested by one member of the Cabinet who was appointed by Lincoln , and that no dissent was expressed . Whether the point was well taken or not did not seem to me of any consequence , for the unanimous expression of opinion against the constitutionality and policy of the act was so decided that I felt no concern , so far as the act had reference to the gentlemen then present , that I would be embarrassed in the future . The bill had not then become a law . The limitation upon the power of removal was not yet imposed , and there was yet time to make any changes . If any one of these gentlemen had then said to me that he would avail himself of the provisions of that bill in case it became a law , I should not have hesitated a moment as to his removal . No pledge was then expressly given or required . But there are circumstances when to give an expressed pledge is not necessary , and when to require it is an imputation of possible bad faith . I felt that if these gentlemen came within the purview of the bill it was as to them a dead letter , and that none of them would ever take refuge under its provisions . I now pass to another subject . When , on the 15th of April , 1865 , the duties of the Presidential office devolved upon me , I found a full Cabinet of seven members , all of them selected by Lincoln . I made no change . On the contrary , I shortly afterwards ratified a change determined upon by Lincoln , but not perfected at his death , and admitted his appointee , Harlan , in the place of Usher , who was in office at the time . The great duty of the time was to reestablish government , law , and order in the insurrectionary States . Congress was then in recess , and the sudden overthrow of the rebellion required speedy action . This grave subject had engaged the attention of Lincoln in the last days of his life , and the plan according to which it was to be managed had been prepared and was ready for adoption . A leading feature of that plan was that it should be carried out by the Executive authority , for , so far as I have been informed , neither Lincoln nor any member of his Cabinet doubted his authority to act or proposed to call an extra session of Congress to do the work . The first business transacted in Cabinet after I became President was this unfinished business of my predecessor . A plan or scheme of reconstruction was produced which had been prepared for Lincoln by Stanton , his Secretary of War . It was approved , and at the earliest moment practicable was applied in the form of a proclamation to the State of North Carolina , and afterwards became the basis of action in turn for the other States . Upon the examination of Stanton before the Impeachment Committee he was asked the following question Did any one of the Cabinet express a doubt of the power of the executive branch of the Government to reorganize State governments which had been in rebellion without the aid of Congress He answered None whatever . I had myself entertained no doubt of the authority of the President to take measures for the organization of the rebel States on the plan proposed during the vacation of Congress and agreed in the plan specified in the proclamation in the case of North Carolina . There is perhaps no act of my Administration for which I have been more denounced than this . It was not originated by me , but I shrink from no responsibility on that account , for the plan approved itself to my own judgment , and I did not hesitate to carry it into execution . Thus far and upon this vital policy there was perfect accord between the Cabinet and myself , and I saw no necessity for a change . As time passed on there was developed an unfortunate difference of opinion and of policy between Congress and the President upon this same subject and upon the ultimate basis upon which the reconstruction of these States should proceed , especially upon the question of Negro suffrage . Upon this point three members of the Cabinet found themselves to be in sympathy with Congress . They remained only long enough to see that the difference of policy could not be reconciled . They felt that they should remain no longer , and a high sense of duty and propriety constrained them to resign their positions . We parted with mutual respect for the sincerity of each other in opposite opinions , and mutual regret that the difference was on points so vital as to require a severance of official relations . This was in the summer of 1866 . The subsequent sessions of Congress developed new complications , when the suffrage bill for the District of Columbia and the reconstruction acts of March 2 and March 23 , 1867 , all passed over the veto . It was in Cabinet consultations upon these bills that a difference of opinion upon the most vital points was developed . Upon these questions there was perfect accord between all the members of the Cabinet and myself , except Stanton . He stood alone , and the difference of opinion could not be reconciled . That unity of opinion which , upon great questions of public policy or administration , is so essential to the Executive was gone . I do not claim that a head of Department should have no other opinions than those of the President . He has the same right , in the conscientious discharge of duty , to entertain and express his own opinions as has the President . What I do claim is that the President is the responsible head of the Administration , and when the opinions of a head of Department are irreconcilably opposed to those of the President in grave matters of policy and administration there is but one result which can solve the difficulty , and that is a severance of the official relation . This in the past history of the Government has always been the rule , and it is a wise one , for such differences of opinion among its members must impair the efficiency of any Administration . I have now referred to the general grounds upon which the withdrawal of Stanton from my Administration seemed to me to be proper and necessary , but I can not omit to state a special ground , which , if it stood alone , would vindicate my action . The sanguinary riot which occurred in the city of New Orleans on the 30th of August , 1866 , justly aroused public indignation and public inquiry , not only as to those who were engaged in it , but as to those who , more or less remotely , might be held to responsibility for its occurrence . I need not remind the Senate of the effort made to fix that responsibility on the President . The charge was openly made , and again and again reiterated all through the land , that the President was warned in time , but refused to interfere . By telegrams from the lieutenant governor and attorney general of Louisiana , dated the 27th and 28th of August , I was advised that a body of delegates claiming to be a constitutional convention were about to assemble in New Orleans that the matter was before the grand jury , but that it would be impossible to execute civil process without a riot and this question was asked Is the military to interfere to prevent process of court This question was asked at a time when the civil courts were in the full exercise of their authority , and the answer sent by telegraph on the same 28th of August was this The military will be expected to sustain , and not to interfere with , the proceedings of the courts . On the same 28th of August the following telegram was sent to Stanton by Major General Baird , then owing to the absence of General Sheridan in command of the military at New Orleans EDWIN STANTON , Secretary of War A convention has been called , with the sanction of Governor Wells , to meet here on Monday . The lieutenant governor and city authorities think it unlawful , and propose to break it up by arresting the delegates . I have given no orders on the subject , but have warned the parties that I could not countenance or permit such action without instructions to that effect from the President . Please instruct me at once by telegraph . The 28th of August was on Saturday . The next morning , the 29th , this dispatch was received by Stanton at his residence in this city . He took no action upon it , and neither sent instructions to General Baird himself nor presented it to me for such instructions . On the next day Monday the riot occurred . I never saw this dispatch from General Baird until some ten days or two weeks after the riot , when , upon my call for all the dispatches , with a view to their publication , Stanton sent it to me . These facts all appear in the testimony of Stanton before the Judiciary Committee in the impeachment investigation . On the 30th , the day of the riot , and after it was suppressed , General Baird wrote to Stanton a long letter , from which I make the following extracts SII have the honor to inform you that a very serious riot has occurred here to day . I had not been applied to by the convention for protection , but the lieutenant governor and the mayor had freely consulted with me , and I was so fully convinced that it was so strongly the intent of the city authorities to preserve the peace , in order to prevent military interference , that I did not regard an outbreak as a thing to be apprehended . The lieutenant governor had assured me that even if a writ of arrest was issued by the court the sheriff would not attempt to serve it without my permission , and for to day they designed to suspend it . I inclose herewith copies of my correspondence with the mayor and of a dispatch which the lieutenant governor claims to have received from the President . I regret that no reply to my dispatch to you of Saturday has yet reached me . General Sheridan is still absent in Texas . The dispatch of General Baird of the 28th asks for immediate instructions , and his letter of the 30th , after detailing the terrible riot which had just happened , ends with the expression of regret that the instructions which he asked for were not sent . It is not the fault or the error or the omission of the President that this military commander was left without instructions but for all omissions , for all errors , for all failures to instruct when instruction might have averted this calamity , the President was openly and persistently held responsible . Instantly , without waiting for proof , the delinquency of the President was heralded in every form of utterance . Stanton knew then that the President was not responsible for this delinquency . The exculpation was in his power , but it was not given by him to the public , and only to the President in obedience to a requisition for all the dispatches . No one regrets more than myself that General Baird s request was not brought to my notice . It is clear from his dispatch and letter that if the Secretary of War had given him proper instructions the riot which arose on the assembling of the convention would have been averted . There may be those ready to say that I would have given no instructions even if the dispatch had reached me in time , but all must admit that I ought to have had the opportunity . The following is the testimony given by Stanton before the impeachment investigation committee as to this dispatch I received that dispatch on Sunday forenoon . I examined it carefully , and considered the question presented . I did not see that I could give any instructions different from the line of action which General Baird proposed , and made no answer to the dispatch . That is the date of its reception in the telegraph office Saturday night . I received it on Sunday forenoon at my residence . A copy of the dispatch was furnished to the President several days afterwards , along with all the other dispatches and communications on that subject , but it was not furnished by me before that time . I suppose it may have been ten or fifteen days afterwards . The President himself being in correspondence with those parties upon the same subject , would it not have been proper to have advised him of the reception of that dispatch I know nothing about his correspondence , and know nothing about any correspondence except this one dispatch . We had intelligence of the riot on Thursday morning . The riot had taken place on Monday . It is a difficult matter to define all the relations which exist between the heads of Departments and the President . The legal relations are well enough defined . The Constitution places these officers in the relation of his advisers when he calls upon them for advice . The acts of Congress go further . Take , for example , the act of 1789 creating the War Department . It provides that There shall be a principal officer therein to be called the Secretary for the Department of War , who shall perform and execute such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined on or intrusted to him by the President of the United States and , furthermore , the said principal officer shall conduct the business of the said Department in such manner as the President of the United States shall from time to time order and instruct . Provision is also made for the appointment of an inferior officer by the head of the Department , to be called the chief clerk , who , whenever said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States , shall have the charge and custody of the books , records , and papers of the Department . The legal relation is analogous to that of principal and agent . It is the President upon whom the Constitution devolves , as head of the executive department , the duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed but as he can not execute them in person , he is allowed to select his agents , and is made responsible for their acts within just limits . So complete is this presumed delegation of authority in the relation of a head of Department to the President that the Supreme Court of the United States have decided that an order made by a head of Department is presumed to be made by the President himself . The principal , upon whom such responsibility is placed for the acts of a subordinate , ought to be left as free as possible in the matter of selection and of dismissal . To hold him to responsibility for an officer beyond his control to leave the question of the fitness of such an agent to be decided for him and not by him to allow such a subordinate , when the President , moved by public considerations of a high character , requests his resignation , to assume for himself an equal right to act upon his own views of public considerations and to make his own conclusions paramount to those of the President to allow all this is to reverse the just order of administration and to place the subordinate above the superior . There are , however , other relations between the President and a head of Department beyond these defined legal relations , which necessarily attend them , though not expressed . Chief among these is mutual confidence . This relation is so delicate that it is sometimes hard to say when or how it ceases . A single flagrant act may end it at once , and then there is no difficulty . But confidence may be just as effectually destroyed by a series of causes too subtle for demonstration . As it is a plant of slow growth , so , too , it may be slow in decay . Such has been the process here . I will not pretend to say what acts or omissions have broken up this relation . They are hardly susceptible of statement , and still less of formal proof . Nevertheless , no one can read the correspondence of the 5th of August without being convinced that this relation was effectually gone on both sides , and that while the President was unwilling to allow Stanton to remain in his Administration , Stanton was equally unwilling to allow the President to carry on his Administration without his presence . In the great debate which took place in the House of Representatives in 1789 , in the first organization of the principal Departments , Madison spoke as follows It is evidently the intention of the Constitution that the first magistrate should be responsible for the executive department . So far , therefore , as we do not make the officers who are to aid him in the duties of that department responsible to him , he is not responsible to the country . Again Is there no danger that an officer , when he is appointed by the concurrence of the Senate and has friends in that body , may choose rather to risk his establishment on the favor of that branch than rest it upon the discharge of his duties to the satisfaction of the executive branch , which is constitutionally authorized to inspect and control his conduct And if it should happen that the officers connect themselves with the Senate , they may mutually support each other , and for want of efficacy reduce the power of the President to a vapor , in which case his responsibility would be annihilated , and the expectation of it is unjust . The high executive officers , joined in cabal with the Senate , would lay the foundation of discord , and end in an assumption of the executive power only to be removed by a revolution in the Government . Sedgwick , in the same debate , referring to the proposition that a head of Department should only be removed or suspended by the concurrence of the Senate , used this language But if proof be necessary , what is then the consequence Why , in nine cases out of ten , where the case is very dear to the mind of the President that the man ought to be removed , the effect can not be produced , because it is absolutely impossible to produce the necessary evidence . Are the Senate to proceed without evidence Some gentlemen contend not . Then the object will be lost . Shall a man under these circumstances be saddled upon the President who has been appointed for no other purpose but to aid the President in performing certain duties Shall he be continued , I ask again , against the will of the President If he is , where is the responsibility Are you to look for it in the President , who has no control over the officer , no power to remove him if he acts unfeelingly or unfaithfully Without you make him responsible you weaken and destroy the strength and beauty of your system . What is to be done in cases which can only be known from a long acquaintance with the conduct of an officer I had indulged the hope that upon the assembling of Congress Stanton would have ended this unpleasant complication according to his intimation given in his note of August 12 . The duty which I have felt myself called upon to perform was by no means agreeable , but I feel that I am not responsible for the controversy or for the consequences . Unpleasant as this necessary change in my Cabinet has been to me upon personal considerations , I have the consolation to be assured that so far as the public interests are involved there is no cause for regret . Salutary reforms have been introduced by the Secretary ad interim and great reductions of expenses have been effected under his administration of the War Department , to the saving of millions to the Treasury .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives I have considered the bill entitled An act supplementary to an act entitled An act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States , passed March 2 , 1867 , and to facilitate restoration and now return it to the House of Representatives with my objections . This bill provides for elections in the ten States brought under the operation of the original act to which it is supplementary . Its details are principally directed to the elections for the formation of the State constitutions , but by the sixth section of the bill all elections in these States occurring while the original act remains in force are brought within its purview . Referring to these details , it will be found that , first of all , there is to be a registration of the voters . No one whose name has not been admitted on the list is to be allowed to vote at any of these elections . To ascertain who is entitled to registration , reference is made necessary , by the express language of the supplement , to the original act and to the pending bill . The fifth section of the original act provides , as to voters , that they shall be male citizens of the State , 21 years old and upward , of whatever race , color , or previous condition , who have been residents of said State for one year . This is the general qualification , followed , however , by many exceptions . No one can be registered , according to the original act , who may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion a provision which left undetermined the question as to what amounted to disfranchisement , and whether without a judicial sentence the act itself produced that effect . This supplemental bill superadds an oath , to be taken by every person before his name can be admitted upon the registration , that he has not been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or civil war against the United States . It thus imposes upon every person the necessity and responsibility of deciding for himself , under the peril of punishment by a military commission if he makes a mistake , what works disfranchisement by participation in rebellion and what amounts to such participation . Almost every man the Negro as well as the white above 21 years of age who was resident in these ten States during the rebellion , voluntarily or involuntarily , at some time and in some way did participate in resistance to the lawful authority of the General Government . The question with the citizen to whom this oath is to be proposed must be a fearful one , for while the bill does not declare that perjury may be assigned for such false swearing nor fix any penalty for the offense , we must not forget that martial law prevails that every person is answerable to a military commission , without previous presentment by a grand jury , for any charge that may be made against him , and that the supreme authority of the military commander determines the question as to what is an offense and what is to be the measure of punishment . The fourth section of the bill provides that the commanding general of each district shall appoint as many boards of registration as may be necessary , consisting of three loyal officers or persons . The only qualification stated for these officers is that they must be loyal . They may be persons in the military service or civilians , residents of the State or strangers . Yet these persons are to exercise most important duties and are vested with unlimited discretion . They are to decide what names shall be placed upon the register and from their decision there is to be no appeal . They are to superintend the elections and to decide all questions which may arise . They are to have the custody of the ballots and to make return of the persons elected . Whatever frauds or errors they may commit must pass without redress . All that is left for the commanding general is to receive the returns of the elections , open the same , and ascertain who are chosen according to the returns of the officers who conducted said elections . By such means and with this sort of agency are the conventions of delegates to be constituted . As the delegates are to speak for the people , common justice would seem to require that they should have authority from the people themselves . No convention so constituted will in any sense represent the wishes of the inhabitants of these States , for under the all embracing exceptions of these laws , by a construction which the uncertainty of the clause as to disfranchisement leaves open to the board of officers , the great body of the people may be excluded from the polls and from all opportunity of expressing their own wishes or voting for delegates who will faithfully reflect their sentiments . I do not deem it necessary further to investigate the details of this bill . No consideration could induce me to give my approval to such an election law for any purpose , and especially for the great purpose of framing the constitution of a State . If ever the American citizen should be left to the free exercise of his own judgment it is when he is engaged in the work of forming the fundamental law under which he is to live . That work is his work , and it can not properly be taken out of his hands . All this legislation proceeds upon the contrary assumption that the people of each of these States shall have no constitution except such as may be arbitrarily dictated by Congress and formed under the restraint of military rule . A plain statement of facts makes this evident . In all these States there are existing constitutions , framed in the accustomed way by the people . Congress , however , declares that these constitutions are not loyal and republican , and requires the people to form them anew . What , then , in the opinion of Congress , is necessary to make the constitution of a State loyal and republican The original act answers the question It is universal Negro suffrage a question which the Federal Constitution leaves exclusively to the States themselves . All this legislative machinery of martial law , military coercion , and political disfranchisement is avowedly for that purpose and none other . The existing constitutions of the ten States conform to the acknowledged standards of loyalty and republicanism . Indeed , if there are degrees in republican forms of government , their constitutions are more republican now than when these States , four of which were members of the original thirteen , first became members of the Union . Congress does not now demand that a single provision of their constitutions be changed except such as confine suffrage to the white population . It is apparent , therefore , that these provisions do not conform to the standard of republicanism which Congress seeks to establish . That there may be no mistake , it is only necessary that reference should be made to the original act , which declares such constitution shall provide that the elective franchise shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have the qualifications herein stated for electors of delegates . What class of persons is here meant clearly appears in the same section that is to say , the male citizens of said State 21 years old and upward , of whatever race , color , or previous condition , who have been resident in said State for one year previous to the day of such election . Without these provisions no constitution which can be framed in any one of the ten States will be of any avail with Congress . This , then , is the test of what the constitution of a State of this Union must contain to make it republican . Measured by such a standard , how few of the States now composing the Union have republican constitutions If in the exercise of the constitutional guaranty that Congress shall secure to every State a republican form of government universal suffrage for blacks as well as whites is a sine qua non , the work of reconstruction may as well begin in Ohio as in Virginia , in Pennsylvania as in North Carolina . When I contemplate the millions of our fellow citizens of the South with no alternative left but to impose upon themselves this fearful and untried experiment of complete Negro enfranchisement and white disfranchisement , it may be , almost as complete or submit indefinitely to the rigor of martial law , without a single attribute of freemen , deprived of all the sacred guaranties of our Federal Constitution , and threatened with even worse wrongs , if any worse are possible , it seems to me their condition is the most deplorable to which any people can be reduced . It is true that they have been engaged in rebellion and that their object being a separation of the States and a dissolution of the Union there was an obligation resting upon every loyal citizen to treat them as enemies and to wage war against their cause . Inflexibly opposed to any movement imperiling the integrity of the Government , I did not hesitate to urge the adoption of all measures necessary for the suppression of the insurrection . After a long and terrible struggle the efforts of the Government were triumphantly successful , and the people of the South , submitting to the stern arbitrament , yielded forever the issues of the contest . Hostilities terminated soon after it became my duty to assume the responsibilities of the chief executive officer of the Republic , and I at once endeavored to repress and control the passions which our civil strife had engendered , and , no longer regarding these erring millions as enemies , again acknowledged them as our friends and our countrymen . The war had accomplished its objects . The nation was saved and that seminal principle of mischief which from the birth of the Government had gradually but inevitably brought on the rebellion was totally eradicated . Then , it seemed to me , was the auspicious time to commence the work of reconciliation then , when these people sought once more our friendship and protection , I considered it our duty generously to meet them in the spirit of charity and forgiveness and to conquer them even more effectually by the magnanimity of the nation than by the force of its arms . I yet believe that if the policy of reconciliation then inaugurated , and which contemplated an early restoration of these people to all their political rights , had received the support of Congress , every one of these ten States and all their people would at this moment be fast anchored in the Union and the great work which gave the war all its sanction and made it just and holy would have been accomplished . Then over all the vast and fruitful regions of the South peace and its blessings would have prevailed , while now millions are deprived of rights guaranteed by the Constitution to every citizen and after nearly two years of legislation find themselves placed under an absolute military despotism . A military republic , a government rounded on mock elections and supported only by the sword , was nearly a quarter of a century since pronounced by Daniel Webster , when speaking of the South American States , as a movement , indeed , but a retrograde and disastrous movement , from the regular and old fashioned monarchical systems and he added If men would enjoy the blessings of republican government , they must govern themselves by reason , by mutual counsel and consultation , by a sense and feeling of general interest , and by the acquiescence of the minority in the will of the majority , properly expressed and , above all , the military must be kept , according to the language of our bill of rights , in strict subordination to the civil authority . Wherever this lesson is not both learned and practiced there can be no political freedom . Absurd , preposterous is it , a scoff and a satire on free forms of constitutional liberty , for frames of government to be prescribed by military leaders and the right of suffrage to be exercised at the point of the sword . I confidently believe that a time will come when these States will again occupy their true positions in the Union . The barriers which now seem so obstinate must yield to the force of an enlightened and just public opinion , and sooner or later unconstitutional and oppressive legislation will be effaced from our statute books . When this shall have been consummated , I pray God that the errors of the past may be forgotten and that once more we shall be a happy , united , and prosperous people , and that at last , after the bitter and eventful experience through which the nation has passed , we shall all come to know that our only safety is in the preservation of our Federal Constitution and in according to every American citizen and to every State the rights which that Constitution secures .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives The following Joint resolution , restoring Tennessee to her relations in the Union , was last evening presented for my approval Whereas in the year 1861 the government of the State of Tennessee was seized upon and taken possession of by persons in hostility to the United States , and the inhabitants of said State , in pursuance of an act of Congress , were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the United States and Whereas said State government can only be restored to its former political relations in the Union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the United States and Whereas the people of said State did , on the 22d day of February , 1865 , by a large popular vote , adopt and ratify a constitution of government whereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared void and Whereas a State government has been organized under said constitution which has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery , also the amendment proposed by the Thirty ninth Congress , and has done other acts proclaiming and denoting loyalty Therefore , Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled , That the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical relations to the Union , and is again entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives in Congress . The preamble simply consists of statements , some of which are assumed , while the resolution is merely a declaration of opinion . It comprises no legislation , nor does it confer any power which is binding upon the respective Houses , the Executive , or the States . It does not admit to their seats in Congress the Senators and Representatives from the State of Tennessee , for , notwithstanding the passage of the resolution , each House , in the exercise of the constitutional right to judge for itself of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its members , may , at its discretion , admit them or continue to exclude them . If a joint resolution of this kind were necessary and binding as a condition precedent to the admission of members of Congress , it would happen , in the event of a veto by the Executive , that Senators and Representatives could only be admitted to the halls of legislation by a two thirds vote of each of the Houses . Among other reasons recited in the preamble for the declaration contained in the resolution is the ratification by the State government of Tennessee of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery , also the amendment proposed by the Thirty ninth Congress . if , as is also declared in the preamble , said State government can only be restored to its former political relations in the Union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the United States , it would really seem to follow that the joint resolution which at this late day has received the sanction of Congress should have been passed , approved , and placed on the statute books before any amendment to the Constitution was submitted to the legislature of Tennessee for ratification . Otherwise the inference is plainly deducible that while , in the opinion of Congress , the people of a State may be too strongly disloyal to be entitled to representation , they may nevertheless , during the suspension of their former proper practical relations to the Union , have an equally potent voice with other and loyal States in propositions to amend the Constitution , upon which so essentially depend the stability , prosperity , and very , existence of the nation . A brief reference to my annual message of the 4th of December last will show the steps taken by the Executive for the restoration to their constitutional relations to the Union of the States that had been affected by the rebellion . Upon the cessation of active hostilities provisional governors were appointed , conventions called , governors elected by the people , legislatures assembled , and Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United States . At the same time the courts of the United States were reopened , the blockade removed , the custom houses reestablished , and postal operations resumed . The amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery forever within the limits of the country was also submitted to the States , and they were thus invited to and did participate in its ratification , thus exercising the highest functions pertaining to a State . In addition nearly all of these States , through their conventions and legislatures , had adopted and ratified constitutions of government whereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared void . So far , then , the political existence of the States and their relations to the Federal Government had been fully and completely recognized and acknowledged by the executive department of the Government and the completion of the work of restoration , which had progressed so favorably , was submitted to Congress , upon which devolved all questions pertaining to the admission to their seats of the Senators and Representatives chosen from the States whose people had engaged in the rebellion . All these steps had been taken when , on the 4th day of December , 1865 , the Thirty ninth Congress assembled . Nearly eight months have elapsed since that time and no other plan of restoration having been proposed by Congress for the measures instituted by the Executive , it is now declared , in the joint resolution submitted for my approval , that the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical relations to the Union , and is again entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives in Congress . Thus , after the lapse of nearly eight months , Congress proposes to pave the way to the admission to representation of one of the eleven States whose people arrayed themselves in rebellion against the constitutional authority of the Federal Government . Earnestly desiring to remove every cause of further delay , whether real or imaginary , on the part of Congress to the admission to seats of loyal Senators and Representatives from the State of Tennessee , I have , notwithstanding the anomalous character of this proceeding , affixed my signature to the resolution . My approval , however , is not to be construed as an acknowledgment of the right of Congress to pass laws preliminary to the admission of duly qualified Representatives from any of the States . Neither is it to be considered as committing me to all the statements made in the preamble , some of which are , in my opinion , without foundation in fact , especially the assertion that the State of Tennessee has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposed by the Thirty ninth Congress . No official notice of such ratification has been received by the Executive or filed in the Department of State on the contrary , unofficial information from the most reliable sources induces the belief that the amendment has not yet been constitutionally sanctioned by the legislature of Tennessee . The right of each House under the Constitution to judge of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members is undoubted , and my approval or disapproval of the resolution could not in the slightest degree increase or diminish the authority in this respect conferred upon the two branches of Congress . In conclusion I can not too earnestly repeat my recommendation for the admission of Tennessee , and all other States , to a fair and equal participation in national legislation when they present themselves in the persons of loyal Senators and Representatives who can comply with all the requirements of the Constitution and the laws . By this means harmony and reconciliation will be effected , the practical relations of all the States to the Federal Government reestablished , and the work of restoration , inaugurated upon the termination of the war , successfully completed .<speech_sep>Whereas the President of the United States , on the 8th day of December , 1863 , and on the 26th day of March , 1864 , did , with the object to suppress the existing rebellion , to induce all persons to return to their loyalty , and to restore the authority of the United States , issue proclamations offering amnesty and pardon to certain persons who had , directly or by implication , participated in the said rebellion and Whereas many persons who had so engaged in said rebellion have , since the issuance of said proclamations , failed or neglected to take the benefits offered thereby and Whereas many persons who have been justly deprived of all claim to amnesty and pardon thereunder by reason of their participation , directly or by implication , in said rebellion and continued hostility to the Government of the United States since the date of said proclamations now desire to apply for and obtain amnesty and pardon . To the end , therefore , that the authority of the Government of the United States may be restored and that peace , order , and freedom may be established , Andrew Johnson , President of the United States , do proclaim and declare that I hereby grant to all persons who have , directly or indirectly , participated in the existing rebellion , except as hereinafter excepted , amnesty and pardon , with restoration of all rights of property , except as to slaves and except in cases where legal proceedings under the laws of the United States providing for the confiscation of property of persons engaged in rebellion have been instituted but upon the condition , nevertheless , that every such person shall take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate , and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor and effect following , to wit I , _________ , do solemnly swear or affirm , in presence of Almighty God , that I will henceforth faithfully support , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States thereunder , and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which have been made during the existing rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves . So help me God . The following classes of persons are excepted from the benefits of this proclamation First .

Done at the city of Washington , the 29th day of May , 1865 , and of the Independence of the United States the eighty ninth . ANDREW JOHNSON . By the President WILLIAM SEWARD , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Upon the reassembling of Congress it again becomes my duty to call your attention to the state of the Union and to its continued disorganized condition under the various laws which have been passed upon the subject of reconstruction . It may be safely assumed as an axiom in the government of states that the greatest wrongs inflicted upon a people are caused by unjust and arbitrary legislation , or by the unrelenting decrees of despotic rulers , and that the timely revocation of injurious and oppressive measures is the greatest good that can be conferred upon a nation . The legislator or ruler who has the wisdom and magnanimity to retrace his steps when convinced of error will sooner or later be rewarded with the respect and gratitude of an intelligent and patriotic people . Our own history , although embracing a period less than a century , affords abundant proof that most , if not all , of our domestic troubles are directly traceable to violations of the organic law and excessive legislation . The most striking illustrations of this fact are furnished by the enactments of the past three years upon the question of reconstruction . After a fair trial they have substantially failed and proved pernicious in their results , and there seems to be no good reason why they should longer remain upon the statute book . States to which the Constitution guarantees a republican form of government have been reduced to military dependencies in each of which the people have been made subject to the arbitrary will of the commanding general . Although the Constitution requires that each State shall be represented in Congress , Virginia , Mississippi , and Texas are yet excluded from the two Houses , and , contrary to the express provisions of that instrument were denied participation in the recent election for a President and Vice President of the United States . The attempt to place the white population under the domination of persons of color in the South has impaired , if not destroyed , the kindly relations that had previously existed between them and mutual distrust has engendered a feeling of animosity which leading in some instances to collision and bloodshed , has prevented that cooperation between the two races so essential to the success of industrial enterprise in the Southern States . Nor have the inhabitants of those States alone suffered from the disturbed condition of affairs growing out of these Congressional enactments . The entire Union has been agitated by grave apprehensions of troubles which might again involve the peace of the nation its interests have been injuriously affected by the derangement of business and labor , and the consequent want of prosperity throughout that portion of the country . The Federal Constitution the magna charta of American rights , under whose wise and salutary provisions we have successfully conducted all our domestic and foreign affairs , sustained ourselves in peace and in war , and become a great nation among the powers of the earth must assuredly be now adequate to the settlement of questions growing out of the civil war , waged alone for its vindication . This great fact is made most manifest by the condition of the country when Congress assembled in the month of December , 1865 . Civil strife had ceased , the spirit of rebellion had spent its entire force , in the Southern States the people had warmed into national life , and throughout the whole country a healthy reaction in public sentiment had taken place . By the application of the simple yet effective provisions of the Constitution the executive department , with the voluntary aid of the States , had brought the work of restoration as near completion as was within the scope of its authority , and the nation was encouraged by the prospect of an early and satisfactory adjustment of all its difficulties . Congress , however , intervened , and , refusing to perfect the work so nearly consummated , declined to admit members from the unrepresented States , adopted a series of measures which arrested the progress of restoration , frustrated all that had been so successfully accomplished , and , after three years of agitation and strife , has left the country further from the attainment of union and fraternal feeling than at the inception of the Congressional plan of reconstruction . It needs no argument to show that legislation which has produced such baneful consequences should be abrogated , or else made to conform to the genuine principles of republican government . Under the influence of party passion and sectional prejudice , other acts have been passed not warranted by the Constitution . Congress has already been made familiar with my views respecting the tenure of office bill . Experience has proved that its repeal is demanded by the best interests of the country , and that while it remains in force the President can not enjoin that rigid accountability of public officers so essential to an honest and efficient execution of the laws . Its revocation would enable the executive department to exercise the power of appointment and removal in accordance with the original design of the Federal Constitution . The act of March 2 , 1867 , making appropriations for the support of the Army for the year ending June 30 , 1868 , and for other purposes , contains provisions which interfere with the President s constitutional functions as Commander in Chief of the Army and deny to States of the Union the right to protect themselves by means of their own militia . These provisions should be at once annulled for while the first might , in times of great emergency , seriously embarrass the Executive in efforts to employ and direct the common strength of the nation for its protection and preservation , the other is contrary to the express declaration of the Constitution that a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . It is believed that the repeal of all such laws would be accepted by the American people as at least a partial return to the fundamental principles of the Government , and an indication that hereafter the Constitution is to be made the nation s safe and unerring guide . They can be productive of no permanent benefit to the country , and should not be permitted to stand as so many monuments of the deficient wisdom which has characterized our recent legislation . The condition of our finances demands the early and earnest consideration of Congress . Compared with the growth of our population , the public expenditures have reached an amount unprecedented in our history . The population of the United States in 1790 was nearly 4 , 000 , 000 people . Increasing each decade about 33 per cent , it reached in 1860 31 , 000 , 000 , an increase of 700 per cent on the population in 1790 . In 1869 it is estimated that it will reach 38 , 000 , 000 , or an increase of 868 per cent in seventy nine years . The annual expenditures of the Federal Government in 1791 were 4 , 200 , 000 in 1820 , 18 . 200 , 000 in 1850 , forty one millions in 1860 , sixty three millions in 1865 , nearly thirteen hundred millions and in 1869 it is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury , in his last annual report , that they will be three hundred and seventy two millions . By comparing the public disbursements of 1869 , as estimated , with those of 1791 , it will be seen that the increase of expenditure since the beginning of the Government has been 8 , 618 per cent , while the increase of the population for the same period was only 868 per cent . Again , the expenses of the Government in 1860 , the year of peace immediately preceding the war , were only sixty three millions , while in 1869 , the year of peace three years after the war it is estimated they will be three hundred and seventy two millions , an increase of 489 per cent , while the increase of population was only 21 per cent for the same period . These statistics further show that in 1791 the annual national expenses , compared with the population , were little more than 1 per capita , and in 1860 but 2 per capita while in 1869 they will reach the extravagant sum of 9 . 78 per capita . It will be observed that all these statements refer to and exhibit the disbursements of peace periods . It may , therefore , be of interest to compare the expenditures of the three war periods the war with Great Britain , the Mexican War , and the War of the Rebellion . In 1814 the annual expenses incident to the War of 1812 reached their highest amount about thirty one millions while our population slightly exceeded 8 , 000 , 000 , showing an expenditure of only 3 . 80 per capita . In 1847 the expenditures growing out of the war with Mexico reached fifty five millions , and the population about 21 , 000 , 000 , giving only 2 . 60 per capita for the war expenses of that year . In 1865 the expenditures called for by the rebellion reached the vast amount of twelve hundred and ninety millions , which , compared with a population of 34 , 000 , 000 , gives 38 . 20 per capita . From the 4th day of March , 1789 , to the 30th of June , 1861 , the entire expenditures of the Government were 1 , 700 , 000 , 000 . During that period we were engaged in wars with Great Britain and Mexico , and were involved in hostilities with powerful Indian tribes Louisiana was purchased from France at a cost of 15 , 000 , 000 Florida was ceded to us by Spain for five millions California was acquired from Mexico for fifteen millions , and the territory of New Mexico was obtained from Texas for the sum of ten millions . Early in 1861 the War of the Rebellion commenced and from the 1st of July of that year to the 30th of June , 1865 , the public expenditures reached the enormous aggregate of thirty three hundred millions . Three years of peace have intervened , and during that time the disbursements of the Government have successively been five hundred and twenty millions , three hundred and forty six millions , and three hundred and ninety three millions . Adding to these amounts three hundred and seventy two millions , estimated as necessary for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June , 1869 , we obtain a total expenditure of 1 , 600 , 000 , 000 during the four years immediately succeeding the war , or nearly as much as was expended during the seventy two years that preceded the rebellion and embraced the extraordinary expenditures already named . These startling facts clearly illustrate the necessity of retrenchment in all branches of the public service . Abuses which were tolerated during the war for the preservation of the nation will not be endured by the people , now that profound peace prevails . The receipts from internal revenues and customs have during the past three years gradually diminished , and the continuance of useless and extravagant expenditures will involve us in national bankruptcy , or else make inevitable an increase of taxes , already too onerous and in many respects obnoxious on account of their inquisitorial character . One hundred millions annually are expended for the military force , a large portion of which is employed in the execution of laws both unnecessary and unconstitutional one hundred and fifty millions are required each year to pay the interest on the public debt an army of taxgatherers impoverishes the nation , and public agents , placed by Congress beyond the control of the Executive , divert from their legitimate purposes large sums of money which they collect from the people in the name of the Government . Judicious legislation and prudent economy can alone remedy defects and avert evils which , if suffered to exist , can not fail to diminish confidence in the public councils and weaken the attachment and respect of the people toward their political institutions . Without proper care the small balance which it is estimated will remain in the Treasury at the close of the present fiscal year will not be realized , and additional millions be added to a debt which is now enumerated by billions . It is shown by the able and comprehensive report of the Secretary of the Treasury that the receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1868 , were 405 , 638 , 083 , and that the expenditures for the same period were 377 , 340 , 284 , leaving in the Treasury a surplus of 28 , 297 , 798 . It is estimated that the receipts during the present fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1869 , will be 341 , 392 , 868 and the expenditures 336 , 152 , 470 , showing a small balance of 5 , 240 , 398 in favor of the Government . For the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1870 , it is estimated that the receipts will amount to 327 , 000 , 000 and the expenditures to 303 , 000 , 000 , leaving an estimated surplus of 24 , 000 , 000 . It becomes proper in this connection to make a brief reference to our public indebtedness , which has accumulated with such alarming rapidity and assumed such colossal proportions . In 1789 , when the Government commenced operations under the Federal Constitution , it was burdened with an indebtedness of 75 , 000 , 000 , created during the War of the Revolution . This amount had been reduced to 45 , 000 , 000 when , in 1812 , war was declared against Great Britain . The three years struggle that followed largely increased the national obligations , and in 1816 they had attained the sum of 127 , 000 , 000 . Wise and economical legislation , however , enabled the Government to pay the entire amount within a period of twenty years , and the extinguishment of the national debt filled the land with rejoicing and was one of the great events of President Jackson s Administration . After its redemption a large fund remained in the Treasury , which was deposited for safe keeping with the several States . on condition that it should be returned when required by the public wants . In 1849 the year after the termination of an expensive war with Mexico we found ourselves involved in a debt of 64 , 000 , 000 and this was the amount owed by the Government in 1860 , just prior to the outbreak of the rebellion . In the spring of 1861 our civil war commenced . Each year of its continuance made an enormous addition to the debt and when . in the spring of 1865 , the nation successfully emerged from the conflict , the obligations of the Government had reached the immense sum of 2 . 873 , 992 , 909 . The Secretary of the Treasury shows that on the 1st day of November , 1867 , this amount had been reduced to 2 , 491 , 504 , 450 but at the same time his report exhibits an increase during the past year of 35 , 625 , 102 , for the debt on the 1st day of November last is stated to have been 2 , 527 , 129 , 552 . It is estimated by the Secretary that the returns for the past month will add to our liabilities the further sum of 11 , 000 , 000 , making a total increase during thirteen months of 46 , 500 , 000 . In my message to Congress December 4 , 1865 , it was suggested that a policy should be devised which , without being oppressive to the people , would at once begin to effect a reduction of the debt , and , if persisted in , discharge it fully within a definite number of years . The Secretary of the Treasury forcibly recommends legislation of this character , and justly urges that the longer it is deferred the more difficult must become its accomplishment . We should follow the wise precedents established in 1789 and 1816 , and without further delay make provision for the payment of our obligations at as early a period as may be practicable . The fruits of their labors should be enjoyed by our citizens rather than used to build up and sustain moneyed monopolies in our own and other lands . Our foreign debt is already computed by the Secretary of the Treasury at 850 , 000 , 000 citizens of foreign countries receive interest upon a large portion of our securities , and American taxpayers are made to contribute large sums for their support . The idea that such a debt is to become permanent should be at all times discarded as involving taxation too heavy to be borne . and payment once in every sixteen years , at the present rate of interest , of an amount equal to the original sum . This vast debt , if permitted to become permanent and increasing , must eventually be gathered into the hands of a few , and enable them to exert a dangerous and controlling power in the affairs of the Government . The borrowers would become servants to the lenders , the lenders the masters of the people . We now pride ourselves upon having given freedom to 4 , 000 , 000 of the colored race it will then be our shame that 40 , 000 , 000 of people , by their own toleration of usurpation and profligacy , have suffered themselves to become enslaved , and merely exchanged slave owners for new taskmasters in the shape of bondholders and taxgatherers . Besides , permanent debts pertain to monarchical governments , and , tending to monopolies , perpetuities , and class legislation , are totally irreconcilable with free institutions . Introduced into our republican system , they would gradually but surely sap its foundations , eventually subvert our governmental fabric , and erect upon its ruins a moneyed aristocracy . It is our sacred duty to transmit unimpaired to our posterity the blessings of liberty which were bequeathed to us by the founders of the Republic , and by our example teach those who are to follow us carefully to avoid the dangers which threaten a free and independent people . Various plans have been proposed for the payment of the public debt . However they may have varied as to the time and mode in which it should be redeemed , there seems to be a general concurrence as to the propriety and justness of a reduction in the present rate of interest . The Secretary of the Treasury in his report recommends 5 per cent Congress , in a bill passed prior to adjournment on the 27th of July last , agreed upon 4 and 4 1 2 per cent while by many 3 per cent has been held to be an amply sufficient return for the investment . The general impression as to the exorbitancy of the existing rate of interest has led to an inquiry in the public mind respecting the consideration which the Government has actually received for its bonds , and the conclusion is becoming prevalent that the amount which it obtained was in real money three or four hundred per cent less than the obligations which it issued in return . It can not be denied that we are paying an extravagant percentage for the use of the money borrowed , which was paper currency , greatly depreciated below the value of coin . This fact is made apparent when we consider that bondholders receive from the Treasury upon each dollar they own in Government securities 6 per cent in gold , which is nearly or quite equal to 9 per cent in currency that the bonds are then converted into capital for the national banks , upon which those institutions issue their circulation , bearing 6 per cent interest and that they are exempt from taxation by the Government and the States , and thereby enhanced 2 per cent in the hands of the holders . We thus have an aggregate of 17 per cent which may be received upon each dollar by the owners of Government securities . A system that produces such results is justly regarded as favoring a few at the expense of the many , and has led to the further inquiry whether our bondholders , in view of the large profits which they have enjoyed , would themselves be averse to a settlement of our indebtedness upon a plan which would yield them a fair remuneration and at the same time be just to the taxpayers of the nation . Our national credit should be sacredly observed , but in making provision for our creditors we should not forget what is due to the masses of the people . It may be assumed that the holders of our securities have already received upon their bonds a larger amount than their original investment , measured by a gold standard . Upon this statement of facts it would seem but just and equitable that the 6 per cent interest now paid by the Government should be applied to the reduction of the principal in semiannual installments , which in sixteen years and eight months would liquidate the entire national debt . Six per cent in gold would at present rates be equal to 9 per cent in currency , and equivalent to the payment of the debt one and a half times in a fraction less than seventeen years . This , in connection with all the other advantages derived from their investment , would afford to the public creditors a fair and liberal compensation for the use of their capital , and with this they should be satisfied . The lessons of the past admonish the lender that it is not well to be over anxious in exacting from the borrower rigid compliance with the letter of the bond . If provision be made for the payment of the indebtedness of the Government in the manner suggested , our nation will rapidly recover its wonted prosperity . Its interests require that some measure should be taken to release the large amount of capital invested in the securities of the Government . It is not now merely unproductive , but in taxation annually consumes 150 , 000 , 000 , which would otherwise be used by our enterprising people in adding to the wealth of the nation . Our commerce , which at one time successfully rivaled that of the great maritime powers , has rapidly diminished , and our industrial interests are in a depressed and languishing condition . The development of our inexhaustible resources is checked , and the fertile fields of the South are becoming waste for want of means to till them . With the release of capital , new life would be infused into the paralyzed energies of our people and activity and vigor imparted to every branch of industry . Our people need encouragement in their efforts to recover from the effects of the rebellion and of injudicious legislation , and it should be the aim of the Government to stimulate them by the prospect of an early release from the burdens which impede their prosperity . If we can not take the burdens from their shoulders , we should at least manifest a willingness to help to bear them . In referring to the condition of the circulating medium , I shall merely reiterate substantially that portion of my last annual message which relates to that subject . The proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a question upon which political economists have not agreed . Nor can it be controlled by legislation , but must be left to the irrevocable laws which everywhere regulate commerce and trade . The circulating medium will ever irresistibly flow to those points where it is in greatest demand . The law of demand and supply is as unerring as that which regulates the tides of the ocean and , indeed , currency , like the tides , has its ebbs and flows throughout the commercial world . At the beginning of the rebellion the bank note circulation of the country amounted to not much more than 200 , 000 , 000 now the circulation of national bank notes and those known as legal tenders is nearly seven hundred millions . While it is urged by some that this amount should be increased , others contend that a decided reduction is absolutely essential to the best interests of the country . In view of these diverse opinions , it may be well to ascertain the real value of our paper issues when compared with a metallic or convertible currency . For this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be purchased by the seven hundred millions of paper money now in circulation . Probably not more than half the amount of the latter showing that when our paper currency is compared with gold and silver its commercial value is compressed into three hundred and fifty millions . This striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the Government , as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound political economy , to take such measures as will enable the holders of its notes and those of the national banks to convert them , without loss , into specie or its equivalent . A reduction of our paper circulating medium need not necessarily follow . This , however , would depend upon the law of demand and supply , though it should be borne in mind that by making legal tender and bank notes convertible into coin or its equivalent their present specie value in the hands of their holders would be enhanced 100 per cent . Legislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded by the highest public considerations . The Constitution contemplates that the circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and value . At the time of the formation of that instrument the country had just emerged from the War of the Revolution , and was suffering from the effects of a redundant and worthless paper currency . The sages of that period were anxious to protect their posterity from the evils which they themselves had experienced . Hence in providing a circulating medium they conferred upon Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof , at the same time prohibiting the States from making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts . The anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with that which was originally designed . Our circulation now embraces , first , notes of the national banks , which are made receivable for all dues to the Government , excluding imposts , and by all its creditors , excepting in payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves second , legal tender , issued by the United States , and which the law requires shall be received as well in payment of all debts between citizens as of all Government dues , excepting imposts and , third , gold and silver coin . By the operation of our present system of finance however , the metallic currency , when collected , is reserved only for one class of Government creditors , who , holding its bonds , semiannually receive their interest in coin from the National Treasury . There is no reason which will be accepted as satisfactory by the people why those who defend us on the land and protect us on the sea the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation , bearing the scars and wounds received while in its service the public servants in the various departments of the Government the farmer who supplies the soldiers of the Army and the sailors of the Navy the artisan who toils in the nation s workshops , or the mechanics and laborers who build its edifices and construct its forts and vessels of war , should , in payment of their just and hard earned dues , receive depreciated paper , while another class of their countrymen , no more deserving are paid in coin of gold and silver . Equal and exact justice requires that all the creditors of the Government should be paid in a currency possessing a uniform value . This can only be accomplished by the restoration of the currency to the standard established by the Constitution , and by this means we would remove a discrimination which may , if it has not already done so , create a prejudice that may become deep rooted and widespread and imperil the national credit . The feasibility of making our currency correspond with the constitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived from our commercial statistics . The aggregate product of precious metals in the United States from 1849 to 1867 amounted to 1 , 174 , 000 , 000 , while for the same period the net exports of specie were 741 , 000 , 000 . This shows an excess of product over net exports of 433 , 000 , 000 . There are in the Treasury 103 , 407 , 985 in coin in circulation in the States on the Pacific Coast about 40 , 000 , 000 , and a few millions in the national and other banks in all less than 160 , 000 , 000 . Taking into consideration the specie in the country prior to 1849 and that produced since 1867 , and we have more than 300 , 000 , 000 not accounted for by exportation or by returns of the Treasury , and therefore most probably remaining in the country . These are important facts , and show how completely the inferior currency will supersede the better , forcing it from circulation among the masses and causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade , to add to the money capital of foreign lands . They show the necessity of retiring our paper money , that the return of gold and silver to the avenues of trade may be invited and a demand created which will cause the retention at home of at least so much of the productions of our rich and inexhaustible gold bearing fields as may be sufficient for purposes of circulation . It is unreasonable to expect a return to a sound currency so long as the Government and banks , by continuing to issue irredeemable notes , fill the channels of circulation with depreciated paper . Notwithstanding a coinage by our mints since 1849 of 874 , 000 , 000 , the people are now strangers to the currency which was designed for their use and benefit , and specimens of the precious metals bearing the national device are seldom seen , except when produced to gratify the interest excited by their novelty . If depreciated paper is to be continued as the permanent currency of the country , and all our coin is to become a mere article of traffic and speculation , to the enhancement in price of all that is indispensable to the comfort of the people , it would be wise economy to abolish our mints , thus saving the nation the care and expense incident to such establishments , and let our precious metals be exported in bullion . The time has come , however , when the Government and national banks should be required to take the most efficient steps and make all necessary arrangements for a resumption of specie payments . Let specie payments once be earnestly inaugurated by the Government and banks , and the value of the paper circulation would directly approximate a specie standard . Specie payments having been resumed by the Government and banks , all notes or bills of paper issued by either of a less denomination than 20 should by law be excluded from circulation , so that the people may have the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency which in all their business transactions will be uniform in value at home and abroad . Every man of property or industry , every man who desires to preserve what he honestly possesses or to obtain what he can honestly earn , has a direct interest in maintaining a safe circulating medium such a medium as shall be real and substantial , not liable to vibrate with opinions , not subject to be blown up or blown down by the breath of speculation , but to be made stable and secure . A disordered currency is one of the greatest political evils . It undermines the virtues necessary for the support of the social system and encourages propensities destructive of its happiness it wars against industry , frugality , and economy , and it fosters the evil spirits of extravagance and speculation . It has been asserted by one of our profound and most gifted statesmen that Of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind , none has been more effectual than that which deludes them with paper money . This is the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich man s fields by the sweat of the poor man s brow . Ordinary tyranny , oppression , excessive taxation these bear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community compared with a fraudulent currency and the robberies committed by depreciated paper . Our own history has recorded for our instruction enough , and more than enough , of the demoralizing tendency , the injustice , and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous and well disposed of a degraded paper currency authorized by law or in any way countenanced by government . It is one of the most successful devices , in times of peace or war , of expansions or revulsions , to accomplish the transfer of all the precious metals from the great mass of the people into the hands of the few , where they are hoarded in secret places or deposited under bolts and bars , while the people are left to endure all the inconvenience , sacrifice , and demoralization resulting from the use of depreciated and worthless paper . The Secretary of the Interior in his report gives valuable information in reference to the interests confided to the supervision of his Department , and reviews the operations of the Land Office , Pension Office , Patent Office , and Indian Bureau . During the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1868 , 6 , 655 , 700 acres of public land were disposed of . The entire cash receipts of the General Land Office for the same period were 1 , 632 , 745 , being greater by 284 , 883 than the amount realized from the same sources during the previous year . The entries under the homestead law cover 2 , 328 , 923 acres , nearly one fourth of which was taken under the act of June 21 , 1866 , which applies only to the States of Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , Arkansas , and Florida . On the 30th of June , 1868 , 169 , 643 names were borne on the pension rolls , and during the year ending on that day the total amount paid for pensions , including the expenses of disbursement , was 24 , 010 , 982 , being 5 , 391 , 025 greater than that expended for like purposes during the preceding year . During the year ending the 30th of September last the expenses of the Patent Office exceeded the receipts by 171 , and , including reissues and designs , 14 , 153 patents were issued . Treaties with various Indian tribes have been concluded , and will be submitted to the Senate for its constitutional action . I cordially sanction the stipulations which provide for reserving lands for the various tribes , where they may be encouraged to abandon their nomadic habits and engage in agricultural and industrial pursuits . This policy , inaugurated many years since , has met with signal success whenever it has been pursued in good faith and with becoming liberality by the United States . The necessity for extending it as far as practicable in our relations with the aboriginal population is greater now than at any preceding period . Whilst we furnish subsistence and instruction to the Indians and guarantee the undisturbed enjoyment of their treaty rights , we should habitually insist upon the faithful observance of their agreement to remain within their respective reservations . This is the only mode by which collisions with other tribes and with the whites can be avoided and the safety of our frontier settlements secured . The companies constructing the railway from Omaha to Sacramento have been most energetically engaged in prosecuting the work , and it is believed that the line will be completed before the expiration of the next fiscal year . The 6 per cent bonds issued to these companies amounted on the 5th instant to 44 , 337 , 000 , and additional work had been performed to the extent of 3 , 200 , 000 . The Secretary of the Interior in August last invited my attention to the report of a Government director of the Union Pacific Railroad Company who had been specially instructed to examine the location , construction , and equipment of their road . I submitted for the opinion of the Attorney General certain questions in regard to the authority of the Executive which arose upon this report and those which had from time to time been presented by the commissioners appointed to inspect each successive section of the work . After carefully considering the law of the case , he affirmed the right of the Executive to order , if necessary , a thorough revision of the entire road . Commissioners were thereupon appointed to examine this and other lines , and have recently submitted a statement of their investigations , of which the report of the Secretary of the Interior furnishes specific information . The report of the Secretary of War contains information of interest and importance respecting the several bureaus of the War Department and the operations of the Army . The strength of our military force on the 30th of September last was 48 , 000 men , and it is computed that by the 1st of January next this number will be decreased to 43 , 000 . It is the opinion of the Secretary of War that within the next year a considerable diminution of the infantry force may be made without detriment to the interests of the country and in view of the great expense attending the military peace establishment and the absolute necessity of retrenchment wherever it can be applied , it is hoped that Congress will sanction the reduction which his report recommends . While in 1860 sixteen thousand three hundred men cost the nation 16 , 472 , 000 , the sum of 65 , 682 , 000 is estimated as necessary for the support of the Army during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1870 . The estimates of the War Department for the last two fiscal years were , for 1867 , 33 , 814 , 461 , and for 1868 25 , 205 , 669 . The actual expenditures during the same periods were , respectively , 95 , 224 , 415 and 123 , 246 , 648 . The estimate submitted in December last for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1869 , was 77 , 124 , 707 the expenditures for the first quarter , ending the 30th of September last , were 27 , 219 , 117 , and the Secretary of the Treasury gives 66 , 000 , 000 as the amount which will probably be required during the remaining three quarters , if there should be no reduction of the Army making its aggregate cost for the year considerably in excess of ninety three millions . The difference between the estimates and expenditures for the three fiscal years which have been named is thus shown to be 175 , 545 , 343 for this single branch of the public service . The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the operations of that Department and of the Navy during the year . A considerable reduction of the force has been effected . There are 42 vessels , carrying 411 guns , in the six squadrons which are established in different parts of the world . Three of these vessels are returning to the United States and 4 are used as storeships , leaving the actual cruising force 35 vessels , carrying 356 guns . The total number of vessels in the Navy is 206 , mounting 1 , 743 guns . Eighty one vessels of every description are in use , armed with 696 guns . The number of enlisted men in the service , including apprentices , has been reduced to 8 , 500 . An increase of navy yard facilities is recommended as a measure which will in the event of war be promotive of economy and security . A more thorough and systematic survey of the North Pacific Ocean is advised in view of our recent acquisitions , our expanding commerce , and the increasing intercourse between the Pacific States and Asia . The naval pension fund , which consists of a moiety of the avails of prizes captured during the war , amounts to 14 , 000 , 000 . Exception is taken to the act of 23d July last , which reduces the interest on the fund loaned to the Government by the Secretary , as trustee , to 3 per cent instead of 6 per cent , which was originally stipulated when the investment was made . An amendment of the pension laws is suggested to remedy omissions and defects in existing enactments . The expenditures of the Department during the last fiscal year were 20 , 120 , 394 , and the estimates for the coming year amount to 20 , 993 , 414 . The Postmaster General s report furnishes a full and clear exhibit of the operations and condition of the postal service . The ordinary postal revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1868 , was 16 , 292 , 600 , and the total expenditures , embracing all the service for which special appropriations have been made by Congress , amounted to 22 , 730 , 592 , showing an excess of expenditures of 6 , 437 , 991 . Deducting from the expenditures the sum of 1 , 896 , 525 , the amount of appropriations for ocean steamship and other special service , the excess of expenditures was 4 , 541 , 466 . By using an unexpended balance in the Treasury of 3 , 800 , 000 the actual sum for which a special appropriation is required to meet the deficiency is 741 , 466 . The causes which produced this large excess of expenditure over revenue were the restoration of service in the late insurgent States and the putting into operation of new service established by acts of Congress , which amounted within the last two years and a half to about 48 , 700 miles equal to more than one third of the whole amount of the service at the close of the war . New postal conventions with Great Britain , North Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands , Switzerland , and Italy , respectively , have been carried into effect . Under their provisions important improvements have resulted in reduced rates of international postage and enlarged mail facilities with European countries . The cost of the United States transatlantic ocean mail service since January 1 , 1868 , has been largely lessened under the operation of these new conventions , a reduction of over one half having been effected under the new arrangements for ocean mail steamship service which went into effect on that date . The attention of Congress is invited to the practical suggestions and recommendations made in his report by the Postmaster General . No important question has occurred during the last year in our accustomed cordial and friendly intercourse with Costa Rica , Guatemala , Honduras , San Salvador , France , Austria , Belgium , Switzerland , Portugal , the Netherlands , Denmark , Sweden and Norway , Rome , Greece , Turkey , Persia , Egypt , Liberia , Morocco , Tripoli , Tunis , Muscat , Siam , Borneo , and Madagascar . Cordial relations have also been maintained with the Argentine and the Oriental Republics . The expressed wish of Congress that our national good offices might be tendered to those Republics , and also to Brazil and Paraguay , for bringing to an end the calamitous war which has so long been raging in the valley of the La Plata , has been assiduously complied with and kindly acknowledged by all the belligerents . That important negotiation , however , has thus far been without result . Charles Washburn , late United States minister to Paraguay , having resigned , and being desirous to return to the United States , the rear admiral commanding the South Atlantic Squadron was early directed to send a ship of war to Asuncion , the capital of Paraguay , to receive Washburn and his family and remove them from a situation which was represented to be endangered by faction and foreign war . The Brazilian commander of the allied invading forces refused permission to the Wasp to pass through the blockading forces , and that vessel returned to its accustomed anchorage . Remonstrance having been made against this refusal , it was promptly overruled , and the Wasp therefore resumed her errand , received Washburn and his family , and conveyed them to a safe and convenient seaport . In the meantime an excited controversy had arisen between the President of Paraguay and the late United States minister , which , it is understood , grew out of his proceedings in giving asylum in the United States legation to alleged enemies of that Republic . The question of the right to give asylum is one always difficult and often productive of great embarrassment . In states well organized and established , foreign powers refuse either to concede or exercise that right , except as to persons actually belonging to the diplomatic service . On the other hand , all such powers insist upon exercising the right of asylum in states where the law of nations is not fully acknowledged , respected . and obeyed . The President of Paraguay is understood to have opposed to Washburn s proceedings the injurious and very improbable charge of personal complicity in insurrection and treason . The correspondence , however , has not yet reached the United States . Washburn , in connection with this controversy , represents that two United States citizens attached to the legation were arbitrarily seized at his side , when leaving the capital of Paraguay , committed to prison , and there subjected to torture for the purpose of procuring confessions of their own criminality and testimony to support the President s allegations against the United States minister . McMahon , the newly appointed minister to Paraguay , having reached the La Plata , has been instructed to proceed without delay to Asuncion , there to investigate the whole subject . The rear admiral commanding the United States South Atlantic Squadron has been directed to attend the new minister with a proper naval force to sustain such just demands as the occasion may require , and to vindicate the rights of the United States citizens referred to and of any others who may be exposed to danger in the theater of war . With these exceptions , friendly relations have been maintained between the United States and Brazil and Paraguay . Our relations during the past year with Bolivia , Ecuador , Peru , and Chile have become especially friendly and cordial . Spain and the Republics of Peru , Bolivia , and Ecuador have expressed their willingness to accept the mediation of the United States for terminating the war upon the South Pacific coast . Chile has not finally declared upon the question . In the meantime the conflict has practically exhausted itself , since no belligerent or hostile movement has been made by either party during the last two years , and there are no indications of a present purpose to resume hostilities on either side . Great Britain and France have cordially seconded our proposition of mediation , and I do not forego the hope that it may soon be accepted by all the belligerents and lead to a secure establishment of peace and friendly relations between the Spanish American Republics of the Pacific and Spain a result which would be attended with common benefits to the belligerents and much advantage to all commercial nations . I communicate , for the consideration of Congress , a correspondence which shows that the Bolivian Republic has established the extremely liberal principle of receiving into its citizenship any citizen of the United States , or of any other of the American Republics , upon the simple condition of voluntary registry . The correspondence herewith submitted will be found painfully replete with accounts of the ruin and wretchedness produced by recent earthquakes , of unparalleled severity , in the Republics of Peru , Ecuador , and Bolivia . The diplomatic agents and naval officers of the United States who were present in those countries at the time of those disasters furnished all the relief in their power to the sufferers , and were promptly rewarded with grateful and touching acknowledgments by the Congress of Peru . An appeal to the charity of our fellow citizens has been answered by much liberality . In this connection I submit an appeal which has been made by the Swiss Republic , whose Government and institutions are kindred to our own , in behalf of its inhabitants , who are suffering extreme destitution , produced by recent devastating inundations . Our relations with Mexico during the year have been marked by an increasing growth of mutual confidence . The Mexican Government has not yet acted upon the three treaties celebrated here last summer for establishing the rights of naturalized citizens upon a liberal and just basis , for regulating consular powers , and for the adjustment of mutual claims . All commercial nations , as well as all friends of republican institutions , have occasion to regret the frequent local disturbances which occur in some of the constituent States of Colombia . Nothing has occurred , however , to affect the harmony and cordial friendship which have for several years existed between that youthful and vigorous Republic and our own . Negotiations are pending with a view to the survey and construction of a ship canal across the Isthmus of Darien , under the auspices of the United States . I hope to be able to submit the results of that negotiation to the Senate during its present session . The very liberal treaty which was entered into last year by the United States and Nicaragua has been ratified by the latter Republic . Costa Rica , with the earnestness of a sincerely friendly neighbor , solicits a reciprocity of trade , which I commend to the consideration of Congress . The convention created by treaty between the United States and Venezuela in July , 1865 , for the mutual adjustment of claims , has been held , and its decisions have been received at the Department of State . The heretofore recognized Government of the United States of Venezuela has been subverted . A provisional government having been instituted under circumstances which promise durability , it has been formally recognized . I have been reluctantly obliged to ask explanation and satisfaction for national injuries committed by the President of Hayti . The political and social condition of the Republics of Hayti and Domingo is very unsatisfactory and painful . The abolition of slavery , which has been carried into effect throughout the island of Domingo and the entire West Indies , except the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico , has been followed by a profound popular conviction of the rightfulness of republican institutions and an intense desire to secure them . The attempt , however , to establish republics there encounters many obstacles , most of which may be supposed to result from long indulged habits of colonial supineness and dependence upon European monarchical powers . While the United States have on all occasions professed a decided unwillingness that any part of this continent or of its adjacent islands shall be made a theater for a new establishment of monarchical power , too little has been done by us , on the other hand , to attach the communities by which we are surrounded to our own country , or to lend even a moral support to the efforts they are so resolutely and so constantly making to secure republican institutions for themselves . It is indeed a question of grave consideration whether our recent and present example is not calculated to check the growth and expansion of free principles , and make those communities distrust , if not dread , a government which at will consigns to military domination States that are integral parts of our Federal Union , and , while ready to resist any attempts by other nations to extend to this hemisphere the monarchical institutions of Europe , assumes to establish over a large portion of its people a rule more absolute , harsh , and tyrannical than any known to civilized powers . The acquisition of Alaska was made with the view of extending national jurisdiction and republican principles in the American hemisphere . Believing that a further step could be taken in the same direction , I last year entered into a treaty with the King of Denmark for the purchase of the islands of Thomas and John , on the best terms then attainable , and with the express consent of the people of those islands . This treaty still remains under consideration in the Senate . A new convention has been entered into with Denmark , enlarging the time fixed for final ratification of the original treaty . Comprehensive national policy would seem to sanction the acquisition and incorporation into our Federal Union of the several adjacent continental and insular communities as speedily as it can be done peacefully , lawfully , and without any violation of national justice , faith , or honor . Foreign possession or control of those communities has hitherto hindered the growth and impaired the influence of the United States . Chronic revolution and anarchy there would be equally injurious . Each one of them , when firmly established as an independent republic , or when incorporated into the United States , would be a new source of strength and power . Conforming my Administration to these principles , I have or no occasion lent support or toleration to unlawful expeditions set on foot upon the plea of republican propagandism or of national extension or aggrandizement . The necessity , however , of repressing such unlawful movements clearly indicates the duty which rests upon us of adapting our legislative action to the new circumstances of a decline of European monarchical power and influence and the increase of American republican ideas , interests , and sympathies . It can not be long before it will become necessary for this Government to lend some effective aid to the solution of the political and social problems which are continually kept before the world by the two Republics of the island of Domingo , and which are now disclosing themselves more distinctly than heretofore in the island of Cuba . The subject is commended to your consideration with all the more earnestness because I am satisfied that the time has arrived when even so direct a proceeding as a proposition for an annexation of the two Republics of the island of Domingo would not only receive the consent of the people interested , but would also give satisfaction to all other foreign nations . I am aware that upon the question of further extending our possessions it is apprehended by some that our political system can not successfully be applied to an area more extended than our continent but the conviction is rapidly gaining ground in the American mind that with the increased facilities for intercommunication between all portions of the earth the principles of free government , as embraced in our Constitution , if faithfully maintained and carried out , would prove of sufficient strength and breadth to comprehend within their sphere and influence the civilized nations of the world . The attention of the Senate and of Congress is again respectfully invited to the treaty for the establishment of commercial reciprocity with the Hawaiian Kingdom entered into last year , and already ratified by that Government . The attitude of the United States toward these islands is not very different from that in which they stand toward the West Indies . It is known and felt by the Hawaiian Government and people that their Government and institutions are feeble and precarious that the United States , being so near a neighbor , would be unwilling to see the islands pass under foreign control . Their prosperity is continually disturbed by expectations and alarms of unfriendly political proceedings , as well from the United States as from other foreign powers . A reciprocity treaty , while it could not materially diminish the revenues of the United States , would be a guaranty of the good will and forbearance of all nations until the people of the islands shall of themselves , at no distant day , voluntarily apply for admission into the Union . The Emperor of Russia has acceded to the treaty negotiated here in January last for the security of trade marks in the interest of manufacturers and commerce . I have invited his attention to the importance of establishing , now while it seems easy and practicable , a fair and equal regulation of the vast fisheries belonging to the two nations in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean . The two treaties between the United States and Italy for the regulation of consular powers and the extradition of criminals , negotiated and ratified here during the last session of Congress , have been accepted and confirmed by the Italian Government . A liberal consular convention which has been negotiated with Belgium will be submitted to the Senate . The very important treaties which were negotiated between the United States and North Germany and Bavaria for the regulation of the rights of naturalized citizens have been duly ratified and exchanged , and similar treaties have been entered into with the Kingdoms of Belgium and Wurtemberg and with the Grand Duchies of Baden and Hesse Darmstadt . I hope soon to be able to submit equally satisfactory conventions of the same character now in the course of negotiation with the respective Governments of Spain , Italy , and the Ottoman Empire . Examination of claims against the United States by the Hudsons Bay Company and the Puget Sound Agricultural Company , on account of certain possessory rights in the State of Oregon and Territory of Washington , alleged by those companies in virtue of provisions of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain of June 15 , 1846 , has been diligently prosecuted , under the direction of the joint international commission to which they were submitted for adjudication by treaty between the two Governments of July 1 , 1863 , and will , it is expected , be concluded at an early day . No practical regulation concerning colonial trade and the fisheries can be accomplished by treaty between the United States and Great Britain until Congress shall have expressed their judgment concerning the principles involved . Three other questions , however , between the United States and Great Britain remain open for adjustment . These are the mutual rights of naturalized citizens , the boundary question involving the title to the island of San Juan , on the Pacific coast , and mutual claims arising since the year 1853 of the citizens and subjects of the two countries for injuries and depredations committed under the authority of their respective Governments . Negotiations upon these subjects are pending , and I am not without hope of being able to lay before the Senate , for its consideration during the present session , protocols calculated to bring to an end these justly exciting and long existing controversies . We are not advised of the action of the Chinese Government upon the liberal and auspicious treaty which was recently celebrated with its plenipotentiaries at this capital . Japan remains a theater of civil war , marked by religious incidents and political severities peculiar to that long isolated Empire . The Executive has hitherto maintained strict neutrality among the belligerents , and acknowledges with pleasure that it has been frankly and fully sustained in that course by the enlightened concurrence and cooperation of the other treaty powers , namely Great Britain , France , the Netherlands , North Germany , and Italy . Spain having recently undergone a revolution marked by extraordinary unanimity and preservation of order , the provisional government established at Madrid has been recognized , and the friendly intercourse which has so long happily existed between the two countries remains unchanged . I renew the recommendation contained in my communication to Congress dated the 18th July last a copy of which accompanies this message that the judgment of the people should be taken on the propriety of so amending the Federal Constitution that it shall provide First . For an election of President and Vice President by a direct vote of the people , instead of through the agency of electors , and making them ineligible for reelection to a second term . Second . For a distinct designation of the person who shall discharge the duties of President in the event of a vacancy in that office by the death , resignation , or removal of both the President and Vice President . Third . For the election of Senators of the United States directly by the people of the several States , instead of by the legislatures and Fourth . For the limitation to a period of years of the terms of Federal judges . Profoundly impressed with the propriety of making these important modifications in the Constitution , I respectfully submit them for the early and mature consideration of Congress . We should , as far as possible , remove all pretext for violations of the organic law , by remedying such imperfections as time and experience may develop , ever remembering that the constitution which at any time exists until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all . In the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution , I have thus communicated to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommended for their consideration such measures as have seemed to me necessary and expedient . If carried into effect , they will hasten the accomplishment of the great and beneficent purposes for which the Constitution was ordained , and which it comprehensively states were to form a more perfect Union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . In Congress are vested all legislative powers , and upon them devolves the responsibility as well for framing unwise and excessive laws as for neglecting to devise and adopt measures absolutely demanded by the wants of the country . Let us earnestly hope that before the expiration of our respective terms of service , now rapidly drawing to a close , an all wise Providence will so guide our counsels as to strengthen and preserve the Federal Unions , inspire reverence for the Constitution , restore prosperity and happiness to our whole people , and promote on earth peace , good will toward men .<speech_sep>Whereas by an act of Congress approved March 3 , 1865 , there was established in the War Department a Bureau of Refugees , Freedmen , and Abandoned Lands , and to which , in accordance with the said act of Congress , is committed the supervision and management of all abandoned lands and the control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from rebel States , or from any district of country within the territory embraced in the operations of the Army , under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the head of the Bureau and approved by the President and Whereas it appears that the management of abandoned lands and subjects relating to refugees and freedmen , as aforesaid , have been and still are , by orders based on military exigencies or legislation based on previous statutes , partly in the hands of military officers disconnected with said Bureau and partly in charge of officers of the Treasury Department It is therefore Ordered , That all officers of the Treasury Department , all military officers , and all others in the service of the United States turn over to the authorized officers of said Bureau all abandoned lands and property contemplated in said act of Congress approved March 3 , 1865 , establishing the Bureau of Refugees , Freedmen , and Abandoned Lands , that may now be under or within their control . They will also turn over to such officers all funds collected by tax or otherwise for the benefit of refugees or freedmen or accruing from abandoned lands or property set apart for their use , and will transfer to them all official records connected with the administration of affairs which pertain to said Bureau .<speech_sep>
