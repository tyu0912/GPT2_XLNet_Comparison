To the Senate of the United States I have received a copy of the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 21st instant , as follows Whereas the Senate have received and considered the communication of the President stating that he had removed Edwin Stanton , Secretary of War , and had designated the Adjutant General of the Army to act as Secretary of War ad interim Therefore , Resolved by the Senate of the United States , that under the Constitution and laws of the United States the President has no power to remove the Secretary of War and designate any other officer to perform the duties of that office ad interim . This resolution is confined to the power of the President to remove the Secretary of War and to designate another officer to perform the duties of the office ad interim , and by its preamble is made expressly applicable to the removal of Stanton and the designation to act ad interim of the Adjutant General of the Army . Without , therefore , attempting to discuss the general power of removal as to all officers , upon which subject no expression of opinion is contained in the resolution , I shall confine myself to the question as thus limited the power to remove the Secretary of War . It is declared in the resolution That under the Constitution and laws of the United States the President has no power to remove the Secretary of War and designate any other officer to perform the duties of that office ad interim . As to the question of power under the Constitution , I do not propose at present to enter upon its discussion . The uniform practice from the beginning of the Government , as established by every President who has exercised the office , and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have settled the question in favor of the power of the President to remove all officers excepting a class holding appointments of a judicial character . No practice nor any decision has ever excepted a Secretary of War from this general power of the President to make removals from office . It is only necessary , then , that I should refer to the power of the Executive , under the laws of the United States , to remove from office a Secretary of War . The resolution denies that under these laws this power has any existence . In other words , it affirms that no such authority is recognized or given by the statutes of the country . What , then , are the laws of the United States which deny the President the power to remove that officer I know but two laws which bear upon this question . The first in order of time is the act of August 7 , 1789 , creating the Department of War , which , after providing for a Secretary as its principal officer , proceeds as follows SE2 . And be it further enacted , That there shall be in the said Department an inferior officer , to be appointed by the said principal officer , to be employed therein as he shall deem proper , and to be called the chief clerk in the Department of War , and who , whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States , or in any other case of vacancy , shall during such vacancy have the charge and custody of all records , books , and papers appertaining to the said Department . It is clear that this act , passed by a Congress many of whose members participated in the formation of the Constitution , so far from denying the power of the President to remove the Secretary of War , recognizes it as existing in the Executive alone , without the concurrence of the Senate or of any other department of the Government . Furthermore , this act does not purport to confer the power by legislative authority , nor in fact was there any other existing legislation through which it was bestowed upon the Executive . The recognition of the power by this act is therefore complete as a recognition under the Constitution itself for there was no other source or authority from which it could be derived . The other act which refers to this question is that regulating the tenure of certain civil offices , passed by Congress on the 2d day of March , 1867 . The first section of that act is in the following words That every person holding any civil office to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , and every person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office , and shall become duly qualified to act therein , is and shall be entitled to hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified , except as herein otherwise provided Provided , That the Secretaries of State , of the Treasury , of War , of the Navy , and of the Interior , the Postmaster General , and the Attorney General shall hold their offices , respectively , for and during the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed and for one month thereafter , subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . The fourth section of the same act restricts the term of offices to the limit prescribed by the law creating them . That part of the first section which precedes the proviso declares that every person holding a civil office to which he has been or may be appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed . It purports to take from the Executive , during the fixed time established for the tenure of the office , the independent power of removal , and to require for such removal the concurrent action of the President and the Senate . The proviso that follows proceeds to fix the term of office of the seven heads of Departments , whose tenure never had been defined before , by prescribing that they shall hold their offices , respectively , for and during the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed and for one month thereafter , subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . Thus , as to these enumerated officers , the proviso takes from the President the power of removal except with the advice and consent of the Senate . By its terms , however , before he can be deprived of the power to displace them it must appear that he himself has appointed them . It is only in that case that they have any tenure of office or any independent right to hold during the term of the President and for one month after the cessation of his official functions . The proviso , therefore , gives no tenure of office to any one of these officers who has been appointed by a former President beyond one month after the accession of his successor . In the case of Stanton , the only appointment under which he held the office of Secretary of War was that conferred upon him by my immediate predecessor , with the advice and consent of the Senate . He has never held from me any appointment as the head of the War Department . Whatever fight he had to hold the office was derived from that original appointment and my own sufferance . The law was not intended to protect such an incumbent of the War Department by taking from the President the power to remove him . This , in my judgment , is perfectly clear , and the law itself admits of no other just construction . We find in all that portion of the first section which precedes the proviso that as to civil officers generally the President is deprived of the power of removal , and it is plain that if there had been no proviso that power would just as clearly have been taken from him so far as it applies to the seven heads of Departments . But for reasons which were no doubt satisfactory to Congress these principal officers were specially provided for , and as to them the express and only requirement is that the President who has appointed them shall not without the advice and consent of the Senate remove them from office . The consequence is that as to my Cabinet , embracing the seven officers designated in the first section , the act takes from me the power , without the concurrence of the Senate , to remove any one of them that I have appointed , but it does not protect such of them as I did not appoint , nor give to them any tenure of office beyond my pleasure . An examination of this act , then , shows that while in one part of the section provision is made for officers generally , in another clause there is a class of officers , designated by their official titles , who are excepted from the general terms of the law , and in reference to whom a clear distinction is made as to the general power of removal limited in the first clause of the section . This distinction is that as to such of these enumerated officers as hold under the appointment of the President the power of removal can only be exercised by him with the consent of the Senate , while as to those who have not been appointed by him there is no like denial of his power to displace them . It would be a violation of the plain meaning of this enactment to place Stanton upon the same footing as those heads of Departments who have been appointed by myself . As to him , this law gives him no tenure of office . The members of my Cabinet who have been appointed by me are by this act entitled to hold for one month after the term of my office shall cease but Stanton could not , against the wishes of my successor , hold a moment thereafter . If he were permitted by that successor to hold for the first two weeks , would that successor have no power to remove him But the power of my successor over him could be no greater than my own . If my successor would have the power to remove Stanton after permitting him to remain a period of two weeks , because he was not appointed by him , but by his predecessor , who have tolerated Stanton for more than two years , certainly have the same right to remove him , and upon the same ground , namely , that he was not appointed by me , but by my predecessor . Under this construction of the tenure of office act , I have never doubted my power to remove Stanton . Whether the act were constitutional or not , it was always my opinion that it did not secure him from removal . I was , however , aware that there were doubts as to the construction of the law , and from the first I deemed it desirable that at the earliest possible moment those doubts should be settled and the true construction of the act fixed by decision of the Supreme Court of the United States . My order of suspension in August last was intended to place the case in such a position as would make a resort to a judicial decision both necessary and proper . My understanding and wishes , however , under that order of suspension were frustrated , and the late order for Stanton s removal was a further step toward the accomplishment of that purpose . I repeat that my own convictions as to the true construction of the law and as to its constitutionality were well settled and were sustained by every member of my Cabinet , including Stanton himself . Upon the question of constitutionality , each one in turn deliberately advised me that the tenure of office act was unconstitutional . Upon the question whether , as to those members who were appointed by my predecessor , that act took from me the power to remove them , one of those members emphatically stated in the presence of the others sitting in Cabinet that they did not come within the provisions of the act , and it was no protection to them . No one dissented from this construction , and I understood them all to acquiesce in its correctness . In a matter of such grave consequence I was not disposed to rest upon my own opinions , though fortified by my constitutional advisers . I have therefore sought to bring the question at as early a day as possible before the Supreme Court of the United States for final and authoritative decision . In respect to so much of the resolution as relates to the designation of an officer to act as Secretary of War ad interim , I have only to say that I have exercised this power under the provisions of the first section of the act of February 13 , 1795 , which , so far as they are applicable to vacancies caused by removals , I understand to be still in force . The legislation upon the subject of ad interim appointments in the Executive Departments stands , as to the War Office , as follows The second section of the act of the 7th of August , 1789 , makes provision for a vacancy in the very case of a removal of the head of the War Department , and upon such a vacancy gives the charge and custody of the records , books , and papers to the chief clerk . Next , by the act of the 8th of May , 1792 , section 8 , it is provided that in case of a vacancy occasioned by death , absence from the seat of Government , or sickness of the head of the War Department the President may authorize a person to perform the duties of the office until a successor is appointed or the disability removed . The act , it will be observed , does not provide for the case of a vacancy caused by removal . Then , by the first section of the act of February 13 , 1795 , it is provided that in case of any vacancy the President may appoint a person to perform the duties while the vacancy exists . These acts are followed by that of the 20th of February , 1863 , by the first section of which provision is again made for a vacancy caused by death , resignation , absence from the seat of Government , or sickness of the head of any Executive Department of the Government , and upon the occurrence of such a vacancy power is given to the President to authorize the head of any other Executive Department , or other officer in either of said Departments whose appointment is vested in the President , at his discretion , to perform the duties of the said respective offices until a successor be appointed or until such absence or inability by sickness shall cease Provided , That no one vacancy shall be supplied in manner aforesaid for a longer term than six months . This law , with some modifications , reenacts the act of 1792 , and provides , as did that act , for the sort of vacancies so to be filled but , like the act of 1792 , it makes no provision for a vacancy occasioned by removal . It has reference altogether to vacancies arising from other causes . According to my construction of the act of 1863 , while it impliedly repeals the act of 1792 regulating the vacancies therein described , it has no bearing whatever upon so much of the act of 1795 as applies to a vacancy caused by removal . The act of 1795 therefore furnishes the rule for a vacancy occasioned by removal one of the vacancies expressly referred to in the act of the 7th of August , 1789 , creating the Department of War . Certainly there is no express repeal by the act of 1863 of the act of 1795 . The repeal , if there is any , is by implication , and can only be admitted so far as there is a clear inconsistency between the two acts . The act of 1795 is inconsistent with that of 1863 as to a vacancy occasioned by death , resignation , absence , or sickness , but not at all inconsistent as to a vacancy caused by removal . It is assuredly proper that the President should have the same power to fill temporarily a vacancy occasioned by removal as he has to supply a place made vacant by death or the expiration of a term . If , for instance , the incumbent of an office should be found to be wholly unfit to exercise its functions , and the public service should require his immediate expulsion , a remedy should exist and be at once applied , and time be allowed the President to select and appoint a successor , as is permitted him in case of a vacancy caused by death or the termination of an official term . The necessity , therefore , for an ad interim appointment is just as great , and , indeed , may be greater in cases of removal than in any others . Before it be held , therefore , that the power given by the act of 1795 in cases of removal is abrogated by succeeding legislation an express repeal ought to appear . So wholesome a power should certainly not be taken away by loose implication . It may be , however , that in this , as in other cases of implied repeal , doubts may arise . It is confessedly one of the most subtle and debatable questions which arise in the construction of statutes . If upon such a question I have fallen into an erroneous construction , I submit whether it should be characterized as a violation of official duty and of law . I have deemed it proper , in vindication of the course which I have considered it my duty to take , to place before the Senate the reasons upon which I have based my action . Although I have been advised by every member of my Cabinet that the entire tenure of office act is unconstitutional , and therefore void , and although I have expressly concurred in that opinion in the veto message which I had the honor to submit to Congress when I returned the bill for reconsideration , I have refrained from making a removal of any officer contrary to the provisions of the law , and have only exercised that power in the case of Stanton , which , in my judgment , did not come within its provisions . I have endeavored to proceed with the greatest circumspection , and have acted only in an extreme and exceptional case , carefully following the course which I have marked out for myself as a general rule , faithfully to execute all laws , though passed over my objections on the score of constitutionality . In the present instance I have appealed , or sought to appeal , to that final arbiter fixed by the Constitution for the determination of all such questions . To this course I have been impelled by the solemn obligations which rest upon me to sustain inviolate the powers of the high office committed to my hands . Whatever may be the consequences merely personal to myself , I could not allow them to prevail against a public duty so clear to my own mind , and so imperative . If what was possible had been certain , if I had been fully advised when I removed Stanton that in thus defending the trust committed to my hands my own removal was sure to follow , I could not have hesitated . Actuated by public considerations of the highest character , I earnestly protest against the resolution of the Senate which charges me in what I have done with a violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives of the United States I return herewith the bill entitled An act supplementary to an act entitled An act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States , passed on the 2d day of March , 1867 , and the act supplementary thereto , passed on the 23d day of March , 1867 , and will state as briefly as possible some of the reasons which prevent me from giving it my approval . This is one of a series of measures passed by Congress during the last four months on the subject of reconstruction . The message returning the act of the 2d of March last states at length my objections to the passage of that measure . They apply equally well to the bill now before me , and I am content merely to refer to them and to reiterate my conviction that they are sound and unanswerable . There are some points peculiar to this bill , which I will proceed at once to consider . The first section purports to declare the true intent and meaning , in some particulars , of the two prior acts upon this subject . It is declared that the intent of those acts was , first , that the existing governments in the ten rebel States were not legal State governments , and , second , that thereafter said governments , if continued , were to be continued subject in all respects to the military commanders of the respective districts and to the paramount authority of Congress . Congress may by a declaratory act fix upon a prior act a construction altogether at variance with its apparent meaning , and from the time at least , when such a construction is fixed the original act will be construed to mean exactly what it is stated to mean by the declaratory statute . There will be , then , from the time this bill may become a law no doubt , no question , as to the relation in which the existing governments in those States , called in the original act the provisional governments , stand toward the military authority . As those relations stood before the declaratory act , these governments , it is true , were made subject to absolute military authority in many important respects , but not in all , the language of the act being subject to the military authority of the United States , as hereinafter prescribed . By the sixth section of the original act these governments were made in all respects subject to the paramount authority of the United States . Now by this declaratory act it appears that Congress did not by the original act intend to limit the military authority to any particulars or subjects therein prescribed , but meant to make it universal . Thus over all of these ten States this military government is now declared to have unlimited authority . It is no longer confined to the preservation of the public peace , the administration of criminal law , the registration of voters , and the superintendence of elections , but in all respects is asserted to be paramount to the existing civil governments . It is impossible to conceive any state of society more intolerable than this and yet it is to this condition that 12 , 000 , 000 American citizens are reduced by the Congress of the United States . Over every foot of the immense territory occupied by these American citizens the Constitution of the United States is theoretically in full operation . It binds all the people there and should protect them yet they are denied every one of its sacred guaranties . Of what avail will it be to any one of these Southern people when seized by a file of soldiers to ask for the cause of arrest or for the production of the warrant Of what avail to ask for the privilege of bail when in military custody , which knows no such thing as bail Of what avail to demand a trial by jury , process for witnesses , a copy of the indictment , the privilege of counsel , or that greater privilege , the writ of habeas corpus The veto of the original bill of the 2d of March was based on two distinct grounds the interference of Congress in matters strictly appertaining to the reserved powers of the States and the establishment of military tribunals for the trial of citizens in time of peace . The impartial reader of that message will understand that all that it contains with respect to military despotism and martial law has reference especially to the fearful power conferred on the district commanders to displace the criminal courts and assume jurisdiction to try and to punish by military boards that , potentially , the suspension of the habeas corpus was martial law and military despotism . The act now before me not only declares that the intent was to confer such military , authority , but also to confer unlimited military authority over all the other courts of the State and over all the offices of the State legislative , executive , and judicial . Not content with the general grant of power , Congress , in the second section of this bill , specifically gives to each military commander the power to suspend or remove from office , or from the performance of official duties and the exercise of official powers , any officer or person holding or exercising , or professing to hold or exercise , any civil or military office or duty in such district under any power , election , appointment , or authority derived from , or granted by , or claimed under any so called State , or the government thereof , or any municipal or other division thereof . A power that hitherto all the departments of the Federal Government , acting in concert or separately , have not dared to exercise is here attempted to be conferred on a subordinate military officer . To him , as a military officer of the Federal Government , is given the power , supported by a sufficient military force , to remove every civil officer of the State . What next The district commander , who has thus displaced the civil officer , is authorized to fill the vacancy by the detail of an officer or soldier of the Army , or by the appointment of some other person . This military appointee , whether an officer , a soldier , or some other person , is to perform the duties of such officer or person so suspended or removed . In other words , an officer or soldier of the Army is thus transformed into a civil officer . He may be made a governor , a legislator , or a judge . However unfit he may deem himself for such civil duties , he must obey the order . The officer of the Army must , if detailed , go upon the supreme bench of the State with the same prompt obedience as if he were detailed to go upon a court martial . The soldier , if detailed to act as a justice of the peace , must obey as quickly as if he were detailed for picket duty . What is the character of such a military civil officer This bill declares that he shall perform the duties of the civil office to which he is detailed . It is clear , however , that he does not lose his position in the military service . He is still an officer or soldier of the Army he is still subject to the rules and regulations which govern it , and must yield due deference , respect , and obedience toward his superiors . The clear intent of this section is that the officer or soldier detailed to fill a civil office must execute its duties according to the laws of the State . If he is appointed a governor of a State , he is to execute the duties as provided by the laws of that State , and for the time being his military character is to be suspended in his new civil capacity . If he is appointed a State treasurer , he must at once assume the custody and disbursement of the funds of the State , and must perform those duties precisely according to the laws of the State , for he is intrusted with no other official duty or other official power . Holding the office of treasurer and intrusted with funds , it happens that he is required by the State laws to enter into bond with security and to take an oath of office yet from the beginning of the bill to the end there is no provision for any bond or oath of office , or for any single qualification required under the State law , such as residence , citizenship , or anything else . The only oath is that provided for in the ninth section , by the terms of which everyone detailed or appointed to any civil office in the State is required to take and to subscribe the oath of office prescribed by law for officers of the United States . Thus an officer of the Army of the United States detailed to fill a civil office in one of these States gives no official bond and takes no official oath for the performance of his new duties , but as a civil officer of the State only takes the same oath which he had already taken as a military officer of the United States . He is , at last , a military officer performing civil duties , and the authority under which he acts is Federal authority only and the inevitable result is that the Federal Government , by the agency of its own sworn officers , in effect assumes the civil government of the State . A singular contradiction is apparent here . Congress declares these local State governments to be illegal governments , and then provides that these illegal governments shall be carried on by Federal officers , who are to perform the very duties imposed on its own officers by this illegal State authority . It certainly would be a novel spectacle if Congress should attempt to carry on a legal State government by the agency of its own officers . It is yet more strange that Congress attempts to sustain and carry on an illegal State government by the same Federal agency . In this connection I must call attention to the tenth and eleventh sections of the bill , which provide that none of the officers or appointees of these military commanders shall be bound in his action by any opinion of any civil officer of the United States , and that all the provisions of the act shall be construed liberally , to the end that all the intents thereof may be fully and perfectly carried out . It seems Congress supposed that this bill might require construction , and they fix , therefore , the rule to be applied . But where is the construction to come from Certainly no one can be more in want of instruction than a soldier or an officer of the Army detailed for a civil service , perhaps the most important in a State , with the duties of which he is altogether unfamiliar . This bill says he shall not be bound in his action by the opinion of any civil officer of the United States . The duties of the office are altogether civil , but when he asks for an opinion he can only ask the opinion of another military officer , who , perhaps , understands as little of his duties as he does himself and as to his action , he is answerable to the military authority , and to the military authority alone . Strictly , no opinion of any civil officer other than a judge has a binding force . But these military appointees would not be bound even by a judicial opinion . They might very well say , even when their action is in conflict with the Supreme Court of the United States , That court is composed of civil officers of the United States , and we are not bound to conform our action to any opinion of any such authority . This bill and the acts to which it is supplementary are all rounded upon the assumption that these ten communities are not States and that their existing governments are not legal . Throughout the legislation upon this subject they are called rebel States , and in this particular bill they are denominated so called States , and the vice of illegality is declared to pervade all of them . The obligations of consistency bind a legislative body as well as the individuals who compose it . It is now too late to say that these ten political communities are not States of this Union . Declarations to the contrary made in these three acts are contradicted again and again by repeated acts of legislation enacted by Congress from the year 1861 to the year 1867 . During that period , while these States were in actual rebellion , and after that rebellion was brought to a close , they have been again and again recognized as States of the Union . Representation has been apportioned to them as States . They have been divided into judicial districts for the holding of district and circuit courts of the United States , as States of the Union only can be districted . The last act on this subject was passed July 23 , 1866 , by which every one of these ten States was arranged into districts and circuits . They have been called upon by Congress to act through their legislatures upon at least two amendments to the Constitution of the United States . As States they have ratified one amendment , which required the vote of twenty seven States of the thirty six then composing the Union . When the requisite twenty seven votes were given in favor of that amendment seven of which votes were given by seven of these ten States it was proclaimed to be a part of the Constitution of the United States , and slavery was declared no longer to exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction . If these seven States were not legal States of the Union , it follows as an inevitable consequence that in some of the States slavery yet exists . It does not exist in these seven States , for they have abolished it also in their State constitutions but Kentucky not having done so , it would still remain in that State . But , in truth , if this assumption that these States have no legal State governments be true , then the abolition of slavery by these illegal governments binds no one , for Congress now denies to these States the power to abolish slavery by denying to them the power to elect a legal State legislature or to frame a constitution for any purpose , even for such a purpose as the abolition of slavery . As to the other constitutional amendment , having reference to suffrage , it happens that these States have not accepted it . The consequence is that it has never been proclaimed or understood even by Congress , to be a part of the Constitution of the United States . The Senate of the United States has repeatedly given its sanction to the appointment of judges , district attorneys , and marshals for every one of these States yet , if they are not legal States , not one of these judges is authorized to hold a court . So , too , both Houses of Congress have passed appropriation bills to pay all these judges , attorneys , and officers of the United States for exercising their functions in these States . Again , in the machinery of the internal revenue laws all these States are districted , not as Territories , but as States . So much for continuous legislative recognition . The instances cited , however , fall far short of all that might be enumerated . Executive recognition , as is well known , has been frequent and unwavering . The same may be said as to judicial recognition through the Supreme Court of the United States . That august tribunal , from first to last , in the administration of its duties in banc and upon the circuit , has never failed to recognize these ten communities as legal States of the Union . The cases depending in that court upon appeal and writ of error from these States when the rebellion began have not been dismissed upon any idea of the cessation of jurisdiction . They were carefully continued from term to term until the rebellion was entirely subdued and peace reestablished , and then they were called for argument and consideration as if no insurrection had intervened . New cases , occurring since the rebellion , have come from these States before that court by writ of error and appeal , and even by original suit , where only a State can bring such a suit . These cases are entertained by that tribunal in the exercise of its acknowledged jurisdiction , which could not attach to them if they had come from any political body other than a State of the Union . Finally , in the allotment of their circuits made by the judges at the December term , 1865 , every one of these States is put on the same footing of legality with all the other States of the Union . Virginia and North Carolina , being a part of the fourth circuit , are allotted to the Chief Justice . South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , and Florida constitute the fifth circuit , and are allotted to the late Justice Wayne . Louisiana , Arkansas , and Texas are allotted to the sixth judicial circuit . as to which there is a vacancy on the bench . The Chief Justice , in the exercise of his circuit duties , has recently held a circuit court in the State of North Carolina . If North Carolina is not a State of this Union , the Chief Justice had no authority to hold a court there , and every order , judgment , and decree rendered by him in that court were coram non judice and void . Another ground on which these reconstruction acts are attempted to be sustained is this That these ten States are conquered territory that the constitutional relation in which they stood as States toward the Federal Government prior to the rebellion has given place to a new relation that their territory is a conquered country and their citizens a conquered people , and that in this new relation Congress can govern them by military power . A title by conquest stands on clear ground it is a new title acquired by war it applies only to territory for goods or movable things regularly captured in war are called booty , or , if taken by individual soldiers , plunder . There is not a foot of the land in any one of these ten States which the United States holds by conquest , save only such land as did not belong to either of these States or to any individual owner . I mean such lands as did belong to the pretended government called the Confederate States . These lands we may claim to hold by conquest . As to all other land or territory , whether belonging to the States or to individuals , the Federal Government has now no more title or right to it than it had before the rebellion . Our own forts , arsenals , navy yards , custom houses , and other Federal property situate in those States we now hold , not by the title of conquest , but by our old title , acquired by purchase or condemnation for public use , with compensation to former owners . We have not conquered these places , but have simply repossessed them . If we require more sites for forts , custom houses , or other public use , we must acquire the title to them by purchase or appropriation in the regular mode . At this moment the United States , in the acquisition of sites for national cemeteries in these States , acquires title in the same way . The Federal courts sit in court houses owned or leased by the United States , not in the court houses of the States . The United States pays each of these States for the use of its jails . Finally , the United States levies its direct taxes and its internal revenue upon the property in these States , including the productions of the lands within their territorial limits , not by way of levy and contribution in the character of a conqueror , but in the regular way of taxation , under the same laws which apply to all the other States of the Union . From first to last , during the rebellion and since , the title of each of these States to the lands and public buildings owned by them has never been disturbed , and not a foot of it has ever been acquired by the United States , even under a title by confiscation , and not a foot of it has ever been taxed under Federal law . In conclusion I must respectfully ask the attention of Congress to the consideration of one more question arising under this bill . It vests in the military commander , subject only to the approval of the General of the Army of the United States , an unlimited power to remove from office any civil or military officer in each of these ten States , and the further power , subject to the same approval , to detail or appoint any military officer or soldier of the United States to perform the duties of the officer so removed , and to fill all vacancies occurring in those States by death , resignation , or otherwise . The military appointee thus required to perform the duties of a civil office according to the laws of the State , and , as such , required to take an oath , is for the time being a civil officer . What is his character Is he a civil officer of the State or a civil officer of the United States If he is a civil officer of the State , where is the Federal power under our Constitution which authorizes his appointment by any Federal officer If , however , he is to be considered a civil officer of the United States , as his appointment and oath would seem to indicate , where is the authority for his appointment vested by the Constitution The power of appointment of all officers of the United States , civil or military , where not provided for in the Constitution , is vested in the President , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , with this exception , that Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the President alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of Departments . But this bill , if these are to be considered inferior officers within the meaning of the Constitution , does not provide for their appointment by the President alone , or by the courts of law , or by the heads of Departments , but vests the appointment in one subordinate executive officer , subject to the approval of another subordinate executive officer . So that , if we put this question and fix the character of this military appointee either way this provision of the bill is equally opposed to the Constitution . Take the case of a soldier or officer appointed to perform the office of judge in one of these States , and , as such , to administer the proper laws of the State . Where is the authority to be found in the Constitution for vesting in a military or an executive officer strict judicial functions to be exercised under State law It has been again and again decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that acts of Congress which have attempted to vest executive powers in the judicial courts or judges of the United States are not warranted by the Constitution . If Congress can not clothe a judge with merely executive duties , how can they clothe an officer or soldier of the Army with judicial duties over citizens of the United States who are not in the military or naval service So , too , it has been repeatedly decided that Congress can not require a State officer , executive or judicial , to perform any duty enjoined upon him by a law of the United States . How , then , can Congress confer power upon an executive officer of the United States to perform such duties in a State If Congress could not vest in a judge of one of these States any judicial authority under the United States by direct enactment , how can it accomplish the same thing indirectly , by removing the State judge and putting an officer of the United States in his place To me these considerations are conclusive of the unconstitutionality of this part of the bill now before me , and I earnestly commend their consideration to the deliberate judgment of Congress . Within a period less than a year the legislation of Congress has attempted to strip the executive department of the Government of some of its essential powers . The Constitution and the oath provided in it devolve upon the President the power and duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed . The Constitution , in order to carry out this power , gives him the choice of the agents , and makes them subject to his control and supervision . But in the execution of these laws the constitutional obligation upon the President remains , but the power to exercise that constitutional duty is effectually taken away . The military commander is as to the power of appointment made to take the place of the President , and the General of the Army the place of the Senate and any attempt on the part of the President to assert his own constitutional power may , under pretense of law , be met by official insubordination . It is to be feared that these military officers , looking to the authority given by these laws rather than to the letter of the Constitution , will recognize no authority but the commander of the district and the General of the Army . If there were no other objection than this to this proposed legislation , it would be sufficient . Whilst I hold the chief executive authority of the United States , whilst the obligation rests upon me to see that all the laws are faithfully executed , I can never willingly surrender that trust or the powers given for its execution . I can never give my assent to be made responsible for the faithful execution of laws , and at the same time surrender that trust and the powers which accompany it to any other executive officer , high or low , or to any number of executive officers . If this executive trust , vested by the Constitution in the President , is to be taken from him and vested in a subordinate officer , the responsibility will be with Congress in clothing the subordinate with unconstitutional power and with the officer who assumes its exercise . This interference with the constitutional authority of the executive department is an evil that will inevitably sap the foundations of our federal system but it is not the worst evil of this legislation . It is a great public wrong to take from the President powers conferred on him alone by the Constitution , but the wrong is more flagrant and more dangerous when the powers so taken from the President are conferred upon subordinate executive officers , and especially upon military officers . Over nearly one third of the States of the Union military power , regulated by no fixed law , rules supreme . Each one of the five district commanders , though not chosen by the people or responsible to them , exercises at this hour more executive power , military and civil , than the people have ever been willing to confer upon the head of the executive department , though chosen by and responsible to themselves . The remedy must come from the people themselves . They know what it is and how it is to be applied . At the present time they can not , according to the forms of the Constitution , repeal these laws they can not remove or control this military despotism . The remedy is , nevertheless , in their hands it is to be found in the ballot , and is a sure one if not controlled by fraud , overawed by arbitrary power , or , from apathy on their part , too long delayed . With abiding confidence in their patriotism , wisdom , and integrity , I am still hopeful of the future , and that in the end the rod of despotism will be broken , the armed heel of power lifted from the necks of the people , and the principles of a violated Constitution preserved .<speech_sep>Whereas the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and domestic violence and Whereas the President of the United States is by the Constitution made Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy , as well as chief civil executive officer of the United States , and is bound by solemn oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and Whereas the rebellion which has been waged by a portion of the people of the United States against the properly constituted authorities of the Government thereof in the most violent and revolting form , but whose organized and armed forces have now been almost entirely overcome , has in its revolutionary progress deprived the people of the State of North Carolina of all civil government and Whereas it becomes necessary and proper to carry out and enforce the obligations of the United States to the people of North Carolina in securing them in the enjoyment of a republican form of government Now , therefore , in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed upon me by the Constitution of the United States and for the purpose of enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a State government whereby justice may be established , domestic tranquillity insured , and loyal citizens protected in all their rights of life , liberty , and property , Andrew Johnson , President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , do hereby appoint William Holden provisional governor of the State of North Carolina , whose duty it shall be , at the earliest practicable period , to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening a convention composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the people of said State who are loyal to the United States , and no others , for the purpose of altering or amending the constitution thereof , and with authority to exercise within the limits of said State all the powers necessary . and proper to enable such loyal people of the State of North Carolina to restore said State to its constitutional relations to the Federal Government and to present such a republican form of State government as will entitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor and its people to protection by the United States against invasion , insurrection , and domestic violence Provided , That in any election that may be hereafter held for choosing delegates to any State convention as aforesaid no person shall be qualified as an elector or shall be eligible as a member of such convention unless he shall have previously taken and subscribed the oath of amnesty as set forth in the President s proclamation of May 29 , 1865 , and is a voter qualified as prescribed by the constitution and laws of the State of North Carolina in force immediately before the 20th day of May , 1861 , the date of the so called ordinance of secession and the said convention , when convened , or the legislature that may be thereafter assembled , will prescribe the qualification of electors and the eligibility of persons to hold office under the constitution and laws of the State a power the people of the several States composing the Federal Union have rightfully exercised from the origin of the Government to the present time .

By the President WILLIAM SEWARD , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I have examined with care the bill , which originated in the Senate and has been passed by the two Houses of Congress , to amend an act entitled An act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees , and for other purposes . Having with much regret come to the conclusion that it would not be consistent with the public welfare to give my approval to the measure , I return the hill to the Senate with my objections to its becoming a law . I might call to mind in advance of these objections that there is no immediate necessity for the proposed measure . The act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees , which was approved in the mouth of March last , has not yet expired It was thought stringent and extensive enough for the purpose in view in time of war . Before it ceases to have effect further experience may assist to guide us to a wise conclusion as to the policy to be adopted in time of peace . I share with Congress the strongest desire to secure to the freedmen the full enjoyment of their freedom and property and their entire independence and equality in making contracts for their labor , but the bill before me contains provisions which in my opinion are not warranted by the Constitution and are not well suited to accomplish the end in view . The bill proposes to establish by authority of Congress military jurisdiction over all parts of the United States containing refugees and freedmen . It would by its very nature apply with most force to those parts of the United States in which the freedmen most abound , and it expressly extends the existing temporary jurisdiction of the Freedmen s Bureau , with greatly enlarged powers , over those States in which the ordinary course of judicial proceedings has been interrupted by the rebellion . The source from which this military jurisdiction is to emanate is none other than the President of the United States , acting through the War Department and the Commissioner of the Freedmen s Bureau . The agents to carry out this military jurisdiction are to be selected either from the Army or from civil life the country is to be divided into districts and subdistricts , and the number of salaried agents to be employed may be equal to the number of counties or parishes in all the United States where freedmen and refugees are to be found . The subjects over which this military jurisdiction is to extend in every part of the United States include protection to all employees , agents , and officers of this bureau in the exercise of the duties imposed upon them by the bill . In eleven States it is further to extend over all cases affecting freedmen and refugees discriminated against by local law , custom , or prejudice . In those eleven States the bill subjects any white person who may be charged with depriving a freedman of any civil rights or immunities belonging to white persons to imprisonment or fine , or both , without , however , defining the civil rights and immunities which are thus to be secured to the freedmen by military law . This military jurisdiction also extends to all questions that may arise respecting contracts . The agent who is thus to exercise the office of a military judge may be a stranger , entirely ignorant of the laws of the place , and exposed to the errors of judgment to which all men are liable . The exercise of power over which there is no legal supervision by so vast a number of agents as is contemplated by the bill must , by the very nature of man , be attended by acts of caprice , injustice , and passion . The trials having their origin under this bill are to take place without the intervention of a jury and without any fixed rules of law or evidence . The rules on which offenses are to be heard and determined by the numerous agents are such rules and regulations as the President , through the War Department , shall prescribe . No previous presentment is required nor any indictment charging the commission of a crime against the laws but the trial must proceed on charges and specifications . The punishment will be , not what the law declares , but such as a court martial may think proper and from these arbitrary tribunals there lies no appeal , no writ of error to any of the courts in which the Constitution of the United States vests exclusively the judicial power of the country . While the territory and the classes of actions and offenses that are made subject to this measure are so extensive , the bill itself , should it become a law , will have no limitation in point of time , but will form a part of the permanent legislation of the country . I can not reconcile a system of military jurisdiction of this kind with the words of the Constitution which declare that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger , and that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . The safeguards which the experience and wisdom of ages taught our fathers to establish as securities for the protection of the innocent , the punishment of the guilty , and the equal administration of justice are to be set aside , and for the sake of a more vigorous interposition in behalf of justice we are to take the risks of the many acts of injustice that would necessarily follow from an almost countless number of agents established in every parish or county in nearly a third of the States of the Union , over whose decisions there is to be no supervision or control by the Federal courts . The power that would be thus placed in the hands of the President is such as in time of peace certainly ought never to be intrusted to any one man . If it be asked whether the creation of such a tribunal within a State is warranted as a measure of war , the question immediately presents itself whether we are still engaged in war . Let us not unnecessarily disturb the commerce and credit and industry of the country by declaring to the American people and to the world that the United States are still in a condition of civil war . At present there is no part of our country in which the authority of the United States is disputed . Offenses that may be committed by individuals should not work a forfeiture of the rights of whole communities . The country has returned , or is returning , to a state of peace and industry , and the rebellion is in fact at an end . The measure , therefore , seems to be as inconsistent with the actual condition of the country as it is at variance with the Constitution of the United States . If , passing from general considerations , we examine the bill in detail , it is open to weighty objections . In time of war it was eminently proper that we should provide for those who were passing suddenly from a condition of bondage to a state of freedom . But this bill proposes to make the Freedmen s Bureau , established by the act of 1865 as one of many great and extraordinary military measures to suppress a formidable rebellion , a permanent branch of the public administration , with its powers greatly enlarged . I have no reason to suppose , and I do not understand it to be alleged , that the act of March , 1865 , has proved deficient for the purpose for which it was passed , although at that time and for a considerable period thereafter the Government of the United States remained unacknowledged in most of the States whose inhabitants had been involved in the rebellion . The institution of slavery , for the military destruction of which the Freedmen s Bureau was called into existence as an auxiliary , has been already effectually and finally abrogated throughout the whole country by an amendment of the Constitution of the United States , and practically its eradication has received the assent and concurrence of most of those States in which it at any time had an existence . I am not , therefore , able to discern in the condition of the country anything to justify an apprehension that the powers and agencies of the Freedmen s Bureau , which were effective for the protection of freedmen and refugees during the actual continuance of hostilities and of African servitude , will now , in a time of peace and after the abolition of slavery , prove inadequate to the same proper ends . If I am correct in these views , there can be no necessity for the enlargement of the powers of the Bureau , for which provision is made in the bill . The third section of the bill authorizes a general and unlimited grant of support to the destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen , their wives and children . Succeeding sections make provision for the rent or purchase of landed estates for freedmen , and for the erection for their benefit of suitable buildings for asylums and schools , the expenses to be defrayed from the Treasury of the whole people . The Congress of the United States has never heretofore thought itself empowered to establish asylums beyond the limits of the District of Columbia , except for the benefit of our disabled soldiers and sailors . It has never founded schools for any class of our own people , not even for the orphans of those who have fallen in the defense of the Union , but has left the care of education to the much more competent and efficient control of the States , of communities , of private associations , and of individuals . It has never deemed itself authorized to expend the public money for the rent or purchase of homes for the thousands , not to say millions , of the white race who are honestly toiling from day to day for their subsistence . A system for the support of indigent persons in the United States was never contemplated by the authors of the Constitution nor can any good reason be advanced why , as a permanent establishment , it should be founded for one class or color of our people more than another . Pending the war many refugees and freedmen received support from the Government , but it was never intended that they should thenceforth be fed , clothed , educated , and sheltered by the United States . The idea on which the slaves were assisted to freedom was that on becoming free they would be a self sustaining population . Any legislation that shall imply that they are not expected to attain a self sustaining condition must have a tendency injurious alike to their character and their prospects . The appointment of an agent for every country and parish will create an immense patronage , and the expense of the numerous officers and their clerks , to be appointed by the President , will be great in the beginning , with a tendency steadily to increase . The appropriations asked by the Freedmen s Bureau as now established , for the year 1866 , amount to 11 , 745 , 000 . It may be safely estimated that the cost to be incurred under the pending bill will require double that amount more than the entire sum expended in any one year under the Administration of the second Adams . If the presence of agents in every parish and county is to be considered as a war measure , opposition , or even resistance , might be provoked so that to give effect to their jurisdiction troops would have to be stationed within reach of every one of them , and thus a large standing force be rendered necessary . Large appropriations would therefore be required to sustain and enforce military jurisdiction in every country or parish from the Potomac to the Rio Grande . The condition of our fiscal affairs is encouraging , but in order to sustain the present measure of public confidence it is necessary that we practice not merely customary economy , but , as far as possible , severe retrenchment . In addition to the objections already stated , the fifth section of the bill proposes to take away land from its former owners without any legal proceedings being first had , contrary to that provision of the Constitution which declares that no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . It does not appear that a part of the lands to which this section refers may not be owned by minors or persons of unsound mind , or by those who have been faithful to all their obligations as citizens of the United States . If any portion of the land is held by such persons , it is not competent for any authority to deprive them of it . If , on the other hand , it be found that the property is liable to confiscation , even then it can not be appropriated to public purposes until by due process of law it shall have been declared forfeited to the Government . There is still further objection to the bill , on grounds seriously affecting the class of persons to whom it is designed to bring relief . It will tend to keep the mind of the freedman in a state of uncertain expectation and restlessness , while to those among whom he lives it will be a source of constant and vague apprehension . Undoubtedly the freedman should be protected , but he should be protected by the civil authorities , especially by the exercise of all the constitutional powers of the courts of the United States and of the States . His condition is not so exposed as may at first be imagined . He is in a portion of the country where his labor can not well be spared . Competition for his services from planters , from those who are constructing or repairing railroads , and from capitalists in his vicinage or from other States will enable him to command almost his own terms . He also possesses a perfect right to change his place of abode , and if , therefore , he does not find in one community or State a mode of life suited to his desires or proper remuneration for his labor , he can move to another where that labor is more esteemed and better rewarded . In truth , however , each State , induced by its own wants and interests , will do what is necessary and proper to retain within its borders all the labor that is needed for the development of its resources . The laws that regulate supply and demand will maintain their force , and the wages of the laborer will be regulated thereby . There is no danger that the exceedingly great demand for labor will not operate in favor of the laborer . Neither is sufficient consideration given to the ability of the freedmen to protect and take care of themselves . It is no more than justice to them to believe that as they have received their freedom with moderation and forbearance , so they will distinguish themselves by their industry and thrift , and soon show the world that in a condition of freedom they are self sustaining , capable of selecting their own employment and their own places of abode , of insisting for themselves on a proper remuneration , and of establishing and maintaining their own asylums and schools . It is earnestly hoped that instead of wasting away they will by their own efforts establish for themselves a condition of respectability and prosperity . It is certain that they can attain to that condition only through their own merits and exertions . In this connection the query presents itself whether the system proposed by the bill will not , when put into complete operation , practically transfer the entire care , support , and control of 4 , 000 , 000 emancipated slaves to agents , overseers , or taskmasters , who , appointed at Washington , are to be located in every county and parish throughout the United States containing freedmen and refugees . Such a system would inevitably tend to a concentration of power in the Executive which would enable him , if so disposed , to control the action of this numerous class and use them for the attainment of his own political ends . I can not but add another very grave objection to this bill . The Constitution imperatively declares , in connection with taxation , that each State shall have at least one Representative , and fixes the rule for the number to which , in future times , each State shall be entitled . It also provides that the Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State , and adds with peculiar force that no State , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate . The original act was necessarily passed in the absence of the States chiefly to be affected , because their people were then contumaciously engaged in the rebellion . Now the case is changed , and some , at least , of those States are attending Congress by loyal representatives , soliciting the allowance of the constitutional right for representation . At the time , however , of the consideration and the passing of this bill there was no Senator or Representative in Congress from the eleven States which are to be mainly affected by its provisions . The very fact that reports were and are made against the good disposition of the people of that portion of the country is an additional reason why they need and should have representatives of their own in Congress to explain their condition , reply to accusations , and assist by their local knowledge in the perfecting of measures immediately affecting themselves . While the liberty of deliberation would then be free and Congress would have full power to decide according to its judgment , there could be no objection urged that the States most interested had not been permitted to be heard . The principle is firmly fixed in the minds of the American people that there should be no taxation without representation . Great burdens have now to be borne by all the country , and we may best demand that they shall be borne without murmur when they are voted by a majority of the representatives of all the people . I would not interfere with the unquestionable right of Congress to judge , each House for itself , of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members but that authority can not be construed as including the right to shut out in time of peace any State from the representation to which it is entitled by the Constitution . At present all the people of eleven States are excluded those who were most faithful during the war not less than others . The State of Tennessee , for instance , whose authorities engaged in rebellion , was restored to all her constitutional relations to the Union by the patriotism and energy of her injured and betrayed people . Before the war was brought to a termination they had placed themselves in relations with the General Government , had established a State government of their own , and , as they were not included in the emancipation proclamation , they by their own act had amended their constitution so as to abolish slavery within the limits of their State . I know no reason why the State of Tennessee , for example , should not fully enjoy all her constitutional relations to the United States . The President of the United States stands toward the country in a somewhat different attitude from that of any member of Congress . Each member of Congress is chosen from a single district or State the President is chosen by the people of all the States . As eleven States are not at this time represented in either branch of Congress , it would seem to be his duty on all proper occasions to present their just claims to Congress . There always will be differences of opinion in the community , and individuals may be guilty of transgressions of the law , but these do not constitute valid objections against the right of a State to representation . I would in no wise interfere with the discretion of Congress with regard to the qualifications of members but I hold it my duty to recommend to you , in the interests of peace and the interests of union , the admission of every State to its share in public legislation when . however insubordinate , insurgent , or rebellious its people may have been , it presents itself , not only in an attitude of loyalty and harmony , but in the persons of representatives whose loyalty can not be questioned under any existing constitutional or legal test . It is plain that an indefinite or permanent exclusion of any part of the country from representation must be attended by a spirit of disquiet and complaint . It is unwise and dangerous to pursue a course of measures which will unite a very large section of the country against another section of the country , however much the latter may preponderate . The course of emigration , the development of industry and business , and natural causes will raise up at the South men as devoted to the Union as those of any other part of the land but if they are all excluded from Congress , if in a permanent statute they are declared not to be in full constitutional relations to the country , they may think they have cause to become a unit in feeling and sentiment against the Government . Under the political education of the American people the idea is inherent and ineradicable that the consent of the majority of the whole people is necessary to secure a willing acquiescence in legislation . The bill under consideration refers to certain of the States as though they had not been fully restored in all their constitutional relations to the United States . If they have not , let us at once act together to secure that desirable end at the earliest possible moment . It is hardly necessary for me to inform Congress that in my own judgment most of those States , so far , at least , as depends upon their own action , have already been fully restored , and are to be deemed as entitled to enjoy their constitutional rights as members of the Union . Reasoning from the Constitution itself and from the actual situation of the country , I feel not only entitled but bound to assume that with the Federal courts restored and those of the several States in the full exercise of their functions the rights and interests of all classes of people will , with the aid of the military in cases of resistance to the laws , be essentially protected against unconstitutional infringement or violation . Should this expectation unhappily fail , which I do not anticipate , then the Executive is already fully armed with the powers conferred by the act of March , 1865 , establishing the Freedmen s Bureau , and hereafter , as heretofore , he can employ the land and naval forces of the country to suppress insurrection or to overcome obstructions to the laws . In accordance with the Constitution , I return the bill to the Senate , in the earnest hope that a measure involving questions and interests so important to the country will not become a law , unless upon deliberate consideration by the people it shall receive the sanction of an enlightened public judgment .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I return to the Senate , in which House it originated , a bill entitled An act to admit the State of Colorado into the Union , to which I can not , consistently with my sense of duty , give my approval . With the exception of an additional section , containing new provisions , it is substantially the same as the bill of a similar title passed by Congress during the last session , submitted to the President for his approval , returned with the objections contained in a message beating date the 15th of May last , and yet awaiting the reconsideration of the Senate . A second bill , having in view the same purpose , has now passed both Houses of Congress and been presented for my signature . Having again carefully considered the subject , I have been unable to perceive any reason for changing the opinions which have already been communicated to Congress . I find , on the contrary , that there are many objections to the proposed legislation of which I was not at that time aware , and that while several of those which I then assigned have in the interval gained in strength , yet others have been created by the altered character of the measures now submitted . The constitution under which the State government is proposed to be formed very properly contains a provision that all laws in force at the time of its adoption and the admission of the State into the Union shall continue as if the constitution had not been adopted . Among those laws is one absolutely prohibiting negroes and mulattoes from voting . At the recent session of the Territorial legislature a bill for the repeal of this law , introduced into the council , was almost unanimously rejected and at the very time when Congress was engaged in enacting the bill now under consideration the legislature passed an act excluding negroes and mulattoes from the right to sit as jurors . This bill was vetoed by the governor of the Territory , who held that by the laws of the United States negroes and mulattoes are citizens , and subject to the duties , as well as entitled to the rights , of citizenship . The bill , however , was passed , the objections of the governor to the contrary notwithstanding , and is now a law of the Territory . Yet in the bill now before me by which it is proposed to admit the Territory as a State , it is provided that there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or any other rights to any person by reason of race or color , excepting Indians not taxed . The incongruity thus exhibited between the legislation of Congress and that of the Territory , taken in connection with the protest against the admission of the State hereinafter referred to , would seem clearly to indicate the impolicy and injustice of the proposed enactment . It might , indeed , be a subject of grave inquiry , and doubtless will result in such inquiry if this bill becomes a law , whether it does not attempt to exercise a power not conferred upon Congress by the Federal Constitution . That instrument simply declares that Congress may admit new States into the Union . It nowhere says that Congress may make new States for the purpose of admitting them into the Union or for any other purpose and yet this bill is as clear an attempt to make the institutions as any in which the people themselves could engage . In view of this action of Congress , the house of representatives of the Territory have earnestly protested against being forced into the Union without first having the question submitted to the people . Nothing would be more reasonable than the position which they thus assume and it certainly can not be the purpose of Congress to force upon a community against their will a government which they do not believe themselves capable of sustaining . The following is a copy of the protest alluded to as officially transmitted to me Whereas it is announced in the public prints that it is the intention of Congress to admit Colorado as a State into the Union Therefore , Resolved by the house of representatives of the Territory , That , representing , as we do , the last and only legal expression of public opinion on this question , we earnestly protest against the passage of a law admitting the State without first having the question submitted to a vote of the people , for the reasons , first , that we have a right to a voice in the selection of the character of our government second , that we have not a sufficient population to support the expenses of a State government . For these reasons we trust that Congress will not force upon us a government against our will . Upon information which I considered reliable , I assumed in my message of the 15th of May last that the population of Colorado was not more than 30 , 000 , and expressed the opinion that this number was entirely too small either to assume the responsibilities or to enjoy the privileges of a State . It appears that previous to that time the legislature , with a view to ascertain the exact condition of the Territory , had passed a law authorizing a census of the population to be taken . The law made it the duty of the assessors in the several counties to take the census in connection with the annual assessments , and , in order to secure a correct enumeration of the population , allowed them a liberal compensation for the service by paying them for every name returned , and added to their previous oath of office an oath to perform this duty with fidelity . From the accompanying official report it appears that returns have been received from fifteen of the eighteen counties into which the State is divided , and that their population amounts in the aggregate to 24 , 909 . The three remaining counties are estimated to contain 3 , 000 , making a total population of 27 , 909 . This census was taken in the summer season , when it is claimed that the population is much larger than at any other period , as in the autumn miners in large numbers leave their work and return to the East with the results of their summer enterprise . The population , it will be observed , is but slightly in excess of one fifth of the number required as the basis of representation for a single congressional district in any of the States the number being 127 , 000 . I am unable to perceive any good reason for such great disparity in the right of representation , giving , as it would , to the people of Colorado not only this vast advantage in the House of Representatives , but an equality in the Senate , where the other States are represented by millions . With perhaps a single exception , no such inequality as this has ever before been attempted . I know that it is claimed that the population of the different States at the time of their admission has varied at different periods , but it has not varied much more than the population of each decade and the corresponding basis of representation for the different periods . The obvious intent of the Constitution was that no State should be admitted with a less population than the ratio for a Representative at the time of application . The limitation in the second section of the first article of the Constitution , declaring that each State shall have at least one Representative , was manifestly designed to protect the States which originally composed the Union from being deprived , in the event of a waning population , of a voice in the popular branch of Congress , and was never intended as a warrant to force a new State into the Union with a representative population far below that which might at the time be required of sister members of the Confederacy . This bill , in view of the prohibition of the same section , which declares that the number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every 30 , 000 , is at least a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution . It is respectfully submitted that however Congress , under the pressure of circumstances , may have admitted two or three States with less than a representative population at the time , there has been no instance in which an application for admission has ever been entertained when the population , as officially ascertained , was below 30 , 000 . Were there any doubt of this being the true construction of the Constitution , it would be dispelled by the early and long continued practice of the Federal Government . For nearly sixty years after the adoption of the Constitution no State was admitted with a population believed at the time to be less than the current ratio for a Representative , and the first instance in which there appears to have been a departure from the principle was in 1845 , in the case of Florida . Obviously the result of sectional strife , we would do well to regard it as a warning of evil rather than as are example for imitation and I think candid men of all parties will agree that the inspiring cause of the violation of this wholesome principle of restraint is to be found in a vain attempt to balance these antagonisms which refused to be reconciled except through the bloody arbitrament of arms . The plain facts of our history will attest that the great and leading States admitted since 1845 , viz , Iowa , Wisconsin , California , Minnesota , and Kansas , including Texas , which was admitted that year , have all come with an ample population for one Representative , and some of them with nearly or quite enough for two . To demonstrate the correctness of my views on this question , I subjoin a table containing a list of the States admitted since the adoption of the Federal Constitution , with the date of admission , the ratio of representation , and the representative population when admitted , deduced from the United States census tables , the calculation being made for the period of the decade corresponding with the date of admission . Colorado , which it is now proposed to admit as a State , contains , as has already been stated , a population less than 28 , 000 , while the present ratio of representation is 127 , 000 . There can be no reason that I can perceive for the admission of Colorado that would not apply with equal force to nearly every other Territory now organized and I submit whether , if this bill become a law , it will be possible to resist the logical conclusion that such Territories as Dakota , Montana , and Idaho must be received as States whenever they present themselves , without regard to the number of inhabitants they may respectively contain . Eight or ten new Senators and four or five new members of the House of Representatives would thus be admitted to represent a population scarcely exceeding that which in any other portion of the nation is entitled to but a single member of the House of Representatives , while the average for two Senators in the Union , as now constituted , is at least 1 , 000 , 000 people . It would surely be unjust to all other sections of the Union to enter upon a policy with regard to the admission of new States which might result in conferring such a disproportionate share of influence in the National Legislature upon communities which , in pursuance of the wise policy of our fathers , should for some years to come be retained under the fostering care and protection of the National Government . If it is deemed just and expedient now to depart from the settled policy of the nation during all its history , and to admit all the Territories to the rights and privileges of States , irrespective of their population or fitness for such government , it is submitted whether it would not be well to devise such measures as will bring the subject before the country for consideration and decision . This would seem to be eminently wise , because , as has already been stated , if it is right to admit Colorado now there is no reason for the exclusion of the other Territories . It is no answer to these suggestions that an enabling act was passed authorizing the people of Colorado to take action on this subject . It is well known that that act was passed in consequence of representations that the population reached , according to some statements , as high as 80 , 000 , and to none less than 50 , 000 , and was growing with a rapidity which by the time the admission could be consummated would secure a population of over 100 , 000 . These representations proved to have been wholly fallacious , and in addition the people of the Territory by a deliberate vote decided that they would not assume the responsibilities of a State government . By that decision they utterly exhausted all power that was conferred by the enabling act , and there has been no step taken since in relation to the admission that has had the slightest sanction or warrant of law . The proceeding upon which the present application is based was in the utter absence of all law in relation to it , and there is no evidence that the votes on the question of the formation of a State government bear any relation whatever to the sentiment of the Territory . The protest of the House of Representatives previously quoted is conclusive evidence to the contrary . But if none of these reasons existed against this proposed enactment , the bill itself , besides being inconsistent in its provisions in conferring power upon a person unknown to the laws and who may never have a legal existence , is so framed as to render its execution almost impossible . It is , indeed , a question whether it is not in itself a nullity . To say the least , it is of exceedingly doubtful propriety to confer the power proposed in this bill upon the governor elect , for as by its own terms the constitution is not to take effect until after the admission of the State , he in the meantime has no more authority than any other private citizen . But even supposing him to be clothed with sufficient authority to convene the legislature , what constitutes the State legislature to which is to be referred the submission of the conditions imposed by Congress Is it a new body to be elected and convened by proclamation of the governor elect , or is it that body which met more than a year ago under the provisions of the State constitution By reference to the second section of the schedule and to the eighteenth section of the fourth article of the State constitution it will be seen that the term of the members of the house of representatives and that of one half of the members of the senate expired on the first Monday of the present month . It is clear that if there were no intrinsic objections to the bill itself in relation to purposes to be accomplished this objection would be fatal , as it is apparent that the provisions of the third section of the bill to admit Colorado have reference to a period and a state of facts entirely different from the present and affairs as they now exist , and if carried into effect must necessarily lead to confusion . Even if it were settled that the old and not a new body were to act , it would be found impracticable to execute the law , because a considerable number of the members , as I am informed , have ceased to be residents of the Territory , and in the sixty days within which the legislature is to be convened after the passage of the act there would not be sufficient time to fill the vacancies by new elections , were there any authority under which they could be held . It may not be improper to add that if these proceedings were all regular and the result to be obtained were desirable , simple justice to the people of the Territory would require a longer period than sixty days within which to obtain action on the conditions proposed by the third section of the bill . There are , as is well known , large portions of the Territory with which there is and can be no general communication there being several counties which from November to May can only be reached by persons traveling on foot , while with other regions of the Territory , occupied by a large portion of the population , there is very little more freedom of access . Thus , if this bill should become a law , it would be impracticable to obtain any expression of public sentiment in reference to its provisions , with a view to enlighten the legislature , if the old body were called together , and , of course , equally impracticable to procure the election of a new body . This defect might have been remedied by an extension of the time and a submission of the question to the people , with a fair opportunity to enable them to express their sentiments . The admission of a new State has generally been regarded as an epoch in our history marking the onward progress of the nation but after the most careful and anxious inquiry on the subject I can not perceive that the proposed proceeding is in conformity with the policy which from the origin of the Government has uniformly prevailed in the admission of new States . I therefore return the bill to the Senate without my signature .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I return for reconsideration a bill entitled An act for the admission of the State of Nebraska into the Union , which originated in the Senate and has received the assent of both Houses of Congress . A bill having in view the same object was presented for my approval a few hours prior to the adjournment of the last session , but , submitted at a time when there was no opportunity for a proper consideration of the subject , I withheld my signature and the measure failed to become a law . It appears by the preamble of this bill that the people of Nebraska , availing themselves of the authority conferred upon them by the act passed on the 19th day of April , 1864 , have adopted a constitution which , upon due examination , is found to conform to the provisions and comply with the conditions of said act , and to be republican in its form of government , and that they now ask for admission into the Union . This proposed law would therefore seem to be based upon the declaration contained in the enabling act that upon compliance with its terms the people of Nebraska should be admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States . Reference to the bill , however , shows that while by the first section Congress distinctly accepts , ratifies , and confirms the Constitution and State government which the people of the Territory have formed for themselves , declares Nebraska to be one of the United States of America , and admits her into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever , the third section provides that this measure shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the State of Nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise , or of any other right , to any person by reason of race or color , excepting Indians not taxed and upon the further fundamental condition that the legislature of said State , by a solemn public act , shall declare the assent of said State to the said fundamental condition , and shall transmit to the President of the United States an authentic copy of said act , upon receipt whereof the President , by proclamation , shall forthwith announce the fact , whereupon said fundamental condition shall be held as a part of the organic law of the State and thereupon , and without any further proceeding on the part of Congress , the admission of said State into the Union shall be considered as complete . This condition is not mentioned in the original enabling act was not contemplated at the time of its passage was not sought by the people themselves has not heretofore been applied to the inhabitants of any State asking admission , and is in direct conflict with the constitution adopted by the people and declared in the preamble to be republican in its form of government , for in that instrument the exercise of the elective franchise and the right to hold office are expressly limited to white citizens of the United States . Congress thus undertakes to authorize and compel the legislature to change a constitution which , it is declared in the preamble , has received the sanction of the people , and which by this bill is accepted , ratified , and confirmed by the Congress of the nation . The first and third sections of the bill exhibit yet further incongruity . By the one Nebraska is admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever , while by the other Congress demands as a condition precedent to her admission requirements which in our history have never been asked of any people when presenting a constitution and State government for the acceptance of the lawmaking power . It is expressly declared by the third section that the bill shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the State of Nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise , or of any other right , to any person by reason of race or color , excepting Indians not taxed . Neither more nor less than the assertion of the right of Congress to regulate the elective franchise of any State hereafter to be admitted , this condition is in clear violation of the Federal Constitution , under the provisions of which , from the very foundation of the Government , each State has been left free to determine for itself the qualifications necessary for the exercise of suffrage within its limits . Without precedent in our legislation , it is in marked contrast with those limitations which , imposed upon States that from time to time have become members of the Union , had for their object the single purpose of preventing any infringement of the Constitution of the country . If Congress is satisfied that Nebraska at the present time possesses sufficient population to entitle her to full representation in the councils of the nation , and that her people desire an exchange of a Territorial for a State government , good faith would seem to demand that she should be admitted without further requirements than those expressed in the enabling act , with all of which , it is asserted in the preamble , her inhabitants have complied . Congress may , under the Constitution , admit new States or reject them , but the people of a State can alone make or change their organic law and prescribe the qualifications requisite for electors . Congress , however , in passing the bill in the shape in which it has been submitted for my approval , does not merely reject the application of the people of Nebraska for present admission as a State into the Union , on the ground that the constitution which they have submitted restricts the exercise of the elective franchise to the white population , but imposes conditions which , if accepted by the legislature , may , without the consent of the people , so change the organic law as to make electors of all persons within the State without distinction of race or color . In view of this fact , I suggest for the consideration of Congress whether it would not be just , expedient , and in accordance with the principles of our Government to allow the people , by popular vote or through a convention chosen by themselves for that purpose , to declare whether or not they will accept the terms upon which it is now proposed to admit them into the Union . This course would not occasion much greater delay than that which the bill contemplates when it requires that the legislature shall be convened within thirty days after this measure shall have become a law for the purpose of considering and deciding the conditions which it imposes , and gains additional force when we consider that the proceedings attending the formation of the State constitution were not in conformity with the provisions of the enabling act that in an aggregate vote of 7 , 776 the majority in favor of the constitution did not exceed 100 and that it is alleged that , in consequence of frauds , even this result can not be received as a fair expression of the wishes of the people . As upon them must fall the burdens of a State organization , it is but just that they should be permitted to determine for themselves a question which so materially affects their interests . Possessing a soil and a climate admirably adapted to those industrial pursuits which bring prosperity and greatness to a people , with the advantage of a central position on the great highway that will soon connect the Atlantic and Pacific States , Nebraska is rapidly gaining in numbers and wealth , and may within a very brief period claim admission on grounds which will challenge and secure universal assent . She can therefore wisely and patiently afford to wait . Her population is said to be steadily and even rapidly increasing , being now generally conceded as high as 40 , 000 , and estimated by some whose judgment is entitled to respect at a still greater number . At her present rate of growth she will in a very short time have the requisite population for a Representative in Congress , and , what is far more important to her own citizens , will have realized such an advance in material wealth as will enable the expenses of a State government to be borne without oppression to the taxpayer . Of new communities it may be said with special force and it is true of old ones that the inducement to emigrants , other things being equal , is in almost the precise ratio of the rate of taxation . The great States of the Northwest owe their marvelous prosperity largely to the fact that they were continued as Territories until they had grown to be wealthy and populous communities . ANDREW JOHNSON .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives To express gratitude to God in the name of the people for the preservation of the United States is my first duty in addressing you . Our thoughts next revert to the death of the late President by an act of parricidal treason . The grief of the nation is still fresh . It finds some solace in the consideration that he lived to enjoy the highest proof of its confidence by entering on the renewed term of the Chief Magistracy to which he had been elected that he brought the civil war substantially to a close that his loss was deplored in all parts of the Union , and that foreign nations have rendered justice to his memory . His removal cast upon me a heavier weight of cares than ever devolved upon any one of his predecessors . To fulfill my trust I need the support and confidence of all who are associated with me in the various departments of Government and the support and confidence of the people . There is but one way in which I can hope to gain their necessary aid . It is to state with frankness the principles which guide my conduct , and their application to the present state of affairs , well aware that the efficiency of my labors will in a great measure depend on your and their undivided approbation . The Union of the United States of America was intended by its authors to last as long as the States themselves shall last . The Union shall be perpetual are the words of the Confederation . To form a more perfect Union , by an ordinance of the people of the United States , is the declared purpose of the Constitution . The hand of Divine Providence was never more plainly visible in the affairs of men than in the framing and the adopting of that instrument . It is beyond comparison the greatest event in American history , and , indeed , is it not of all events in modern times the most pregnant with consequences for every people of the earth The members of the Convention which prepared it brought to their work the experience of the Confederation , of their several States , and of other republican governments , old and new but they needed and they obtained a wisdom superior to experience . And when for its validity it required the approval of a people that occupied a large part of a continent and acted separately in many distinct conventions , what is more wonderful than that , after earnest contention and long discussion , all feelings and all opinions were ultimately drawn in one way to its support The Constitution to which life was thus imparted contains within itself ample resources for its own preservation . It has power to enforce the laws , punish treason , and insure domestic tranquillity . In case of the usurpation of the government of a State by one man or an oligarchy , it becomes a duty of the United States to make good the guaranty to that State of a republican form of government , and so to maintain the homogeneousness of all . Does the lapse of time reveal defects A simple mode of amendment is provided in the Constitution itself , so that its conditions can always be made to conform to the requirements of advancing civilization . No room is allowed even for the thought of a possibility of its coming to an end . And these powers of self preservation have always been asserted in their complete integrity by every patriotic Chief Magistrate by Jefferson and Jackson not less than by Washington and Madison . The parting advice of the Father of his Country , while yet President , to the people of the United States was that the free Constitution , which was the work of their hands , might be sacredly maintained and the inaugural words of President Jefferson held up the preservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad . The Constitution is the work of the people of the United States , and it should be as indestructible as the people . It is not strange that the framers of the Constitution , which had no model in the past , should not have fully comprehended the excellence of their own work . Fresh from a struggle against arbitrary power , many patriots suffered from harassing fears of an absorption of the State governments by the General Government , and many from a dread that the States would break away from their orbits . But the very greatness of our country should allay the apprehension of encroachments by the General Government . The subjects that come unquestionably within its jurisdiction are so numerous that it must ever naturally refuse to be embarrassed by questions that lie beyond it . Were it otherwise the Executive would sink beneath the burden , the channels of justice would be choked , legislation would be obstructed by excess , so that there is a greater temptation to exercise some of the functions of the General Government through the States than to trespass on their rightful sphere . The absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority was at the beginning of the century enforced by Jefferson as the vital principle of republics and the events of the last four years have established , we will hope forever , that there lies no appeal to force . The maintenance of the Union brings with it the support of the State governments in all their rights , but it is not one of the rights of any State government to renounce its own place in the Union or to nullify the laws of the Union . The largest liberty is to be maintained in the discussion of the acts of the Federal Government , but there is no appeal from its laws except to the various branches of that Government itself , or to the people , who grant to the members of the legislative and of the executive departments no tenure but a limited one , and in that manner always retain the powers of redress . The sovereignty of the States is the language of the Confederacy , and not the language of the Constitution . The latter contains the emphatic words This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof , and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land , and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . Certainly the Government of the United States is a limited government , and so is every State government a limited government . With us this idea of limitation spreads through every form of administration general , State , and municipal and rests on the great distinguishing principle of the recognition of the rights of man . The ancient republics absorbed the individual in the state prescribed his religion and controlled his activity . The American system rests on the assertion of the equal right of every man to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , to freedom of conscience , to the culture and exercise of all his faculties . As a consequence the State government is limited as to the General Government in the interest of union , as to the individual citizen in the interest of freedom . States , with proper limitations of power , are essential to the existence of the Constitution of the United States . At the very commencement , when we assumed a place among the powers of the earth , the Declaration of Independence was adopted by States so also were the Articles of Confederation and when the people of the United States ordained and established the Constitution it was the assent of the States , one by one , which gave it vitality . In the event , too , of any amendment to the Constitution , the proposition of Congress needs the confirmation of States . Without States one great branch of the legislative government would be wanting . And if we look beyond the letter of the Constitution to the character of our country , its capacity for comprehending within its jurisdiction a vast continental empire is due to the system of States . The best security for the perpetual existence of the States is the supreme authority of the Constitution of the United States . The perpetuity of the Constitution brings with it the perpetuity of the States their mutual relation makes us what we are , and in our political system their connection is indissoluble . The whole can not exist without the parts , nor the parts without the whole . So long as the Constitution of the United States endures , the States will endure . The destruction of the one is the destruction of the other the preservation of the one is the preservation of the other . I have thus explained my views of the mutual relations of the Constitution and the States , because they unfold the principles on which I have sought to solve the momentous questions and overcome the appalling difficulties that met me at the very commencement of my Administration . It has been my steadfast object to escape from the sway of momentary passions and to derive a healing policy from the fundamental and unchanging principles of the Constitution . I found the States suffering from the effects of a civil war . Resistance to the General Government appeared to have exhausted itself . The United States had recovered possession of their forts and arsenals , and their armies were in the occupation of every State which had attempted to secede . Whether the territory within the limits of those States should be held as conquered territory , under military authority emanating from the President as the head of the Army , was the first question that presented itself for decision . Now military governments , established for an indefinite period , would have offered no security for the early suppression of discontent , would have divided the people into the vanquishers and the vanquished , and would have envenomed hatred rather than have restored affection . Once established , no precise limit to their continuance was conceivable . They would have occasioned an incalculable and exhausting expense . Peaceful emigration to and from that portion of the country is one of the best means that can be thought of for the restoration of harmony , and that emigration would have been prevented for what emigrant from abroad , what industrious citizen at home , would place himself willingly under military rule The chief persons who would have followed in the train of the Army would have been dependents on the General Government or men who expected profit from the miseries of their erring fellow citizens . The powers of patronage and rule which would have been exercised under the President , over a vast and populous and naturally wealthy region are greater than , unless under extreme necessity , I should be willing to intrust to any one man . They are such as , for myself , I could never , unless on occasions of great emergency , consent to exercise . The willful use of such powers , if continued through a period of years , would have endangered the purity of the general administration and the liberties of the States which remained loyal . Besides , the policy of military rule over a conquered territory would have implied that the States whose inhabitants may have taken part in the rebellion had by the act of those inhabitants ceased to exist . But the true theory is that all pretended acts of secession were from the beginning null and void . The States can not commit treason nor screen the individual citizens who may have committed treason any more than they can make valid treaties or engage in lawful commerce with any foreign power . The States attempting to secede placed themselves in a condition where their vitality was impaired , but not extinguished their functions suspended , but not destroyed . But if any State neglects or refuses to perform its offices there is the more need that the General Government should maintain all its authority and as soon as practicable resume the exercise of all its functions . On this principle I have acted , and have gradually and quietly , and by almost imperceptible steps , sought to restore the rightful energy of the General Government and of the States . To that end provisional governors have been appointed for the States , conventions called , governors elected , legislatures assembled , and Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United States . At the same time the courts of the United States , as far as could be done , have been reopened , so that the laws of the United States may be enforced through their agency . The blockade has been removed and the custom houses reestablished in ports of entry , so that the revenue of the United States may be collected . The Post Office Department renews its ceaseless activity , and the General Government is thereby enabled to communicate promptly with its officers and agents . The courts bring security to persons and property the opening of the ports invites the restoration of industry and commerce the post office renews the facilities of social intercourse and of business . And is it not happy for us all that the restoration of each one of these functions of the General Government brings with it a blessing to the States over which they are extended Is it not a sure promise of harmony and renewed attachment to the Union that after all that has happened the return of the General Government is known only as a beneficence I know very well that this policy is attended with some risk that for its success it requires at least the acquiescence of the States which it concerns that it implies an invitation to those States , by renewing their allegiance to the United States , to resume their functions as States of the Union . But it is a risk that must be taken . In the choice of difficulties it is the smallest risk and to diminish and if possible to remove all danger , I have felt it incumbent on me to assert one other power of the General Government the power of pardon . As no State can throw a defense over the crime of treason , the power of pardon is exclusively vested in the executive government of the United States . In exercising that power I have taken every precaution to connect it with the clearest recognition of the binding force of the laws of the United States and an unqualified acknowledgment of the great social change of condition in regard to slavery which has grown out of the war . The next step which I have taken to restore the constitutional relations of the States has been an invitation to them to participate in the high office of amending the Constitution . Every patriot must wish for a general amnesty at the earliest epoch consistent with public safety . For this great end there is need of a concurrence of all opinions and the spirit of mutual conciliation . All parties in the late terrible conflict must work together in harmony . It is not too much to ask , in the name of the whole people , that on the one side the plan of restoration shall proceed in conformity with a willingness to cast the disorders of the past into oblivion , and that on the other the evidence of sincerity in the future maintenance of the Union shall be put beyond any doubt by the ratification of the proposed amendment to the Constitution , which provides for the abolition of slavery forever within the limits of our country . So long as the adoption of this amendment is delayed , so long will doubt and jealousy and uncertainty prevail . This is the measure which will efface the sad memory of the past this is the measure which will most certainly call population and capital and security to those parts of the Union that need them most . Indeed , it is not too much to ask of the States which are now resuming their places in the family of the Union to give this pledge of perpetual loyalty and peace . Until it is done the past , however much we may desire it , will not be forgotten , The adoption of the amendment reunites us beyond all power of disruption it heals the wound that is still imperfectly closed it removes slavery , the element which has so long perplexed and divided the country it makes of us once more a united people , renewed and strengthened , bound more than ever to mutual affection and support . The amendment to the Constitution being adopted , it would remain for the States whose powers have been so long in abeyance to resume their places in the two branches of the National Legislature , and thereby complete the work of restoration . Here it is for you , fellow citizens of the Senate , and for you , fellow citizens of the House of Representatives , to judge , each of you for yourselves , of the elections , returns , and qualifications of your own members . The full assertion of the powers of the General Government requires the holding of circuit courts of the United States within the districts where their authority has been interrupted . In the present posture of our public affairs strong objections have been urged to holding those courts in any of the States where the rebellion has existed and it was ascertained by inquiry , that the circuit court of the United States would not be held within the district of Virginia during the autumn or early winter , nor until Congress should have an opportunity to consider and act on the whole subject . To your deliberations the restoration of this branch of the civil authority of the United States is therefore necessarily referred , with the hope that early provision will be made for the resumption of all its functions . It is manifest that treason , most flagrant in character , has been committed . Persons who are charged with its commission should have fair and impartial trials in the highest civil tribunals of the country , in order that the Constitution and the laws may be fully vindicated , the truth dearly established and affirmed that treason is a crime , that traitors should be punished and the offense made infamous , and , at the same time , that the question may be judicially settled , finally and forever , that no State of its own will has the right to renounce its place in the Union . The relations of the General Government toward the 4 , 000 , 000 inhabitants whom the war has called into freedom have engaged my most serious consideration . On the propriety of attempting to make the freedmen electors by the proclamation of the Executive I took for my counsel the Constitution itself , the interpretations of that instrument by its authors and their contemporaries , and recent legislation by Congress . When , at the first movement toward independence , the Congress of the United States instructed the several States to institute governments of their own , they left each State to decide for itself the conditions for the enjoyment of the elective franchise . During the period of the Confederacy there continued to exist a very great diversity in the qualifications of electors in the several States , and even within a State a distinction of qualifications prevailed with regard to the officers who were to be chosen . The Constitution of the United States recognizes these diversities when it enjoins that in the choice of members of the House of Representatives of the United States the electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature . After the formation of the Constitution it remained , as before , the uniform usage for each State to enlarge the body of its electors according to its own judgment , and under this system one State after another has proceeded to increase the number of its electors , until now universal suffrage , or something very near it , is the general rule . So fixed was this reservation of power in the habits of the people and so unquestioned has been the interpretation of the Constitution that during the civil war the late President never harbored the purpose certainly never evowed the purpose of disregarding it and in the acts of Congress during that period nothing can be found which , during the continuance of hostilities much less after their close , would have sanctioned any departure by the Executive from a policy which has so uniformly obtained . Moreover , a concession of the elective franchise to the freedmen by act of the President of the United States must have been extended to all colored men , wherever found , and so must have established a change of suffrage in the Northern , Middle , and Western States , not less than in the Southern and Southwestern . Such an act would have created a new class of voters , and would have been an assumption of power by the President which nothing in the Constitution or laws of the United States would have warranted . On the other hand , every danger of conflict is avoided when the settlement of the question is referred to the several States . They can , each for itself , decide on the measure , and whether it is to be adopted at once and absolutely or introduced gradually and with conditions . In my judgment the freedmen , if they show patience and manly virtues , will sooner obtain a participation in the elective franchise through the States than through the General Government , even if it had power to intervene . When the tumult of emotions that have been raised by the suddenness of the social change shall have subsided , it may prove that they will receive the kindest usage from some of those on whom they have heretofore most closely depended . But while I have no doubt that now , after the close of the war , it is not competent for the General Government to extend the elective franchise in the several States , it is equally clear that good faith requires the security of the freedmen in their liberty and their property , their right to labor , and their right to claim the just return of their labor . I can not too strongly urge a dispassionate treatment of this subject , which should be carefully kept aloof from all party strife . We must equally avoid hasty assumptions of any natural impossibility for the two races to live side by side in a state of mutual benefit and good will . The experiment involves us in no inconsistency let us , then , go on and make that experiment in good faith , and not be too easily disheartened . The country is in need of labor , and the freedmen are in need of employment , culture , and protection . While their right of voluntary migration and expatriation is not to be questioned , I would not advise their forced removal and colonization . Let us rather encourage them to honorable and useful industry , where it may be beneficial to themselves and to the country and , instead of hasty anticipations of the certainty of failure , let there be nothing wanting to the fair trial of the experiment . The change in their condition is the substitution of labor by contract for the status of slavery . The freedman can not fairly be accused of unwillingness to work so long as a doubt remains about his freedom of choice in his pursuits and the certainty of his recovering his stipulated wages . In this the interests of the employer and the employed coincide . The employer desires in his workmen spirit and alacrity , and these can be permanently secured in no other way . And if the one ought to be able to enforce the contract , so ought the other . The public interest will be best promoted if the several States will provide adequate protection and remedies for the freedmen . Until this is in some way accomplished there is no chance for the advantageous use of their labor , and the blame of ill success will not rest on them . I know that sincere philanthropy is earnest for the immediate realization of its remotest aims but time is always an element in reform . It is one of the greatest acts on record to have brought 4 , 000 , 000 people into freedom . The career of free industry must be fairly opened to them , and then their future prosperity and condition must , after all , rest mainly on themselves . If they fail , and so perish away , let us be careful that the failure shall not be attributable to any denial of justice . In all that relates to the destiny of the freedmen we need not be too anxious to read the future many incidents which , from a speculative point of view , might raise alarm will quietly settle themselves . Now that slavery is at an end , or near its end , the greatness of its evil in the point of view of public economy becomes more and more apparent . Slavery was essentially a monopoly of labor , and as such locked the States where it prevailed against the incoming of free industry . Where labor was the property of the capitalist , the white man was excluded from employment , or had but the second best chance of finding it and the foreign emigrant turned away from the region where his condition would be so precarious . With the destruction of the monopoly free labor will hasten from all pans of the civilized world to assist in developing various and immeasurable resources which have hitherto lain dormant . The eight or nine States nearest the Gulf of Mexico have a soil of exuberant fertility , a climate friendly to long life , and can sustain a denser population than is found as yet in any part of our country . And the future influx of population to them will be mainly from the North or from the most cultivated nations in Europe . From the sufferings that have attended them during our late struggle let us look away to the future , which is sure to be laden for them with greater prosperity than has ever before been known . The removal of the monopoly of slave labor is a pledge that those regions will be peopled by a numerous and enterprising population , which will vie with any in the Union in compactness , inventive genius , wealth , and industry . Our Government springs from and was made for the people not the people for the Government . To them it owes allegiance from them it must derive its courage , strength , and wisdom . But while the Government is thus bound to defer to the people , from whom it derives its existence , it should , from the very consideration of its origin , be strong in its power of resistance to the establishment of inequalities . Monopolies , perpetuities , and class legislation are contrary to the genius of free government , and ought not to be allowed . Here there is no room for favored classes or monopolies the principle of our Government is that of equal laws and freedom of industry . Wherever monopoly attains a foothold , it is sure to be a source of danger , discord , and trouble . We shall but fulfill our duties as legislators by according equal and exact justice to all men , special privileges to none . The Government is subordinate to the people but , as the agent and representative of the people , it must be held superior to monopolies , which in themselves ought never to be granted , and which , where they exist , must be subordinate and yield to the Government . The Constitution confers on Congress the right to regulate commerce among the several States . It is of the first necessity , for the maintenance of the Union , that that commerce should be free and unobstructed . No State can be justified in any device to tax the transit of travel and commerce between States . The position of many States is such that if they were allowed to take advantage of it for purposes of local revenue the commerce between States might be injuriously burdened , or even virtually prohibited . It is best , while the country is still young and while the tendency to dangerous monopolies of this kind is still feeble , to use the power of Congress so as to prevent any selfish impediment to the free circulation of men and merchandise . A tax on travel and merchandise in their transit constitutes one of the worst forms of monopoly , and the evil is increased if coupled with a denial of the choice of route . When the vast extent of our country is considered , it is plain that every obstacle to the free circulation of commerce between the States ought to be sternly guarded against by appropriate legislation within the limits of the Constitution . The report of the Secretary of the Interior explains the condition of the public lands , the transactions of the Patent Office and the Pension Bureau , the management of our Indian affairs , the progress made in the construction of the Pacific Railroad , and furnishes information in reference to matters of local interest in the District of Columbia . It also presents evidence of the successful operation of the homestead act , under the provisions of which 1 , 160 , 533 acres of the public lands were entered during the last fiscal year more than one fourth of the whole number of acres sold or otherwise disposed of during that period . It is estimated that the receipts derived from this source are sufficient to cover the expenses incident to the survey and disposal of the lands entered under this act , and that payments in cash to the extent of from 40 to 50 per cent will be made by settlers who may thus at any time acquire title before the expiration of the period at which it would otherwise vest . The homestead policy was established only after long and earnest resistance experience proves its wisdom . The lands in the hands of industrious settlers , whose labor creates wealth and contributes to the public resources , are worth more to the United States than if they had been reserved as a solitude for future purchasers . The lamentable events of the last four years and the sacrifices made by the gallant men of our Army and Navy have swelled the records of the Pension Bureau to an unprecedented extent . On the 30th day of June last the total number of pensioners was 85 , 986 , requiring for their annual pay , exclusive of expenses , the sum of 8 , 023 , 445 . The number of applications that have been allowed since that date will require a large increase of this amount for the next fiscal year . The means for the payment of the stipends due under existing laws to our disabled soldiers and sailors and to the families of such as have perished in the service of the country will no doubt be cheerfully and promptly granted . A grateful people will not hesitate to sanction any measures having for their object the relief of soldiers mutilated and families made fatherless in the efforts to preserve our national existence . The report of the Postmaster General presents an encouraging exhibit of the operations of the Post Office Department during the year . The revenues of the past year , from the loyal States alone , exceeded the maximum annual receipts from all the States previous to the rebellion in the sum of 6 , 038 , 091 and the annual average increase of revenue during the last four years , compared with the revenues of the four years immediately preceding the rebellion , was 3 , 533 , 845 . The revenues of the last fiscal year amounted to 14 , 556 , 158 and the expenditures to 13 , 694 , 728 , leaving a surplus of receipts over expenditures of 861 , 430 . Progress has been made in restoring the postal service in the Southern States . The views presented by the Postmaster General against the policy of granting subsidies to the ocean mail steamship lines upon established routes and in favor of continuing the present system , which limits the compensation for ocean service to the postage earnings , are recommended to the careful consideration of Congress . It appears from the report of the Secretary of the Navy that while at the commencement of the present year there were in commission 530 vessels of all classes and descriptions , armed with 3 , 000 guns and manned by 51 , 000 men , the number of vessels at present in commission is 117 , with 830 guns and 12 , 128 men . By this prompt reduction of the naval forces the expenses of the Government have been largely diminished , and a number of vessels purchased for naval purposes from the merchant marine have been returned to the peaceful pursuits of commerce . Since the suppression of active hostilities our foreign squadrons have been reestablished , and consist of vessels much more efficient than those employed on similar service previous to the rebellion . The suggestion for the enlargement of the navy yards , and especially for the establishment of one in fresh water for ironclad vessels , is deserving of consideration , as is also the recommendation for a different location and more ample grounds for the Naval Academy . In the report of the Secretary of War a general summary is given of the military campaigns of 1864 and 1865 , ending in the suppression of armed resistance to the national authority in the insurgent States . The operations of the general administrative bureaus of the War Department during the past year are detailed and an estimate made of the appropriations that will be required for military purposes in the fiscal year commencing the 1st day of July , 1866 . The national military force on the 1st of May , 1865 , numbered 1 , 000 , 516 men . It is proposed to reduce the military establishment to a peace footing , comprehending 50 , 000 troops of all arms , organized so as to admit of an enlargement by filling up the ranks to 82 , 600 if the circumstances of the country should require an augmentation of the Army . The volunteer force has already been reduced by the discharge from service of over 800 , 000 troops , and the Department is proceeding rapidly in the work of further reduction . The war estimates are reduced from 516 , 240 , 131 to 33 , 814 , 461 , which amount , in the opinion of the Department , is adequate for a peace establishment . The measures of retrenchment in each bureau and branch of the service exhibit a diligent economy worthy of commendation . Reference is also made in the report to the necessity of providing for a uniform militia system and to the propriety of making suitable provision for wounded and disabled officers and soldiers . The revenue system of the country is a subject of vital interest to its honor and prosperity , and should command the earnest consideration of Congress . The Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you a full and detailed report of the receipts and disbursements of the last fiscal year , of the first quarter of the present fiscal year , of the probable receipts and expenditures for the other three quarters , and the estimates for the year following the 30th of June , 1866 . I might content myself with a reference to that report , in which you will find all the information required for your deliberations and decision , but the paramount importance of the subject so presses itself on my own mind that I can not but lay before you my views of the measures which are required for the good character , and I might almost say for the existence , of this people . The life of a republic lies certainly in the energy , virtue , and intelligence of its citizens but it is equally true that a good revenue system is the life of an organized government . I meet you at a time when the nation has voluntarily burdened itself with a debt unprecedented in our annals . Vast as is its amount , it fades away into nothing when compared with the countless blessings that will be conferred upon our country and upon man by the preservation of the nation s life . Now , on the first occasion of the meeting of Congress since the return of peace , it is of the utmost importance to inaugurate a just policy , which shall at once be put in motion , and which shall commend itself to those who come after us for its continuance . We must aim at nothing less than the complete effacement of the financial evils that necessarily followed a state of civil war . We must endeavor to apply the earliest remedy to the deranged state of the currency , and not shrink from devising a policy which , with out being oppressive to the people , shall immediately begin to effect a reduction of the debt , and , if persisted in , discharge it fully within a definitely fixed number of years . It is our first duty to prepare in earnest for our recovery from the ever increasing evils of an irredeemable currency without a sudden revulsion , and yet without untimely procrastination . For that end we must each , in our respective positions , prepare the way . I hold it the duty of the Executive to insist upon frugality in the expenditures , and a sparing economy is itself a great national resource . Of the banks to which authority has been given to issue notes secured by bonds of the United States we may require the greatest moderation and prudence , and the law must be rigidly enforced when its limits are exceeded . We may each one of us counsel our active and enterprising countrymen to be constantly on their guard , to liquidate debts contracted in a paper currency , and by conducting business as nearly as possible on a system of cash payments or short credits to hold themselves prepared to return to the standard of gold and silver . To aid our fellow citizens in the prudent management of their monetary affairs , the duty devolves on us to diminish by law the amount of paper money now in circulation . Five years ago the bank note circulation of the country amounted to not much more than two hundred millions now the circulation , bank and national , exceeds seven hundred millions . The simple statement of the fact recommends more strongly than any words of mine could do the necessity of our restraining this expansion . The gradual reduction of the currency is the only measure that can save the business of the country from disastrous calamities , and this can be almost imperceptibly accomplished by gradually funding the national circulation in securities that may be made redeemable at the pleasure of the Government . Our debt is doubly secure first in the actual wealth and still greater undeveloped resources of the country , and next in the character of our institutions . The most intelligent observers among political economists have not failed to remark that the public debt of a country is safe in proportion as its people are free that the debt of a republic is the safest of all . Our history confirms and establishes the theory , and is , I firmly believe , destined to give it a still more signal illustration . The secret of this superiority springs not merely from the fact that in a republic the national obligations are distributed more widely through countless numbers in all classes of society it has its root in the character of our laws . Here all men contribute to the public welfare and bear their fair share of the public burdens . During the war , under the impulses of patriotism , the men of the great body of the people , without regard to their own comparative want of wealth , thronged to our armies and filled our fleets of war , and held themselves ready to offer their lives for the public good . Now , in their turn , the property and income of the country should bear their just proportion of the burden of taxation , while in our impost system , through means of which increased vitality is incidentally imparted to all the industrial interests of the nation , the duties should be so adjusted as to fall most heavily on articles of luxury leaving the necessaries of life as free from taxation as the absolute wants of the Government economically administered will justify . No favored class should demand freedom from assessment , and the taxes should be so distributed as not to fall unduly on the poor , but rather on the accumulated wealth of the country . We should look at the national debt just as it is not as a national blessing , but as a heavy burden on the industry of the country , to be discharged without unnecessary delay . It is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury that the expenditures for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June , 1866 , will exceed the receipts 112 , 194 , 947 . It is gratifying , however , to state that it is also estimated that the revenue for the year ending the 30th of June , 1867 , will exceed the expenditures in the sum of 111 , 682 , 818 . This amount , or so much as may be deemed sufficient for the purpose , may be applied to the reduction of the public debt , which on the 31st day of October , 1865 , was 2 , 740 , 854 , 750 . Every reduction will diminish the total amount of interest to be paid , and so enlarge the means of still further reductions , until the whole shall be liquidated and this , as will be seen from the estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury , may be accomplished by annual payments even within a period not exceeding thirty years . I have faith that we shall do all this within a reasonable time that as we have amazed the world by the suppression of a civil war which was thought to be beyond the control of any government , so we shall equally show the superiority of our institutions by the prompt and faithful discharge of our national obligations . The Department of Agriculture under its present direction is accomplishing much in developing and utilizing the vast agricultural capabilities of the country , and for information respecting the details of its management reference is made to the annual report of the Commissioner . I have dwelt thus fully on our domestic affairs because of their transcendent importance . Under any circumstances our great extent of territory and variety of climate , producing almost everything that is necessary for the wants and even the comforts of man , make us singularly independent of the varying policy of foreign powers and protect us against every temptation to entangling alliances , while at the present moment the reestablishment of harmony and the strength that comes from harmony will be our best security against nations who feel power and forget right . For myself , it has been and it will be my constant aim to promote peace and amity with all foreign nations and powers , and I have every reason to believe that they all , without exception , are animated by the same disposition . Our relations with the Emperor of China , so recent in their origin , are most friendly . Our commerce with his dominions is receiving new developments , and it is very pleasing to find that the Government of that great Empire manifests satisfaction with our policy and reposes just confidence in the fairness which marks our intercourse . The unbroken harmony between the United States and the Emperor of Russia is receiving a new support from an enterprise designed to carry telegraphic lines across the continent of Asia , through his dominions , and so to connect us with all Europe by a new channel of intercourse . Our commerce with South America is about to receive encouragement by a direct line of mail steamships to the rising Empire of Brazil . The distinguished party of men of science who have recently left our country to make a scientific exploration of the natural history and rivers and mountain ranges of that region have received from the Emperor that generous welcome which was to have been expected from his constant friendship for the United States and his well known zeal in promoting the advancement of knowledge . A hope is entertained that our commerce with the rich and populous countries that border the Mediterranean Sea may be largely increased . Nothing will be wanting on the part of this Government to extend the protection of our flag over the enterprise of our fellow citizens . We receive from the powers in that region assurances of good will and it is worthy of note that a special envoy has brought us messages of condolence on the death of our late Chief Magistrate from the Bey of Tunis , whose rule includes the old dominions of Carthage , on the African coast . Our domestic contest , now happily ended , has left some traces in our relations with one at least of the great maritime powers . The formal accordance of belligerent rights to the insurgent States was unprecedented , and has not been justified by the issue . But in the systems of neutrality pursued by the powers which made that concession there was a marked difference . The materials of war for the insurgent States were furnished , in a great measure , from the workshops of Great Britain , and British ships , manned by British subjects and prepared for receiving British armaments , sallied from the ports of Great Britain to make war on American commerce under the shelter of a commission from the insurgent States . These ships , having once escaped from British ports , ever afterwards entered them in every part of the world to refit , and so to renew their depredations . The consequences of this conduct were most disastrous to the States then in rebellion , increasing their desolation and misery by the prolongation of our civil contest . It had , moreover , the effect , to a great extent , to drive the American flag from the sea , and to transfer much of our shipping and our commerce to the very power whose subjects had created the necessity for such a change . These events took place before I was called to the administration of the Government . The sincere desire for peace by which I am animated led me to approve the proposal , already made , to submit the question which had thus arisen between the countries to arbitration . These questions are of such moment that they must have commanded the attention of the great powers , and are so interwoven with the peace and interests of every one of them as to have insured an impartial decision . I regret to inform you that Great Britain declined the arbitrament , but , on the other hand , invited us to the formation of a joint commission to settle mutual claims between the two countries , from which those for the depredations before mentioned should be excluded . The proposition , in that very unsatisfactory form , has been declined . The United States did not present the subject as an impeachment of the good faith of a power which was professing the most friendly dispositions , but as involving questions of public law of which the settlement is essential to the peace of nations and though pecuniary reparation to their injured citizens would have followed incidentally on a decision against Great Britain , such compensation was not their primary object . They had a higher motive , and it was in the interests of peace and justice to establish important principles of international law . The correspondence will be placed before you . The ground on which the British minister rests his justification is , substantially , that the municipal law of a nation and the domestic interpretations of that law are the measure of its duty as a neutral , and I feel bound to declare my opinion before you and before the world that that justification can not be sustained before the tribunal of nations . At the same time I do not advise to any present attempt at redress by acts of legislation . For the future , friendship between the two countries must rest on the basis of mutual justice . From the moment of the establishment of our free Constitution the civilized world has been convulsed by revolutions in the interests of democracy or of monarchy , but through all those revolutions the United States have wisely and firmly refused to become propagandists of republicanism . It is the only government suited to our condition but we have never sought to impose it on others , and we have consistently followed the advice of Washington to recommend it only by the careful preservation and prudent use of the blessing . During all the intervening period the policy of European powers and of the United States has , on the whole , been harmonious . Twice , indeed , rumors of the invasion of some parts of America in the interest of monarchy have prevailed twice my predecessors have had occasion to announce the views of this nation in respect to such interference . On both occasions the remonstrance of the United States was respected from a deep conviction on the part of European Governments that the system of noninterference and mutual abstinence from propagandism was the true rule for the two hemispheres . Since those times we have advanced in wealth and power , but we retain the same purpose to leave the nations of Europe to choose their own dynasties and form their own systems of government . This consistent moderation may justly demand a corresponding moderation . We should regard it as a great calamity to ourselves , to the cause of good government , and to the peace of the world should any European power challenge the American people , as it were , to the defense of republicanism against foreign interference . We can not foresee and are unwilling to consider what opportunities might present themselves , what combinations might offer to protect ourselves against designs inimical to our form of government . The United States desire to act in the future as they have ever acted heretofore they never will be driven from that course but by the aggression of European powers , and we rely on the wisdom and justice of those powers to respect the system of noninterference which has so long been sanctioned by time , and which by its good results has approved itself to both continents . The correspondence between the United States and France in reference to questions which have become subjects of discussion between the two Governments will at a proper time be laid before Congress . When , on the organization of our Government under the Constitution , the President of the United States delivered his inaugural address to the two Houses of Congress , he said to them , and through them to the country and to mankind , that The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered , perhaps , as deeply , as finally , staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people . And the House of Representatives answered Washington by the voice of Madison We adore the Invisible Hand which has led the American people , through so many difficulties , to cherish a conscious responsibility for the destiny of republican liberty . More than seventy six years have glided away since these words were spoken the United States have passed through severer trials than were foreseen and now , at this new epoch in our existence as one nation , with our Union purified by sorrows and strengthened by conflict and established by the virtue of the people , the greatness of the occasion invites us once more to repeat with solemnity the pledges of our fathers to hold ourselves answerable before our fellow men for the success of the republican form of government . Experience has proved its sufficiency in peace and in war it has vindicated its authority through dangers and afflictions , and sudden and terrible emergencies , which would have crushed any system that had been less firmly fixed in the hearts of the people . At the inauguration of Washington the foreign relations of the country were few and its trade was repressed by hostile regulations now all the civilized nations of the globe welcome our commerce , and their governments profess toward us amity . Then our country felt its way hesitatingly along an untried path , with States so little bound together by rapid means of communication as to be hardly known to one another , and with historic traditions extending over very few years now intercourse between the States is swift and intimate the experience of centuries has been crowded into a few generations , and has created an intense , indestructible nationality . Then our jurisdiction did not reach beyond the inconvenient boundaries of the territory which had achieved independence now , through cessions of lands , first colonized by Spain and France , the country has acquired a more complex character , and has for its natural limits the chain of lakes , the Gulf of Mexico , and on the east and the west the two great oceans . Other nations were wasted by civil wars for ages before they could establish for themselves the necessary degree of unity the latent conviction that our form of government is the best ever known to the world has enabled us to emerge from civil war within four years with a complete vindication of the constitutional authority of the General Government and with our local liberties and State institutions unimpaired . The throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores are witnesses of the confidence of all peoples in our permanence . Here is the great land of free labor , where industry is blessed with unexampled rewards and the bread of the workingman is sweetened by the consciousness that the cause of the country is his own cause , his own safety , his own dignity . Here everyone enjoys the free use of his faculties and the choice of activity as a natural right . Here , under the combined influence of a fruitful soil , genial climes , and happy institutions , population has increased fifteen fold within a century . Here , through the easy development of boundless resources , wealth has increased with twofold greater rapidity than numbers , so that we have become secure against the financial vicissitudes of other countries and , alike in business and in opinion , are self centered and truly independent . Here more and more care is given to provide education for everyone born on our soil . Here religion , released from political connection with the civil government , refuses to subserve the craft of statesmen , and becomes in its independence the spiritual life of the people . Here toleration is extended to every opinion , in the quiet certainty that truth needs only a fair field to secure the victory . Here the human mind goes forth unshackled in the pursuit of science , to collect stores of knowledge and acquire an ever increasing mastery over the forces of nature . Here the national domain is offered and held in millions of separate freeholds , so that our fellow citizens , beyond the occupants of any other part of the earth , constitute in reality a people . Here exists the democratic form of government and that form of government , by the confession of European statesmen , gives a power of which no other form is capable , because it incorporates every man with the state and arouses everything that belongs to the soul . Where in past history . does a parallel exist to the public happiness which is within the reach of the people of the United States Where in any part of the globe can institutions be found so suited to their habits or so entitled to their love as their own free Constitution Every one of them , then , in whatever part of the land he has his home , must wish its perpetuity . Who of them will not now acknowledge , in the words of Washington , that every step by which the people of the United States have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency Who will not join with me in the prayer that the Invisible Hand which has led us through the clouds that gloomed around our path will so guide us onward to a perfect restoration of fraternal affection that we of this day may be able to transmit our great inheritance of State governments in all their rights , of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor , to our posterity , and they to theirs through countless generations<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I have given to the joint resolution entitled A resolution excluding from the electoral college the votes of States lately in rebellion which shall not have been reorganized as careful examination as I have been able to bestow upon the subject during the few days that have intervened since the measure was submitted for my approval . Feeling constrained to withhold my consent , I herewith return the resolution to the Senate , in which House it originated , with a brief statement of the reasons which have induced my action . This joint resolution is based upon the assumption that some of the States whose inhabitants were lately in rebellion are not now entitled to representation in Congress and participation in the election of President and Vice President of the United States . Having heretofore had occasion to give in detail my reasons for dissenting from this view , it is not necessary at this time to repeat them . It is sufficient to state that I continue strong in my conviction that the acts of secession , by which a number of the States sought to dissolve their connection with the other States and to subvert the Union , being unauthorized by the Constitution and in direct violation thereof , were from the beginning absolutely null and void . It follows necessarily that when the rebellion terminated the several States which had attempted to secede continued to be States in the Union , and all that was required to enable them to resume their relations to the Union was that they should adopt the measures necessary to their practical restoration as States . Such measures were adopted , and the legitimate result was that those States , having conformed to all the requirements of the Constitution , resumed their former relations , and became entitled to the exercise of all the rights guaranteed to them by its provisions . The joint resolution under consideration , however , seems to assume that by the insurrectionary acts of their respective inhabitants those States forfeited their rights as such , and can never again exercise them except upon readmission into the Union on the terms prescribed by Congress . If this position be correct , it follows that they were taken out of the Union by virtue of their acts of secession , and hence that the war waged upon them was illegal and unconstitutional . We would thus be placed in this inconsistent attitude , that while the war was commenced and carried on upon the distinct ground that the Southern States , being component parts of the Union , were in rebellion against the lawful authority of the United States , upon its termination we resort to a policy of reconstruction which assumes that it was not in fact a rebellion , but that the war was waged for the conquest of territories assumed to be outside of the constitutional Union . The mode and manner of receiving and counting the electoral votes for President and Vice President of the United States are in plain and simple terms prescribed by the Constitution . That instrument imperatively requires that the President of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . Congress has , therefore , no power , under the Constitution , to receive the electoral votes or reject them . The whole power is exhausted when , in the presence of the two Houses , the votes are counted and the result declared . In this respect the power and duty of the President of the Senate are , under the Constitution , purely ministerial . When , therefore , the joint resolution declares that no electoral votes shall be received or counted from States that since the 4th of March , 1867 , have not adopted a constitution of State government under which a State government shall have organized , a power is assumed which is nowhere delegated to Congress , unless upon the assumption that the State governments organized prior to the 4th of March , 1867 , were illegal and void . The joint resolution , by implication at least , concedes that these States were States by virtue of their organization prior to the 4th of March , 1867 , but denies to them the right to vote in the election of President and Vice President of the United States . It follows either that this assumption of power is wholly unauthorized by the Constitution or that the States so excluded from voting were out of the Union by reason of the rebellion , and have never been legitimately restored . Being fully satisfied that they were never out of the Union , and that their relations thereto have been legally and constitutionally restored , I am forced to the conclusion that the joint resolution , which deprives them of the right to have their votes for President and Vice President received and counted , is in conflict with the Constitution , and that Congress has no more power to reject their votes than those of the States which have been uniformly loyal to the Federal Union . It is worthy of remark that if the States whose inhabitants were recently in rebellion were legally and constitutionally organized and restored to their rights prior to the 4th of March , 1867 , as I am satisfied they were , the only legitimate authority under which the election for President and Vice President can be held therein must be derived from the governments instituted before that period . It clearly follows that all the State governments organized in those States under act of Congress for that purpose , and under military control , are illegitimate and of no validity whatever and in that view the votes cast in those States for President and Vice President , in pursuance of acts passed since the 4th of March , 1867 , and in obedience to the so called reconstruction acts of Congress , can not be legally received and counted , while the only votes in those States that can be legally cast and counted will be those cast in pursuance of the laws in force in the several States prior to the legislation by Congress upon the subject of reconstruction . I can not refrain from directing your special attention to the declaration contained in the joint resolution , that none of the States whose inhabitants were lately in rebellion shall be entitled to representation in the electoral college , etc . If it is meant by this declaration that no State is to be allowed to vote for President and Vice President all of whose inhabitants were engaged in the late rebellion , it is apparent that no one of the States will be excluded from voting , since it is well known that in every Southern State there were many inhabitants who not only did not participate m the rebellion , but who actually took part in the suppression , or refrained from giving it any aid or countenance . I therefore conclude that the true meaning of the joint resolution is that no State a portion of whose inhabitants were engaged in the rebellion shall be permitted to participate in the Presidential election , except upon the terms and conditions therein prescribed . Assuming this to be the true construction of the resolution , the inquiry becomes pertinent , May those Northern States a portion of whose inhabitants were actually in the rebellion be prevented , at the discretion of Congress from having their electoral votes counted It is well known that a portion of the inhabitants of New York and a portion of the inhabitants of Virginia were alike engaged in the rebellion yet it is equally well known that Virginia , as well as New York , was at all times during the war recognized by the Federal Government as a State in the Union so clearly that upon the termination of hostilities it was not even deemed necessary for her restoration that a provisional governor should be appointed yet , according to this joint resolution , the people of Virginia , unless they comply with the terms it prescribes , are denied the right of voting for President , while the people of New York , a portion of the inhabitants of which State were also in rebellion , are permitted to have their electoral votes counted without undergoing the process of reconstruction prescribed for Virginia . New York is no more a State than Virginia the one is as much entitled to representation in the electoral college as the other . If Congress has the power to deprive Virginia of this right , it can exercise the same authority with respect to New York or any other of the States . Thus the result of the Presidential election may be controlled and determined by Congress , and the people be deprived of their right under the Constitution to choose a President and Vice President of the United States . If Congress were to provide by law that the votes of none of the States should be received and counted if cast for a candidate who differed in political sentiment with a majority of the two Houses , such legislation would at once be condemned by the country as an unconstitutional and revolutionary usurpation of power . It would , however , be exceedingly difficult to find in the Constitution any more authority for the passage of the joint resolution under consideration than for an enactment looking directly to the rejection of all votes not in accordance with the political preferences of a majority of Congress . No power exists in the Constitution authorizing the joint resolution or the supposed law the only difference being that one would be more palpably unconstitutional and revolutionary than the other . Both would rest upon the radical error that Congress has the power to prescribe terms and conditions to the right of the people of the States to cast their votes for President and Vice President . For the reasons thus indicated I am constrained to return the joint resolution to the Senate for such further action thereon as Congress may deem necessary .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Whereas by proclamations of the 15th and 19th of April , 1861 , the President of the United States , in virtue of the power vested in him by the Constitution and the laws , declared that the laws of the United States were opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in the States of South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , Florida , Mississippi , Louisiana , and Texas by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals by law and Whereas by another proclamation , made on the 16th day of August , in the same year , in pursuance of an act of Congress approved July 13 , 1861 , the inhabitants of the States of Georgia , South Carolina , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Alabama , Louisiana , Texas , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Florida except the inhabitants of that part of the State of Virginia lying west of the Alleghany Mountains and of such other parts of that State and the other States before named as might maintain a loyal adhesion to the Union and the Constitution or might be from time to time occupied and controlled by forces of the United States engaged in the dispersion of insurgents were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the United States and Whereas by another proclamation , of the 1st day of July , 1862 , issued in pursuance of an act of Congress approved June 7 , in the same year , the insurrection was declared to be still existing in the States aforesaid , with the exception of certain specified counties in the State of Virginia and Whereas by another proclamation , made on the 2d , day of April , 1863 , in pursuance of the act of Congress of July 13 , 1861 , the exceptions named in the proclamation of August 16 , 1861 , were revoked and the inhabitants of the States of Georgia , South Carolina , North Carolina , Tennessee , Alabama , Louisiana , Texas , Arkansas , Mississippi , Florida , and Virginia except the forty eight counties of Virginia designated as West Virginia and the ports of New Orleans , Key West , Port Royal , and Beaufort , in North Carolina were declared to be still in a state of insurrection against the United States and Whereas the House of Representatives , on the 22d day of July , 1861 , adopted a resolution in the words following , namely Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States , That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the dis unionists of the Southern States now in revolt against the constitutional Government and in arms around the capital that in this national emergency Congress , banishing all feelings of mere passion or resentment , will recollect only its duty to the whole country that this war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression , nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation . nor purpose of overthrowing interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve the Union , with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the several States unimpaired and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease . And whereas the Senate of the United States , on the 25th day of July . 1861 , adopted a resolution in the words following , to wit Resolved , That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the Southern States now in revolt against the constitutional Government and in arms around the capital that in this national emergency Congress , banishing all feeling of mere passion or resentment , will recollect only its duty to the whole country that this war is not prosecuted upon our part in any spirit of oppression , nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation , nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof and to preserve the Union , with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the several States unimpaired that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease . And whereas these resolutions , though not joint or concurrent in form , are substantially identical , and as such may be regarded as having expressed the sense of Congress upon the subject to which they relate and Whereas by my proclamation of the 13th day of June last the insurrection in the State of Tennessee was declared to have been suppressed , the authority of the United States therein to be undisputed , and such United States officers as had been duly commissioned to be in the undisturbed exercise of their official functions and Whereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided citizens or others to the authority of the United States in the States of Georgia , South Carolina , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Alabama , Louisiana , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Florida , and the laws can be sustained and enforced therein by the proper civil authority , State or Federal , and the people of said States are well and loyally disposed and have conformed or will conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States and Whereas , in view of the before recited premises , it is the manifest determination of the American people that no State of its own will has the right or the power to go out of , or separate itself from , or be separated from , the American Union , and that therefore each State ought to remain and constitute an integral part of the United States and Whereas the people of the several before mentioned States have , in the manner aforesaid , given satisfactory evidence that they acquiesce in this sovereign and important resolution of national unity and Whereas it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that people who have revolted and who have been overcome and subdued must either be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily to become friends or else they must be held by absolute military power or devastated so as to prevent them from ever again doing harm as enemies , which last named policy is abhorrent to humanity and to freedom and Whereas the Constitution of the United States provides for constituent communities only as States , and not as Territories , dependencies , provinces , or protectorates and Whereas such constituent States must necessarily be , and by the Constitution and laws of the United States are , made equals and placed upon a like footing as to political rights , immunities , dignity , and power with the several States with which they are united and Whereas the observance of political equality , as a principle of right and justice , is well calculated to encourage the people of the aforesaid States to be and become more and more constant and persevering in their renewed allegiance and Whereas standing armies , military occupation , martial law , military tribunals , and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus are in time of peace dangerous to public liberty , incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen , contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions , and exhaustive of the national resources , and ought not , therefore , to be sanctioned or allowed except in cases of actual necessity for repelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion and Whereas the policy of the Government of the United States from the beginning of the insurrection to its overthrow and final suppression has been in conformity with the principles herein set forth and enumerated Now , therefore , Andrew Johnson , President of the United States , do hereby proclaim and declare that the insurrection which heretofore existed in the States of Georgia , South Carolina , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Alabama , Louisiana , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Florida is at an end and is henceforth to be so regarded . In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , this 2d day of April , 1866 , and of the Independence of the United States of America the ninetieth . ANDREW JOHNSON . By the President WILLIAM SEWARD , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>
