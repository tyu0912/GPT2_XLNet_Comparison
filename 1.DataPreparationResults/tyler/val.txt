To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States . FELLOW CITIZENYou have been assembled in your respective halls of legislation under a proclamation bearing the signature of the illustrious citizen who was so lately called by the direct suffrages of the people to the discharge of the important functions of their chief executive office . Upon the expiration of a single month from the day of his installation he has paid the great debt of nature , leaving behind him a name associated with the recollection of numerous benefits conferred upon the country during a long life of patriotic devotion . With this public bereavement are connected other considerations which will not escape the attention of Congress . The preparations necessary for his removal to the seat of Government in view of a residence of four years must have devolved upon the late President heavy expenditures , which , if permitted to burthen the limited resources of his private fortune , may tend seriously to the embarrassment of his surviving family and it is therefore respectfully submitted to Congress whether the ordinary principles of justice would not dictate the propriety of its legislative interposition . By the provisions of the fundamental law the powers and duties of the high station to which he was elected have devolved upon me , and in the dispositions of the representatives of the States and of the people will be found , to a great extent , a solution of the problem to which our institutions are for the first time subjected . In entering upon the duties of this office I did not feel that it would be becoming in me to disturb what had been ordered by my lamented predecessor . Whatever , therefore , may have been my opinion originally as to the propriety of convening Congress at so early a day from that of its late adjournment , I found a new and controlling inducement not to interfere with the patriotic desires of the late President in the novelty of the situation in which I was so unexpectedly placed . My first wish under such circumstances would necessarily have been to have called to my aid in the administration of public affairs the combined wisdom of the two Houses of Congress , in order to take their counsel and advice as to the best mode of extricating the Government and the country from the embarrassments weighing heavily on both . I am , then , most happy in finding myself so soon after my accession to the Presidency surrounded by the immediate representatives of the States and people . No important changes having taken place in our foreign relations since the last session of Congress , it is not deemed necessary on this occasion to go into a detailed statement in regard to them . I am happy to say that I see nothing to destroy the hope of being able to preserve peace . The ratification of the treaty with Portugal has been duly exchanged between the two Governments . This Government has not been inattentive to the interests of those of our citizens who have claims on the Government of Spain rounded on express treaty stipulations , and a hope is indulged that the representations which have been made to that Government on this subject may lead ere long to beneficial results . A correspondence has taken place between the Secretary of State and the minister of Her Britannic Majesty accredited to this Government on the subject of Alexander McLeod s indictment and imprisonment , copies of which are herewith communicated to Congress . In addition to what appears from these papers , it may be proper to state that Alexander McLeod has been heard by the supreme court of the State of New York on his motion to be discharged from imprisonment , and that the decision of that court has not as yet been pronounced . The Secretary of State has addressed to me a paper upon two subjects interesting to the commerce of the country , which will receive my consideration , and which I have the honor to communicate to Congress . So far as it depends on the course of this Government , our relations of good will and friendship will be sedulously cultivated with all nations . The true American policy will be found to consist in the exercise of a spirit of justice , to be manifested in the discharge of all our international obligations to the weakest of the family of nations as well as to the most powerful . Occasional conflicts of opinion may arise , but when the discussions incident to them are conducted in the language of truth and with a strict regard to justice the scourge of war will for the most part be avoided . The time ought to be regarded as having gone by when a resort to arms is to be esteemed as the only proper arbiter of national differences . The census recently taken shows a regularly progressive increase in our population . Upon the breaking out of the War of the Revolution our numbers scarcely equaled 3 , 000 , 000 souls they already exceed 17 , 000 , 000 , and will continue to progress in a ratio which duplicates in a period of about twenty three years . The old States contain a territory sufficient in itself to maintain a population of additional millions , and the most populous of the new States may even yet be regarded as but partially settled , while of the new lands on this side of the Rocky Mountains , to say nothing of the immense region which stretches from the base of those mountains to the mouth of the Columbia River , about 770 , 000 , 000 acres , ceded and unceded , still remain to be brought into market . We hold out to the people of other countries an invitation to come and settle among us as members of our rapidly growing family , and for the blessings which we offer them we require of them to look upon our country as their country and to unite with us in the great task of preserving our institutions and thereby perpetuating our liberties . No motive exists for foreign conquest we desire but to reclaim our almost illimitable wildernesses and to introduce into their depths the lights of civilization . While we shall at all times be prepared to vindicate the national honor , our most earnest desire will be to maintain an unbroken peace . In presenting the foregoing views I can not withhold the expression of the opinion that there exists nothing in the extension of our Empire over our acknowledged possessions to excite the alarm of the patriot for the safety of our institutions . The federative system , leaving to each State the care of its domestic concerns and devolving on the Federal Government those of general import , admits in safety of the greatest expansion but at the same time I deem it proper to add that there will be found to exist at all times an imperious necessity for restraining all the functionaries of this Government within the range of their respective powers , thereby preserving a just balance between the powers granted to this Government and those reserved to the States and to the people . From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will perceive that the fiscal means , present and accruing , are insufficient to supply the wants of the Government for the current year . The balance in the Treasury on the 4th day of March last not covered by outstanding drafts , and exclusive of trust funds , is estimated at 860 , 000 . This includes the sum of 215 , 000 deposited in the Mint and its branches to procure metal for coining and in process of coinage , and which could not be withdrawn without inconvenience , thus leaving subject to draft in the various depositories the sum of 645 , 000 . By virtue of two several acts of Congress the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to issue on and after the 4th day of March last Treasury notes to the amount of 5 , 413 , 000 , making an aggregate available fund of 6 , 058 , 000 on hand . But this fund was chargeable , with outstanding Treasury notes redeemable in the current year and interest thereon , to the estimated amount of 5 , 280 , 000 . There is also thrown upon the Treasury the payment of a large amount of demands accrued in whole or in part in former years , which will exhaust the available means of the Treasury and leave the accruing revenue , reduced as it is in amount , burthened with debt and charged with the current expenses of the Government . The aggregate amount of outstanding appropriations on the 4th day of March last was 33 , 429 , 616 . 50 , of which 24 , 210 , 000 will be required during the current year and there will also be required for the use of the War Department additional appropriations to the amount of 2 , 511 , 132 . 98 , the special objects of which will be seen by reference to the report of the Secretary of War . The anticipated means of the Treasury are greatly inadequate to this demand . The receipts from customs for the last three quarters of the last year and first quarter of the present year amounted to 12 , 100 , 000 the receipts for lands for the same time to 2 , 742 , 450 , shewing an average revenue from both sources of 1 , 236 , 870 per month . A gradual expansion of trade , growing out of a restoration of confidence , together with a reduction in the expenses of collecting and punctuality on the part of collecting officers , may cause an addition to the monthly receipts from the customs . They are estimated for the residue of the year from the 4th of March at 12 , 000 , 000 . The receipts from the public lands for the same time are estimated at 2 , 500 , 000 , and from miscellaneous sources at 12 , 000 , 000 , making an aggregate of available fund within the year of 15 , 315 , 000 which will leave a probable deficit of 11 , 406 , 132 . 98 . To meet this some temporary provision is necessary until the amount can be absorbed by the excess of revenues which are anticipated to accrue at no distant day . There will fall due within the next three months Treasury notes of the issues of 1840 , including interest , about 2 , 850 , 000 There is chargeable in the same period for arrearages for taking the Sixth Census 294 , 000 , and the estimated expenditures for the current service are about 8 , 100 , 000 , making the aggregate demand upon the Treasury prior to the 1st of September next about 11 , 340 , 000 . The ways and means in the Treasury and estimated to accrue within the above named period consist of about 694 , 000 of funds available on the 28th ultimo , an unissued balance of Treasury notes authorized by the act of 1841 amounting to 1 , 955 , 000 , and estimated receipts from all sources of 3 , 800 , 000 , making an aggregate of about 6 , 450 , 000 , and leaving a probable deficit on the 1st of September next of 4 , 845 , 000 . In order to supply the wants of the Government , an intelligent constituency , in view of their best interests , will without hesitation submit to all necessary burthens . But it is nevertheless important so to impose them as to avoid defeating the just expectations of the country growing out of preexisting laws . The act of the 2d of March , 1833 , commonly called the compromise act , should not be altered except under urgent necessities , which are not believed at this time to exist . One year only remains to complete the series of reductions provided for by that law , at which time provisions made by the same law , and which then will be brought actively in aid of the manufacturing interests of the Union , will not fail to produce the most beneficial results . Under a system of discriminating duties imposed for purposes of revenue , in unison with the provisions of existing laws , it is to be hoped that our policy will in the future be fixed and permanent , so as to avoid those constant fluctuations which defeat the very objects they have in view . We shall thus best maintain a position which , while it will enable us the more readily to meet the advances of other countries calculated to promote our trade and commerce , will at the same time leave in our own hands the means of retaliating with greater effect unjust regulations . In intimate connection with the question of revenue is that which makes provision for a suitable fiscal agent , capable of adding increased facilities in the collection and disbursement of the public revenues , rendering more secure their custody , and consulting a true economy in the great , multiplied , and delicate operations of the Treasury Department . Upon such an agent depends in an eminent degree the establishment of a currency of uniform value , which is of so great importance to all the essential interests of society , and on the wisdom to be manifested in its creation much depends . So intimately interwoven are its operations , not only with the interests of individuals , but of States , that it may be regarded to a great degree as controlling both . If paper be used as the chief medium of circulation , and the power be vested in the Government of issuing it at pleasure , either in the form of Treasury drafts or any other , or if banks be used as the public depositories , with liberty to regard all surpluses from day to day as so much added to their active capital , prices are exposed to constant fluctuations and industry to severe suffering . In the one case political considerations directed to party purposes may control , while excessive cupidity may prevail in the other . The public is thus constantly liable to imposition . Expansions and contractions may follow each other in rapid succession the one engendering a reckless spirit of adventure and speculation , which embraces States as well as individuals , the other causing a fall in prices and accomplishing an entire change in the aspect of affairs . Stocks of all sorts rapidly decline , individuals are ruined , and States embarrassed even in their efforts to meet with punctuality the interest on their debts . Such , unhappily , is the condition of things now existing in the United States . These effects may readily be traced to the causes above referred to . The public revenues , being removed from the then Bank of the United States , under an order of a late President , were placed in selected State banks , which , actuated by the double motive of conciliating the Government and augmenting their profits to the greatest possible extent , enlarged extravagantly their discounts , thus enabling all other existing banks to do the same large dividends were declared , which , stimulating the cupidity of capitalists , caused a rush to be made to the legislatures of the respective States for similar acts of incorporation , which by many of the States , under a temporary infatuation , were readily granted , and thus the augmentation of the circulating medium , consisting almost exclusively of paper , produced a most fatal delusion . An illustration derived from the land sales of the period alluded to will serve best to show the effect of the whole system . The average sales of the public lands for a period of ten years prior to 1834 had not much exceeded 2 , 000 , 000 per annum . In 1834 they attained in round numbers to the amount of 6 , 000 , 000 in the succeeding year of 1835 they reached 16 , 000 , 000 , and the next year of 1836 they amounted to the enormous sum of 25 , 000 , 000 , thus crowding into the short space of three years upward of twenty three years purchase of the public domain . So apparent had become the necessity of arresting this course of things that the executive department assumed the highly questionable power of discriminating in the funds to be used in payment by different classes of public debtors a discrimination which was doubtless designed to correct this most ruinous state of things by the exaction of specie in all payments for the public lands , but which could not at once arrest the tide which had so strongly set in . Hence the demands for specie became unceasing , and corresponding prostration rapidly ensued under the necessities created with the banks to curtail their discounts and thereby to reduce their circulation . I recur to these things with no disposition to censure preexisting Administrations of the Government , but simply in exemplification of the truth of the position which I have assumed . If , then , any fiscal agent which may be created shall be placed , without due restrictions , either in the hands of the administrators of the Government or those of private individuals , the temptation to abuse will prove to be resistless . Objects of political aggrandizement may seduce the first , and the promptings of a boundless cupidity will assail the last . Aided by the experience of the past , it will be the pleasure of Congress so to guard and fortify the public interests in the creation of any new agent as to place them , so far as human wisdom can accomplish it , on a footing of perfect security . Within a few years past three different schemes have been before the country . The charter of the Bank of the United States expired by its own limitations in 1836 . An effort was made to renew it , which received the sanction of the two Houses of Congress , but the then President of the United States exercised his veto power and the measure was defeated . A regard to truth requires me to say that the President was fully sustained in the course he had taken by the popular voice . His successor to the chair of state unqualifiedly pronounced his opposition to any new charter of a similar institution , and not only the popular election which brought him into power , but the elections through much of his term , seemed clearly to indicate a concurrence with him in sentiment on the part of the people . After the public moneys were withdrawn from the United States Bank they were placed in deposit with the State banks , and the result of that policy has been before the country . To say nothing as to the question whether that experiment was made under propitious or adverse circumstances , it may safely be asserted that it did receive the unqualified condemnation of most of its early advocates , and , it is believed , was also condemned by the popular sentiment . The existing subtreasury system does not seem to stand in higher favor with the people , but has recently been condemned in a manner too plainly indicated to admit of a doubt . Thus in the short period of eight years the popular voice may be regarded as having successively condemned each of the three schemes of finance to which I have adverted . As to the first , it was introduced at a time 1816 when the State banks , then comparatively few in number , had been forced to suspend specie payments by reason of the war which had previously prevailed with Great Britain . Whether if the United States Bank charter , which expired in 1811 , had been renewed in due season it would have been enabled to continue specie payments during the war and the disastrous period to the commerce of the country which immediately succeeded is , to say the least , problematical , and whether the United States Bank of 1816 produced a restoration of specie payments or the same was accomplished through the instrumentality of other means was a matter of some difficulty at that time to determine . Certain it is that for the first years of the operation of that bank its course was as disastrous as for the greater part of its subsequent career it became eminently successful . As to the second , the experiment was tried with a redundant Treasury , which continued to increase until it seemed to be the part of wisdom to distribute the surplus revenue among the States , which , operating at the same time with the specie circular and the causes before adverted to , caused them to suspend specie payments and involved the country in the greatest embarrassment . And as to the third , if carried through all the stages of its transmutation from paper and specie to nothing but the precious metals , to say nothing of the insecurity of the public moneys , its injurious effects have been anticipated by the country in its unqualified condemnation . What is now to be regarded as the judgment of the American people on this whole subject I have no accurate means of determining but by appealing to their more immediate representatives . The late contest , which terminated in the election of General Harrison to the Presidency , was decided on principles well known and openly declared , and while the subtreasury received in the result the most decided condemnation , yet no other scheme of finance seemed to have been concurred in . To you , then , who have come more directly from the body of our common constituents , I submit the entire question , as best qualified to give a full exposition of their wishes and opinions . I shall be ready to concur with you in the adoption of such system as you may propose , reserving to myself the ultimate power of rejecting any measure which may , in my view of it , conflict with the Constitution or otherwise jeopardize the prosperity of the country a power which I could not part with even if I would , but which I will not believe any act of yours will call into requisition . I can not avoid recurring , in connection with this subject , to the necessity which exists for adopting some suitable measure whereby the unlimited creation of banks by the States may be corrected in future . Such result can be most readily achieved by the consent of the States , to be expressed in the form of a compact among themselves , which they can only enter into with the consent and approbation of this Government a consent which might in the present emergency of the public demands justifiably be given by Congress in advance of any action by the States , as an inducement to such action , upon terms well defined by the act of tender . Such a measure , addressing itself to the calm reflection of the States , would find in the experience of the past and the condition of the present much to sustain it and it is greatly to be doubted whether any scheme of finance can prove for any length of time successful while the States shall continue in the unrestrained exercise of the power of creating banking corporations . This power can only be limited by their consent . With the adoption of a financial agency of a satisfactory character the hope may be indulged that the country may once more return to a state of prosperity . Measures auxiliary thereto , and in some measure inseparably connected with its success , will doubtless claim the attention of Congress . Among such , a distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands , provided such distribution does not force upon Congress the necessity of imposing upon commerce heavier burthens than those contemplated by the act of 1833 , would act as an efficient remedial measure by being brought directly in aid of the States . As one sincerely devoted to the task of preserving a just balance in our system of Government by the maintenance of the States in a condition the most free and respectable and in the full possession of all their power , I can no otherwise than feel desirous for their emancipation from the situation to which the pressure on their finances now subjects them . And while I must repudiate , as a measure founded in error and wanting constitutional sanction , the slightest approach to an assumption by this Government of the debts of the States , yet I can see in the distribution adverted too much to recommend it . The compacts between the proprietor States and this Government expressly guarantee to the States all the benefits which may arise from the sales . The mode by which this is to be effected addresses itself to the discretion of Congress as the trustee for the States , and its exercise after the most beneficial manner is restrained by nothing in the grants or in the Constitution so long as Congress shall consult that equality in the distribution which the compacts require . In the present condition of some of the States the question of distribution may be regarded as substantially a question between direct and indirect taxation . If the distribution be not made in some form or other , the necessity will daily become more urgent with the debtor States for a resort to an oppressive system of direct taxation , or their credit , and necessarily their power and influence , will be greatly diminished . The payment of taxes after the most inconvenient and oppressive mode will be exacted in place of contributions for the most part voluntarily made , and therefore comparatively unoppressive . The States are emphatically the constituents of this Government , and we should be entirely regardless of the objects held in view by them in the creation of this Government if we could be indifferent to their good . The happy effects of such a measure upon all the States would immediately be manifested . With the debtor States it would effect the relief to a great extent of the citizens from a heavy burthen of direct taxation , which presses with severity on the laboring classes , and eminently assist in restoring the general prosperity . An immediate advance would take place in the price of the State securities , and the attitude of the States would become once more , as it should ever be , lofty and erect . With States laboring under no extreme pressure from debt , the fund which they would derive from this source would enable them to improve their condition in an eminent degree . So far as this Government is concerned , appropriations to domestic objects approaching in amount the revenue derived from the land sales might be abandoned , and thus a system of unequal , and therefore unjust , legislation would be substituted by one dispensing equality to all the members of this Confederacy . Whether such distribution should be made directly to the States in the proceeds of the sales or in the form of profits by virtue of the operations of any fiscal agency having those proceeds as its basis , should such measure be contemplated by Congress , would well deserve its consideration . Nor would such disposition of the proceeds of the sales in any manner prevent Congress from time to time from passing all necessary preemption laws for the benefit of actual settlers , or from making any new arrangement as to the price of the public lands which might in future be esteemed desirable . I beg leave particularly to call your attention to the accompanying report from the Secretary of War . Besides the present state of the war which has so long afflicted the Territory of Florida , and the various other matters of interest therein referred to , you will learn from it that the Secretary has instituted an inquiry into abuses , which promises to develop gross enormities in connection with Indian treaties which have been negotiated , as well as in the expenditures for the removal and subsistence of the Indians . He represents also other irregularities of a serious nature that have grown up in the practice of the Indian Department , which will require the appropriation of upward of 200 , 000 to correct , and which claim the immediate attention of Congress . In reflecting on the proper means of defending the country we can not shut our eyes to the consequences which the introduction and use of the power of steam upon the ocean are likely to produce in wars between maritime states . We can not yet see the extent to which this power may be applied in belligerent operations , connecting itself as it does with recent improvements in the science of gunnery and projectiles but we need have no fear of being left , in regard to these things , behind the most active and skillful of other nations if the genius and enterprise of our fellow citizens receive proper encouragement and direction from Government . True wisdom would nevertheless seem to dictate the necessity of placing in perfect condition those fortifications which are designed for the protection of our principal cities and roadsteads . For the defense of our extended maritime coast our chief reliance should be placed on our Navy , aided by those inventions which are destined to recommend themselves to public adoption , but no time should be lost in placing our principal cities on the seaboard and the Lakes in a state of entire security from foreign assault . Separated as we are from the countries of the Old World , and in much unaffected by their policy , we are happily relieved from the necessity of maintaining large standing armies in times of peace . The policy which was adopted by Monroe shortly after the conclusion of the late war with Great Britain of preserving a regularly organized staff sufficient for the command of a large military force should a necessity for one arise is rounded as well in economy as in true wisdom . Provision is thus made , upon filling up the rank and file , which can readily be done on any emergency , for the introduction of a system of discipline both promptly and efficiently . All that is required in time of peace is to maintain a sufficient number of men to guard our fortifications , to meet any sudden contingency , and to encounter the first shock of war . Our chief reliance must be placed on the militia they constitute the great body of national guards , and , inspired by an ardent love of country , will be found ready at all times and at all seasons to repair with alacrity to its defense . It will be regarded by Congress , I doubt not , at a suitable time as one of its highest duties to attend to their complete organization and discipline . The state of the navy pension fund requires the immediate attention of Congress . By the operation of the act of the 3d of March , 1837 , entitled An act for the more equitable administration of the navy pension fund , that fund has been exhausted . It will be seen from the accompanying report of the Commissioner of Pensions that there will be required for the payment of navy pensions on the 1st of July next 88 , 706 . 06 1 3 , and on the 1st of January , 1842 , the sum of 69 , 000 . In addition to these sums , about 6 , 000 will be required to pay arrears of pensions which will probably be allowed between the 1st of July and the 1st of January , 1842 , making in the whole 163 , 706 . 06 1 3 . To meet these payments there is within the control of the Department the sum of 28 , 040 , leaving a deficiency of 139 , 666 . 06 1 3 . The public faith requires that immediate provision should be made for the payment of these sums . In order to introduce into the Navy a desirable efficiency , a new system of accountability may be found to be indispensably necessary . To mature a plan having for its object the accomplishment of an end so important and to meet the just expectations of the country require more time than has yet been allowed to the Secretary at the head of the Department . The hope is indulged that by the time of your next regular session measures of importance in connection with this branch of the public service may be matured for your consideration . Although the laws regulating the Post Office Department only require from the officer charged with its direction to report at the usual annual session of Congress , the Postmaster General has presented to me some facts connected with the financial condition of the Department which are deemed worthy the attention of Congress . By the accompanying report of that officer it appears the existing liabilities of that Department beyond the means of payment at its command can not be less than 500 , 000 . As the laws organizing that branch of the public service confine the expenditure to its own revenues , deficiencies therein can not be presented under the usual estimates for the expenses of Government . It must therefore be left to Congress to determine whether the moneys now due the contractors shall be paid from the public Treasury or whether that Department shall continue under its present embarrassments . It will be seen by the report of the Postmaster General that the recent lettings of contracts in several of the States have been made at such reduced rates of compensation as to encourage the belief that if the Department was relieved from existing difficulties its future operations might be conducted without any further call upon the general Treasury . The power of appointing to office is one of a character the most delicate and responsible . The appointing power is evermore exposed to be led into error . With anxious solicitude to select the most trustworthy for official station , I can not be supposed to possess a personal knowledge of the qualifications of every applicant . I deem it , therefore , proper in this most public manner to invite on the part of the Senate a just scrutiny into the character and pretensions of every person I may bring to their notice in the regular form of a nomination for office . Unless persons every way trustworthy are employed in the public service , corruption and irregularity will inevitably follow . I shall with the greatest cheerfulness acquiesce in the decision of that body , and , regarding it as wisely constituted to aid the executive department in the performance of this delicate duty , I shall look to its consent and advice as given only in furtherance of the best interests of the country . I shall also at the earliest proper occasion invite the attention of Congress to such measures as in my judgment will be best calculated to regulate and control the Executive power in reference to this vitally important subject . I shall also at the proper season invite your attention to the statutory enactments for the suppression of the slave trade , which may require to be rendered more efficient in their provisions . There is reason to believe that the traffic is on the increase . Whether such increase is to be ascribed to the abolition of slave labor in the British possessions in our vicinity and an attendant diminution in the supply of those articles which enter into the general consumption of the world , thereby augmenting the demand from other quarters , and thus calling for additional labor , it were needless to inquire . The highest considerations of public honor as well as the strongest promptings of humanity require a resort to the most vigorous efforts to suppress the trade . In conclusion I beg to invite your particular attention to the interests of this District nor do I doubt but that in a liberal spirit of legislation you will seek to advance its commercial as well as its local interests . Should Congress deem it to be its duty to repeal the existing subtreasury law , the necessity of providing a suitable place of deposit of the public moneys which may be required within the District must be apparent to all . I have felt it due to the country to present the foregoing topics to your consideration and reflection . Others with which it might not seem proper to trouble you at an extraordinary session will be laid before you at a future day . I am happy in committing the important affairs of the country into your hands . The tendency of public sentiment , I am pleased to believe , is toward the adoption , in a spirit of union and harmony , of such measures as will fortify the public interests . To cherish such a tendency of public opinion is the task of an elevated patriotism . That differences of opinion as to the means of accomplishing these desirable objects should exist is reasonably to be expected . Nor can all be made satisfied with any system of measures but I flatter myself with the hope that the great body of the people will readily unite in support of those whose efforts spring from a disinterested desire to promote their happiness , to preserve the Federal and State Governments within their respective orbits to cultivate peace with all the nations of the earth on just and honorable grounds to exact obedience to the laws to intrench liberty and property in full security and , consulting the most rigid economy , to abolish all useless expenses .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States I communicate herewith to Congress copies of a correspondence which has recently taken place between certain agents of the Government of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands and the Secretary of State . The condition of those islands has excited a good deal of interest , which is increasing by every successive proof that their inhabitants are making progress in civilization and becoming more and more competent to maintain regular and orderly civil government . They lie in the Pacific Ocean , much nearer to this continent than the other , and have become an important place for the refitment and provisioning of American and European vessels . Owing to their locality and to the course of the winds which prevail in this quarter of the world , the Sandwich Islands are the stopping place for almost all vessels passing from continent to continent across the Pacific Ocean . They are especially resorted to by the great number of vessels of the United States which are , engaged in the whale fishery in those seas . The number of vessels of all sorts and the amount of property owned by citizens of the United States which are found in those islands in the course of the year are stated probably with sufficient accuracy in the letter of the agents . Just emerging from a state of barbarism , the Government of the islands is as yet feeble , but its dispositions appear to be just and pacific , and it seems anxious to improve the condition of its people by the introduction of knowledge , of religious and moral institutions , means of education , and the arts of civilized life . It can not but be in conformity with the interest and wishes of the Government and the people of the United States that this community , thus existing in the midst of a vast expanse of ocean , should be respected and all its rights strictly and conscientiously regarded and this must also be the true interest of all other commercial states . Far remote from the dominions of European powers , its growth and prosperity as an independent state may yet be in a high degree useful to all whose trade is extended to those regions while its near approach to this continent and the intercourse which American vessels have with it , such vessels constituting five sixths of all which annually visit it , could not but create dissatisfaction on the part of the United States at any attempt by another power , should such attempt be threatened or feared , to take possession of the islands , colonize them , and subvert the native Government . Considering , therefore , that the United States possesses so large a share of the intercourse with those islands , it is deemed not unfit to make the declaration that their Government seeks , nevertheless , no peculiar advantages , no exclusive control over the Hawaiian Government , but is content with its independent existence and anxiously wishes for its security and prosperity . Its forbearance in this respect under the circumstances of the very large intercourse of their citizens with the islands would justify this Government , should events hereafter arise to require it , in making a decided remonstrance against the adoption of an opposite policy by any other power . Under the circumstances I recommend to Congress to provide for a moderate allowance to be made out of the Treasury to the consul residing there , that in a Government so new and a country so remote American citizens may have respectable authority to which to apply for redress in case of injury to their persons and property , and to whom the Government of the country may also make known any acts committed by American citizens of which it may think it has a right to complain . Events of considerable importance have recently transpired in China . The military operations carried on against that Empire by the English Government have been terminated by a treaty , according to the terms of which four important ports hitherto shut against foreign commerce are to be open to British merchants , viz , Amoy , Foo Choo Foo , Ningpo , and Chinghai . It can not but be interesting to the mercantile interest of the United States , whose intercourse with China at the single port of Canton has already become so considerable , to ascertain whether these other ports now open to British commerce are to remain shut , nevertheless , against the commerce of the United States . The treaty between the Chinese Government and the British commissioner provides neither for the admission nor the exclusion of the ships of other nations . It would seem , therefore , that it remains with every other nation having commercial intercourse with China to seek to make proper arrangements for itself with the Government of that Empire in this respect . The importations into the United States from China are known to be large , having amounted in some years , as will be seen by the annexed tables , to 9 , 000 , 000 . The exports , too , from the United States to China constitute an interesting and growing part of the commerce of the country . It appears that in the year 1841 , in the direct trade between the two countries , the value of the exports from the United States amounted to 715 , 000 in domestic produce and 485 , 000 in foreign merchandise . But the whole amount of American produce which finally reaches China and is there consumed is not comprised in these tables , which show only the direct trade . Many vessels with American products on board sail with a primary destination to other countries , but ultimately dispose of more or less of their cargoes in the port of Canton . The peculiarities of the Chinese Government and the Chinese character are well known . An Empire supposed to contain 300 , 000 , 000 subjects , fertile in various rich products of the earth , not without the knowledge of letters and of many arts , and with large and expensive accommodations for internal intercourse and traffic , has for ages sought to exclude the visits of strangers and foreigners from its dominions , and has assumed for itself a superiority over all other nations . Events appear likely to break down and soften this spirit of nonintercourse and to bring China ere long into the relations which usually subsist between civilized states . She has agreed in the treaty with England that correspondence between the agents of the two Governments shall be on equal terms a concession which it is hardly probable will hereafter be withheld from other nations . It is true that the cheapness of labor among the Chinese , their ingenuity in its application , and the fixed character of their habits and pursuits may discourage the hope of the opening of any great and sudden demand for the fabrics of other countries . But experience proves that the productions of western nations find a market to some extent among the Chinese that that market , so far as respects the productions of the United States , although it has considerably varied in successive seasons , has on the whole more than doubled within the last ten years and it can hardly be doubted that the opening of several new and important ports connected with parts of the Empire heretofore seldom visited by Europeans or Americans would exercise a favorable influence upon the demand for such productions . It is not understood that the immediate establishment of correspondent embassies and missions or the permanent residence of diplomatic functionaries with full powers of each country at the Court of the other is contemplated between England and China , although , as has been already observed , it has been stipulated that intercourse between the two countries shall hereafter be on equal terms . An ambassador or envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary can only be accredited , according to the usages of western nations , to the head or sovereign of the state , and it may be doubtful whether the Court of Pekin is yet prepared to conform to these usages so far as to receive a minister plenipotentiary to reside near it . Being of opinion , however , that the commercial interests of the United States connected with China require at the present moment a degree of attention and vigilance such as there is no agent of this Government on the spot to bestow , I recommend to Congress to make appropriation for the compensation of a commissioner to reside in China to exercise a watchful care over the concerns of American citizens and for the protection of their persons and property , empowered to hold intercourse with the local authorities , and ready , under instructions from his Government , should such instructions become necessary and proper hereafter , to address himself to the high functionaries of the Empire , or through them to the Emperor himself . It will not escape the observation of Congress that in order to secure the important object of any such measure a citizen of much intelligence and weight of character should be employed on such agency , and that to secure the services of such an individual a compensation should be made corresponding with the magnitude and importance of the mission .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States The bill entitled An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank of the United States , which originated in the Senate , has been considered by me with a sincere desire to conform my action in regard to it to that of the two Houses of Congress . By the Constitution it is made my duty either to approve the bill by signing it or to return it with my objections to the House in which it originated . I can not conscientiously give it my approval , and I proceed to discharge the duty required of me by the Constitution to give my reasons for disapproving . The power of Congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the Union has been a question of dispute from the origin of the Government . Men most justly and deservedly esteemed for their high intellectual endowments , their virtue , and their patriotism have in regard to it entertained different and conflicting opinions Congresses have differed the approval of one President has been followed by the disapproval of another the people at different times have acquiesced in decisions both for and against . The country has been and still is deeply agitated by this unsettled question . It will suffice for me to say that my own opinion has been uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise of any such power by this Government . On all suitable occasions during a period of twenty five years the opinion thus entertained has been unreservedly expressed . I declared it in the legislature of my native State in the House of Representatives of the United States it has been openly vindicated by me in the Senate Chamber , in the presence and hearing of many who are at this time members of that body , it has been affirmed and reaffirmed in speeches and reports there made and by votes there recorded in popular assemblies I have unhesitatingly announced it , and the last public declaration which I made and that but a short time before the late Presidential election I referred to my previously expressed opinions as being those then entertained by me . With a full knowledge of the opinions thus entertained and never concealed , I was elected by the people Vice President of the United States . By the occurrence of a contingency provided for in the Constitution and arising under an impressive dispensation of Providence I succeeded to the Presidential office . Before entering upon the duties of that office I took an oath that I would preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . Entertaining the opinions alluded to and having taken this oath , the Senate and the country will see that I could not give my sanction to a measure of the character described without surrendering all claim to the respect of honorable men , all confidence on the part of the people , all self respect , all regard for moral and religious obligations , without an observance of which no government can be prosperous and no people can be happy . It would be to commit a crime which I would not willfully commit to gain any earthly reward , and which would justly subject me to the ridicule and scorn of all virtuous men . I deem it entirely unnecessary at this time to enter upon the reasons which have brought my mind to the convictions I feel and entertain on this subject . They have been over and over again repeated . If some of those who have preceded me in this high office have entertained and avowed different opinions , I yield all confidence that their convictions were sincere . I claim only to have the same measure meted out to myself . Without going further into the argument , I will say that in looking to the powers of this Government to collect , safely keep , and disburse the public revenue , and incidentally to regulate the commerce and exchanges , I have not been able to satisfy myself that the establishment by this Government of a bank of discount in the ordinary acceptation of that term was a necessary means or one demanded by propriety to execute those powers . What can the local discounts of the bank have to do with the collecting , safe keeping , and disbursing of the revenue So far as the mere discounting of paper is concerned , it is quite immaterial to this question whether the discount is obtained at a State bank or a United States bank . They are both equally local , both beginning and both ending in a local accommodation . What influence have local discounts granted by any form of bank in the regulating of the currency and the exchanges Let the history of the late United States Bank aid us in answering this inquiry . For several years after the establishment of that institution it dealt almost exclusively in local discounts , and during that period the country was for the most part disappointed in the consequences anticipated from its incorporation . A uniform currency was not provided , exchanges were not regulated , and little or nothing was added to the general circulation , and in 1920 its embarrassments had become so great that the directors petitioned Congress to repeal that article of the charter which made its notes receivable everywhere in payment of the public dues . It had up to that period dealt to but a very small extent in exchanges , either foreign or domestic , and as late as 1823 its operations in that line amounted to a little more than 7 , 000 , 000 per annum . A very rapid augmentation soon after occurred , and in 1833 its dealings in the exchanges amounted to upward of 100 , 000 , 000 , including the sales of its own drafts and all these immense transactions were effected without the employment of extraordinary means . The currency of the country became sound , and the negotiations in the exchanges were carried on at the lowest possible rates . The circulation was increased to more than 22 , 000 , 000 and the notes of the bank were regarded as equal to specie all over the country , thus showing almost conclusively that it was the capacity to deal in exchanges , and not in local discounts , which furnished these facilities and advantages . It may be remarked , too , that notwithstanding the immense transactions of the bank in the purchase of exchange , the losses sustained were merely nominal , while in the line of discounts the suspended debt was enormous and proved most disastrous to the bank and the country . Its power of local discount has in fact proved to be a fruitful source of favoritism and corruption , alike destructive to the public morals and to the general weal . The capital invested in banks of discount in the United States , created by the States , at this time exceeds 350 , 000 , 000 , and if the discounting of local paper could have produced any beneficial effects the United States ought to possess the soundest currency in the world but the reverse is lamentably the fact . Is the measure now under consideration of the objectionable character to which I have alluded It is clearly so unless by the sixteenth fundamental article of the eleventh section it is made otherwise . That article is in the following words The directors of the said corporation shall establish one competent office of discount and deposit in any State in which two thousand shares shall have been subscribed or may be held , whenever , upon application of the legislature of such State , Congress may by law require the same . And the said directors may also establish one or more competent offices of discount and deposit in any Territory or District of the United States , and in any State with the assent of such State , and when established the said office or offices shall be only withdrawn or removed by the said directors prior to the expiration of this charter with the previous assent of Congress Provided , In respect to any State which shall not , at the first session of the legislature thereof held after the passage of this act , by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding , unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or offices within it , such assent of the said State shall be thereafter presumed And provided , nevertheless , That whenever it shall become necessary and proper for carrying into execution any of the powers granted by the Constitution to establish an office or offices in any of the States whatever , and the establishment thereof shall be directed by law , it shall be the duty of the said directors to establish such office or offices accordingly . It will be seen that by this clause the directors are invested with the fullest power to establish a branch in any State which has yielded its assent and having once established such branch , it shall not afterwards be withdrawn except by order of Congress . Such assent is to be implied and to have the force and sanction of an actually expressed assent , provided , in respect to any State which shall not , at the first session of the legislature thereof held after the passage of this act , by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding , unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or offices within it , such assent of said State shall be thereafter presumed . The assent or dissent is to be expressed unconditionally at the first session of the legislature , by some formal legislative act and if not so expressed its assent is to be implied , and the directors are thereupon invested with power , at such time thereafter as they may please , to establish branches , which can not afterwards be withdrawn except by resolve of Congress . No matter what may be the cause which may operate with the legislature , which either prevents it from speaking or addresses itself to its wisdom , to induce delay , its assent is to be implied . This iron rule is to give way to no circumstances it is unbending and inflexible . It is the language of the master to the vassal an unconditional answer is claimed forthwith , and delay , postponement , or incapacity to answer produces an implied assent which is ever after irrevocable . Many of the State elections have already taken place without any knowledge on the part of the people that such a question was to come up . The representatives may desire a submission of the question to their constituents preparatory to final action upon it , but this high privilege is denied whatever may be the motives and views entertained by the representatives of the people to induce delay , their assent is to be presumed , and is ever afterwards binding unless their dissent shall be unconditionally expressed at their first session after the passage of this bill into a law . They may by formal resolution declare the question of assent or dissent to be undecided and postponed , and yet , in opposition to their express declaration to the contrary , their assent is to be implied . Cases innumerable might be cited to manifest the irrationality of such an inference . Let one or two in addition suffice . The popular branch of the legislature may express its dissent by an unanimous vote , and its resolution may be defeated by a tie vote of the senate , and yet the assent is to be implied . Both branches of the legislature may concur in a resolution of decided dissent , and yet the governor may exert the veto power conferred on him by the State constitution , and their legislative action be defeated , and yet the assent of the legislative authority is implied , and the directors of this contemplated institution are authorized to establish a branch or branches in such State whenever they may find it conducive to the interest of the stockholders to do so and having once established it they can under no circumstances withdraw it except by act of Congress . The State may afterwards protest against such unjust inference , but its authority is gone . Its assent is implied by its failure or inability to act at its first session , and its voice can never afterwards be heard . To inferences so violent and , as they seem to me , irrational I can not yield my consent . No court of justice would or could sanction them without reversing all that is established in judicial proceeding by introducing presumptions at variance with fact and inferences at the expense of reason . A State in a condition of duress would be presumed to speak as an individual manacled and in prison might be presumed to be in the enjoyment of freedom . Far better to say to the States boldly and frankly , Congress wills and submission is demanded . It may be said that the directors may not establish branches under such circumstances but this is a question of power , and this bill invests them with full authority to do so . If the legislature of New York or Pennsylvania or any other State should be found to be in such condition as I have supposed , could there be any security furnished against such a step on the part of the directors Nay , is it not fairly to be presumed that this proviso was introduced for the sole purpose of meeting the contingency referred to Why else should it have been introduced And I submit to the Senate whether it can be believed that any State would be likely to sit quietly down under such a state of things . In a great measure of public interest their patriotism may be successfully appealed to , but to infer their assent from circumstances at war with such inference I can not but regard as calculated to excite a feeling at fatal enmity with the peace and harmony of the country . I must therefore regard this clause as asserting the power to be in Congress to establish offices of discount in a State not only without its assent , but against its dissent , and so regarding it I can not sanction it . On general principles the right in Congress to prescribe terms to any State implies a superiority of power and control , deprives the transaction of all pretense to compact between them , and terminates , as we have seen , in the total abrogation of freedom of action on the part of the States . But , further , the State may express , after the most solemn form of legislation , its dissent , which may from time to time thereafter be repeated in full view of its own interest , which can never be separated from the wise and beneficent operation of this Government , and yet Congress may by virtue of the last proviso overrule its law , and upon grounds which to such State will appear to rest on a constructive necessity and propriety and nothing more . I regard the bill as asserting for Congress the right to incorporate a United States bank with power and right to establish offices of discount and deposit in the several States of this Union with or without their consent a principle to which I have always heretofore been opposed and which can never obtain my sanction and waiving all other considerations growing out of its other provisions , I return it to the House in which it originated with these my objections to its approval .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States We have continued cause for expressing our gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for the benefits and blessings which our country , under His kind providence , has enjoyed during the past year . Notwithstanding the exciting scenes through which we have passed , nothing has occurred to disturb the general peace or to derange the harmony of our political system . The great moral spectacle has been exhibited of a nation approximating in number to 20 , 000 , 000 people having performed the high and important function of electing their Chief Magistrate for the term of four years without the commission of any acts of violence or the manifestation of a spirit of insubordination to the laws . The great and inestimable right of suffrage has been exercised by all who were invested with it under the laws of the different States in a spirit dictated alone by a desire , in the selection of the agent , to advance the interests of the country and to place beyond jeopardy the institutions under which it is our happiness to live . That the deepest interest has been manifested by all our countrymen in the result of the election is not less true than highly creditable to them . Vast multitudes have assembled from time to time at various places for the purpose of canvassing the merits and pretensions of those who were presented for their suffrages , but no armed soldiery has been necessary to restrain within proper limits the popular zeal or to prevent violent outbreaks . A principle much more controlling was found in the love of order and obedience to the laws , which , with mere individual exceptions , everywhere possesses the American mind , and controls with an influence far more powerful than hosts of armed men . We can not dwell upon this picture without recognizing in it that deep and devoted attachment on the part of the people to the institutions under which we live which proclaims their perpetuity . The great objection which has always prevailed against the election by the people of their chief executive officer has been the apprehension of tumults and disorders which might involve in ruin the entire Government . A security against this is found not only in the fact before alluded to , but in the additional fact that we live under a Confederacy embracing already twenty six States , no one of which has power to control the election . The popular vote in each State is taken at the time appointed by the laws , and such vote is announced by the electoral college without reference to the decision of other States . The right of suffrage and the mode of conducting the election are regulated by the laws of each State , and the election is distinctly federative in all its prominent features . Thus it is that , unlike what might be the results under a consolidated system , riotous proceedings , should they prevail , could only affect the elections in single States without disturbing to any dangerous extent the tranquillity of others . The great experiment of a political confederation each member of which is supreme as to all matters appertaining to its local interests and its internal peace and happiness , while by a voluntary compact with others it confides to the united power of all the protection of its citizens in matters not domestic has been so far crowned with complete success . The world has witnessed its rapid growth in wealth and population , and under the guide and direction of a superintending Providence the developments of the past may be regarded but as the shadowing forth of the mighty future . In the bright prospects of that future we shall find , as patriots and philanthropists , the highest inducements to cultivate and cherish a love of union and to frown down every measure or effort which may be made to alienate the States or the people of the States in sentiment and feeling from each other . A rigid and close adherence to the terms of our political compact and , above all , a sacred observance of the guaranties of the Constitution will preserve union on a foundation which can not be shaken , while personal liberty is placed beyond hazard or jeopardy . The guaranty of religious freedom , of the freedom of the press , of the liberty of speech , of the trial by jury , of the habeas corpus , and of the domestic institutions of each of the States , leaving the private citizen in the full exercise of the high and ennobling attributes of his nature and to each State the privilege which can only be judiciously exerted by itself of consulting the means best calculated to advance its own happiness these are the great and important guaranties of the Constitution which the lovers of liberty must cherish and the advocates of union must ever cultivate . Preserving these and avoiding all interpolations by forced construction under the guise of an imagined expediency upon the Constitution , the influence of our political system is destined to be as actively and as beneficially felt on the distant shores of the Pacific as it is now on those of the Atlantic Ocean . The only formidable impediments in the way of its successful expansion time and space are so far in the progress of modification by the improvements of the age as to render no longer speculative the ability of representatives from that remote region to come up to the Capitol , so that their constituents shall participate in all the benefits of Federal legislation . Thus it is that in the progress of time the inestimable principles of civil liberty will be enjoyed by millions yet unborn and the great benefits of our system of government be extended to now distant and uninhabited regions . In view of the vast wilderness yet to be reclaimed , we may well invite the lover of freedom of every land to take up his abode among us and assist us in the great work of advancing the standard of civilization and giving a wider spread to the arts and refinements of cultivated life . Our prayers should evermore be offered up to the Father of the Universe for His wisdom to direct us in the path of our duty so as to enable us to consummate these high purposes . One of the strongest objections which has been urged against confederacies by writers on government is the liability of the members to be tampered with by foreign governments or the people of foreign states , either in their local affairs or in such as affected the peace of others or endangered the safety of the whole confederacy . We can not hope to be entirely exempt from such attempts on our peace and safety . The United States are becoming too important in population and resources not to attract the observation of other nations . It therefore may in the progress of time occur that opinions entirely abstract in the States which they may prevail and in no degree affecting their domestic institutions may be artfully but secretly encouraged with a view to undermine the Union . Such opinions may become the foundation of political parties , until at last the conflict of opinion , producing an alienation of friendly feeling among the people of the different States , may involve in general destruction the happy institutions under which we live . It should ever be borne in mind that what is true in regard to individuals is equally so in regard to states . An interference of one in the affairs of another is the fruitful cause of family dissensions and neighborhood disputes , and the same cause affects the peace , happiness , and prosperity of states . It may be most devoutly hoped that the good sense of the American people will ever be ready to repel all such attempts should they ever be made . There has been no material change in our foreign relations since my last annual message to Congress . With all the powers of Europe we continue on the most friendly terms . Indeed , it affords me much satisfaction to state that at no former period has the peace of that enlightened and important quarter of the globe ever been , apparently , more firmly established . The conviction that peace is the true policy of nations would seem to be growing and becoming deeper amongst the enlightened everywhere , and there is no people who have a stronger interest in cherishing the sentiments and adopting the means of preserving and giving it permanence than those of the United States . Amongst these , the first and most effective are , no doubt , the strict observance of justice and the honest and punctual fulfillment of all engagements . But it is not to be forgotten that in the present state of the world it is no less necessary to be ready to enforce their observance and fulfillment in reference to ourselves than to observe and fulfill them on our part in regard to others . Since the close of your last session a negotiation has been formally entered upon between the Secretary of State and Her Britannic Majesty s minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary residing at Washington relative to the rights of their respective nations in and over the Oregon Territory . That negotiation is still pending . Should it during your session be brought to a definitive conclusion , the result will be promptly communicated to Congress . I would , however , again call your attention to the recommendations contained in previous messages designed to protect and facilitate emigration to that Territory . The establishment of military posts at suitable points upon the extended line of land travel would enable our citizens to emigrate in comparative safety to the fertile regions below the Falls of the Columbia , and make the provision of the existing convention for the joint occupation of the territory by subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States more available than heretofore to the latter . These posts would constitute places of rest for the weary emigrant , where he would be sheltered securely against the danger of attack from the Indians and be enabled to recover from the exhaustion of a long line of travel . Legislative enactments should also be made which should spread over him the aegis of our laws , so as to afford protection to his person and property when he shall have reached his distant home . In this latter respect the British Government has been much more careful of the interests of such of her people as are to be found in that country than the United States . She has made necessary provision for their security and protection against the acts of the viciously disposed and lawless , and her emigrant reposes in safety under the panoply of her laws . Whatever may be the result of the pending negotiation , such measures are necessary . It will afford me the greatest pleasure to witness a happy and favorable termination to the existing negotiation upon terms compatible with the public honor , and the best efforts of the Government will continue to be directed to this end . It would have given me the highest gratification in this my last annual communication to Congress to have been able to announce to you the complete and entire settlement and adjustment of other matters in difference between the United States and the Government of Her Britannic Majesty , which were adverted to in a previous message . It is so obviously the interest of both countries , in respect to the large and valuable commerce which exists between them , that all causes of complaint , however inconsiderable , should be with the greatest promptitude removed that it must be regarded as cause of regret that any unnecessary delays should be permitted to intervene . It is true that in a pecuniary point of view the matters alluded to are altogether insignificant in amount when compared with the ample resources of that great nation , but they nevertheless , more particularly that limited class which arise under seizures and detentions of American ships on the coast of Africa upon the mistaken supposition indulged in at the time the wrong was committed of their being engaged in the slave trade , deeply affect the sensibilities of this Government and people . Great Britain , having recognized her responsibility to repair all such wrongs by her action in other cases , leaves nothing to be regretted upon the subject and to all cases arising prior to the treaty of Washington than the delay in making suitable reparation in such of them as fall plainly within the principle of others which she has long since adjusted . The injury inflicted by delays in the settlement of these claims falls with severity upon the individual claimants and makes a strong appeal to her magnanimity and sense of justice for a speedy settlement . Other matters arising out of the construction of existing treaties also remain unadjusted , and will continue to be urged upon her attention . The labors of the joint commission appointed by the two Governments to run the dividing line established by the treaty of Washington were , unfortunately , much delayed in the commencement of the season by the failure of Congress at its last session to make a timely appropriation of funds to meet the expenses of the American party , and by other causes . The United States commissioner , however , expresses his expectation that by increased diligence and energy the party will be able to make up for lost time . We continue to receive assurances of the most friendly feelings on the part of all the other European powers , with each and all of whom it is so obviously our interest to cultivate the most amicable relations nor can I anticipate the occurrence of any event which would be likely in any degree to disturb those relations . Russia , the great northern power , under the judicious sway of her Emperor , is constantly advancing in the road of science and improvement , while France , guided by the counsels of her wise Sovereign , pursues a course calculated to consolidate the general peace . Spain has obtained a breathing spell of some duration from the internal convulsions which have through so many years marred her prosperity , while Austria , the Netherlands , Prussia , Belgium , and the other powers of Europe reap a rich harvest of blessings from the prevailing peace . I informed the two Houses of Congress in my message of December last that instructions had been given to Wheaton , our minister at Berlin , to negotiate a treaty with the Germanic States composing the Zollverein if it could be done , stipulating , as far as it was practicable to accomplish it , for a reduction of the heavy and onerous duties levied on our tobacco and other leading articles of agricultural production , and yielding in return on our part a reduction of duties on such articles the product of their industry as should not come into competition , or but a limited one , with articles the product of our manufacturing industry . The Executive in giving such instructions considered itself as acting in strict conformity with the wishes of Congress as made known through several measures which it had adopted , all directed to the accomplishment of this important result . The treaty was therefore negotiated , by which essential reductions were secured in the duties levied by the Zollverein on tobacco , rice , and lard , accompanied by a stipulation for the admission of raw cotton free of duty in exchange for which highly important concessions a reduction of duties imposed by the laws of the United States on a variety of articles , most of which were admitted free of all duty under the act of Congress commonly known as the compromise law , and but few of which were produced in the United States , was stipulated for on our part . This treaty was communicated to the Senate at an early day of its last session , but not acted upon until near its close , when , for the want as I am bound to presume of full time to consider it , it was laid upon the table . This procedure had the effect of virtually rejecting it , in consequence of a stipulation contained in the treaty that its ratifications should be exchanged on or before a day which has already passed . The Executive , acting upon the fair inference that the Senate did not intend its absolute rejection , gave instructions to our minister at Berlin to reopen the negotiation so far as to obtain an extension of time for the exchange of ratifications . I regret , however , to say that his , efforts in this respect have been unsuccessful . I am nevertheless not without hope that the great advantages which were intended to be secured by the treaty may yet be realized . I am happy to inform you that Belgium has , by an arrete royale issued in July last , assimilated the flag of the United States to her own , so far as the direct trade between the two countries is concerned . This measure will prove of great service to our shipping interest , the trade having heretofore been carried on chiefly in foreign bottoms . I flatter myself that she will speedily resort to a modification of her system relating to the tobacco trade , which would decidedly benefit the agriculture of the United States and operate to the mutual advantage of both countries . No definitive intelligence has yet been received from our minister of the conclusion of a treaty with the Chinese Empire , but enough is known to induce the strongest hopes that the mission will be crowned with success . With Brazil our relations continue on the most friendly footing . The commercial intercourse between that growing Empire and the United States is becoming daily of greater importance to both , and it is to the interest of both that the firmest relations of amity and good will should continue to be cultivated between them . The Republic of New Granada still withholds , notwithstanding the most persevering efforts have been employed by our charge d affaires , Blackford , to produce a different result , indemnity in the case of the brig Morris and the Congress of Venezuela , although an arrangement has been effected between our minister and the minister of foreign affairs of that Government for the payment of 18 , 000 in discharge of its liabilities in the same case , has altogether neglected to make provision for its payment . It is to be hoped that a sense of justice will soon induce a settlement of these claims . Our late minister to Chili , Pendleton , has returned to the United States without having effected an adjustment in the second claim of the Macedonian , which is delayed on grounds altogether frivolous and untenable . Pendleton s successor has been directed to urge the claim in the strongest terms , and , in the event of a failure to obtain a prompt adjustment , to report the fact to the Executive at as early a day as possible , so that the whole matter may be communicated to Congress . At your last session I submitted to the attention of Congress the convention with the Republic of Peru of the 17th March , 1841 , providing for the adjustment of the claims of citizens of the United States against that Republic , but no definitive action was taken upon the subject . I again invite to it your attention and prompt action . In my last annual message I felt it to be my duty to make known to Congress , in terms both plain and emphatic , my opinion in regard to the war which has so long existed between Mexico and Texas which since the battle of San Jacinto has consisted altogether of predatory incursions , attended by circumstances revolting to humanity . I repeat now what I then said , that after eight years of feeble and ineffectual efforts to reconquer Texas it was time that the war should have ceased . The United States have a direct interest in the question . The contiguity of the two nations to our territory was but too well calculated to involve our peace . Unjust suspicions were engendered in the mind of one or the other of the belligerents against us , and as a necessary consequence American interests were made to suffer and our peace became daily endangered in addition to which it must have been obvious to all that the exhaustion produced by the war subjected both Mexico and Texas to the interference of other powers , which , without the interposition of this Government , might eventuate in the most serious injury to the United States . This Government from time to time exerted its friendly offices to bring about a termination of hostilities upon terms honorable alike to both the belligerents . Its efforts in this behalf proved unavailing . Mexico seemed almost without an object to persevere in the war , and no other alternative was left the Executive but to take advantage of the well known dispositions of Texas and to invite her to enter into a treaty for annexing her territory to that of the United States . Since your last session Mexico has threatened to renew the war , and has either made or proposes to make formidable preparations for invading Texas . She has issued decrees and proclamations , preparatory to the commencement of hostilities , full of threats revolting to humanity , and which if carried into effect would arouse the attention of all Christendom . This new demonstration of feeling , there is too much reason to believe , has been produced in consequence of the negotiation of the late treaty of annexation with Texas . The Executive , therefore , could not be indifferent to such proceedings , and it felt it to be due as well to itself as to the honor of the country that a strong representation should be made to the Mexican Government upon the subject . This was accordingly done , as will be seen by the copy of the accompanying dispatch from the Secretary of State to the United States envoy at Mexico . Mexico has no right to jeopard the peace of the world by urging any longer a useless and fruitless contest . Such a condition of things would not be tolerated on the European continent . Why should it be on this A war of desolation , such as is now threatened by Mexico , can not be waged without involving our peace and tranquillity . It is idle to believe that such a war could be looked upon with indifference by our own citizens inhabiting adjoining States and our neutrality would be violated in despite of all efforts on the part of the Government to prevent it . The country is settled by emigrants from the United States under invitations held out to them by Spain and Mexico . Those emigrants have left behind them friends and relatives , who would not fail to sympathize with them in their difficulties , and who would be led by those sympathies to participate in their struggles , however energetic the action of the Government to prevent it . Nor would the numerous and formidable bands of Indians the most warlike to be found in any land which occupy the extensive regions contiguous to the States of Arkansas and Missouri , and who are in possession of large tracts of country within the limits of Texas , be likely to remain passive . The inclinations of those numerous tribes lead them invariably to war whenever pretexts exist . Mexico had no just ground of displeasure against this Government or people for negotiating the treaty . What interest of hers was affected by the treaty She was despoiled of nothing , since Texas was forever lost to her . The independence of Texas was recognized by several of the leading powers of the earth . She was free to treat , free to adopt her own line of policy , free to take the course which she believed was best calculated to secure her happiness . Her Government and people decided on annexation to the United States , and the Executive saw in the acquisition of such a territory the means of advancing their permanent happiness and glory . What principle of good faith , then , was violated What rule of political morals trampled under foot So far as Mexico herself was concerned , the measure should have been regarded by her as highly beneficial . Her inability to reconquer Texas had been exhibited , I repeat , by eight now nine years of fruitless and ruinous contest . In the meantime Texas has been growing in population and resources . Emigration has flowed into her territory from all parts of the world in a current which continues to increase in strength . Mexico requires a permanent boundary between that young Republic and herself . Texas at no distant day , if she continues separate and detached from the United States , will inevitably seek to consolidate her strength by adding to her domain the contiguous Provinces of Mexico . The spirit of revolt from the control of the central Government has heretofore manifested itself in some of those Provinces , and it is fair to infer that they would be inclined to take the first favorable opportunity to proclaim their independence and to form close alliances with Texas . The war would thus be endless , or if cessations of hostilities should occur they would only endure for a season . The interests of Mexico , therefore , could in nothing be better consulted than in a peace with her neighbors which would result in the establishment of a permanent boundary . Upon the ratification of the treaty the Executive was prepared to treat with her on the most liberal basis . Hence the boundaries of Texas were left undefined by the treaty . The Executive proposed to settle these upon terms that all the world should have pronounced just and reasonable . No negotiation upon that point could have been undertaken between the United States and Mexico in advance of the ratification of the treaty . We should have had no right , no power , no authority , to have conducted such a negotiation , and to have undertaken it would have been an assumption equally revolting to the pride of Mexico and Texas and subjecting us to the charge of arrogance , while to have proposed in advance of annexation to satisfy Mexico for any contingent interest she might have in Texas would have been to have treated Texas not as an independent power , but as a mere dependency of Mexico . This assumption could not have been acted on by the Executive without setting at defiance your own solemn declaration that that Republic was an independent State . Mexico had , it is true , threatened war against the United States in the event the treaty of annexation was ratified . The Executive could not permit itself to be influenced by this threat . It represented in this the spirit of our people , who are ready to sacrifice much for peace , but nothing to intimidation . A war under any circumstances is greatly to be deplored , and the United States is the last nation to desire it but if , as the condition of peace , it be required of us to forego the unquestionable right of treating with an independent power of our own continent upon matters highly interesting to both , and that upon a naked and unsustained pretension of claim by a third power to control the free will of the power with whom we treat , devoted as we may be to peace and anxious to cultivate friendly relations with the whole world , the Executive does not hesitate to say that the people of the United States would be ready to brave all consequences sooner than submit to such condition . But no apprehension of war was entertained by the Executive , and I must express frankly the opinion that had the treaty been ratified by the Senate it would have been followed by a prompt settlement , to the entire satisfaction of Mexico , of every matter in difference between the two countries . Seeing , then , that new preparations for hostile invasion of Texas were about to be adopted by Mexico , and that these were brought about because Texas had adopted the suggestions of the Executive upon the subject of annexation , it could not passively have folded its arms and permitted a war , threatened to be accompanied by every act that could mark a barbarous age , to be waged against her because she had done so . Other considerations of a controlling character influenced the course of the Executive . The treaty which had thus been negotiated had failed to receive the ratification of the Senate . One of the chief objections which was urged against it was found to consist in the fact that the question of annexation had not been submitted to the ordeal of public opinion in the United States . However untenable such an objection was esteemed to be , in view of the unquestionable power of the Executive to negotiate the treaty and the great and lasting interests involved in the question , I felt it to be my duty to submit the whole subject to Congress as the best expounders of popular sentiment . No definitive action having been taken on the subject by Congress , the question referred itself directly to the decision of the States and people . The great popular election which has just terminated afforded the best opportunity of ascertaining the will of the States and the people upon it . Pending that issue it became the imperative duty of the Executive to inform Mexico that the question of annexation was still before the American people , and that until their decision was pronounced any serious invasion of Texas would be regarded as an attempt to forestall their judgment and could not be looked upon with indifference . I am most happy to inform you that no such invasion has taken place and I trust that whatever your action may be upon it Mexico will see the importance of deciding the matter by a resort to peaceful expedients in preference to those of arms . The decision of the people and the States on this great and interesting subject has been decisively manifested . The question of annexation has been presented nakedly to their consideration . By the treaty itself all collateral and incidental issues which were calculated to divide and distract the public councils were carefully avoided . These were left to the wisdom of the future to determine . It presented , I repeat , the isolated question of annexation , and in that form it has been submitted to the ordeal of public sentiment . A controlling majority of the people and a large majority of the States have declared in favor of immediate annexation . Instructions have thus come up to both branches of Congress from their respective constituents in terms the most emphatic . It is the will of both the people and the States that Texas shall be annexed to the Union promptly and immediately . It may be hoped that in carrying into execution the public will thus declared all collateral issues may be avoided . Future Legislatures can best decide as to the number of States which should be formed out of the territory when the time has arrived for deciding that question . So with all others . By the treaty the United States assumed the payment of the debts of Texas to an amount not exceeding 10 , 000 , 000 , to be paid , with the exception of a sum falling short of 400 , 000 , exclusively out of the proceeds of the sales of her public lands . We could not with honor take the lands without assuming the full payment of all incumbencies upon them . Nothing has occurred since your last session to induce a doubt that the dispositions of Texas remain unaltered . No intimation of an altered determination on the part of her Government and people has been furnished to the Executive . She still desires to throw herself under the protection of our laws and to partake of the blessings of our federative system , while every American interest would seem to require it . The extension of our coastwise and foreign trade to an amount almost incalculable , the enlargement of the market for our manufactures , a constantly growing market for our agricultural productions , safety to our frontiers , and additional strength and stability to the Union these are the results which would rapidly develop themselves upon the consummation of the measure of annexation . In such event I will not doubt but that Mexico would find her true interest to consist in meeting the advances of this Government in a spirit of amity . Nor do I apprehend any serious complaint from any other quarter no sufficient ground exists for such complaint . We should interfere in no respect with the rights of any other nation . There can not be gathered from the act any design on our part to do so with their possessions on this continent . We have interposed no impediments in the way of such acquisitions of territory , large and extensive as many of them are , as the leading powers of Europe have made from time to time in every part of the world . We seek no conquest made by war . No intrigue will have been resorted to or acts of diplomacy essayed to accomplish the annexation of Texas . Free and independent herself , she asks to be received into our Union . It is a question for our own decision whether she shall be received or not . The two Governments having already agreed through their respective organs on the terms of annexation , I would recommend their adoption by Congress in the form of a joint resolution or act to be perfected and made binding on the two countries when adopted in like manner by the Government of Texas . In order that the subject may be fully presented in all its bearings , the correspondence which has taken place in reference to it since the adjournment of Congress between the United States , Texas , and Mexico is herewith transmitted . The amendments proposed by the Senate to the convention concluded between the United States and Mexico on the 20th of November , 1843 , have been transmitted through our minister for the concurrence of the Mexican Government , but , although urged thereto , no action has yet been had on the subject , nor has any answer been given which would authorize a favorable conclusion in the future . The decree of September , 1843 , in relation to the retail trade , the order for the expulsion of foreigners , and that of a more recent date in regard to passports all which are considered as in violation of the treaty of amity and commerce between the two countries have led to a correspondence of considerable length between the minister for foreign relations and our representatives at Mexico , but without any satisfactory result . They remain still unadjusted , and many and serious inconveniences have already resulted to our citizens in consequence of them . Questions growing out of the act of disarming a body of Texan troops under the command of Major Snively by an officer in the service of the United States , acting under the orders of our Government , and the forcible entry into the custom house at Bryarlys Landing , on Red River , by certain citizens of the United States , and taking away therefrom the goods seized by the collector of the customs as forfeited under the laws of Texas , have been adjusted so far as the powers of the Executive extend . The correspondence between the two Governments in reference to both subjects will be found amongst the accompanying documents . It contains a full statement of all the facts and circumstances , with the views taken on both sides and the principles on which the questions have been adjusted . It remains for Congress to make the necessary appropriation to carry the arrangement into effect , which I respectfully recommend . The greatly improved condition of the Treasury affords a subject for general congratulation . The paralysis which had fallen on trade and commerce , and which subjected the Government to the necessity of resorting to loans and the issue of Treasury notes to a large amount , has passed away , and after the payment of upward of 7 , 000 , 000 on account of the interest , and in redemption of more than 5 , 000 , 000 of the public debt which falls due on the 1st of January next , and setting apart upward of 2 , 000 , 000 for the payment of outstanding Treasury notes and meeting an installment of the debts of the corporate cities of the District of Columbia , an estimated surplus of upward of 7 , 000 , 000 over and above the existing appropriations will remain in the Treasury at the close of the fiscal year . Should the Treasury notes continue outstanding as heretofore , that surplus will be considerably augmented . Although all interest has ceased upon them and the Government has invited their return to the Treasury , yet they remain outstanding , affording great facilities to commerce , and establishing the fact that under a well regulated system of finance the Government has resources within itself which render it independent in time of need , not only of private loans , but also of bank facilities . The only remaining subject of regret is that the remaining stocks of the Government do not fall due at an earlier day , since their redemption would be entirely within its control . As it is , it may be well worthy the consideration of Congress whether the law establishing the sinking fund under the operation of which the debts of the Revolution and last war with Great Britain were to a great extent extinguished should not , with proper modifications , so as to prevent an accumulation of surpluses , and limited in amount to a specific sum , be reenacted . Such provision , which would authorize the Government to go into the market for a purchase of its own stock on fair terms , would serve to maintain its credit at the highest point and prevent to a great extent those fluctuations in the price of its securities which might under other circumstances affect its credit . No apprehension of this sort is at this moment entertained , since the stocks of the Government , which but two years ago were offered for sale to capitalists at home and abroad at a depreciation , and could find no purchasers , are now greatly above par in the hands of the holders but a wise and prudent forecast admonishes us to place beyond the reach of contingency the public credit . It must also be a matter of unmingled gratification that under the existing financial system resting upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816 the currency of the country has attained a state of perfect soundness and the rates of exchange between different parts of the Union , which in 1841 denoted by their enormous amount the great depreciation and , in fact , worthlessness of the currency in most of the States , are now reduced to little more than the mere expense of transporting specie from place to place and the risk incident to the operation . In a new country like that of the United States , where so many inducements are held out for speculation , the depositories of the surplus revenue , consisting of banks of any description , when it reaches any considerable amount , require the closest vigilance on the part of the Government . All banking institutions , under whatever denomination they may pass , are governed by an almost exclusive regard to the interest of the stockholders . That interest consists in the augmentation of profits in the form of dividends , and a large surplus revenue intrusted to their custody is but too apt to lead to excessive loans and to extravagantly large issues of paper . As a necessary consequence prices are nominally increased and the speculative mania very soon seizes upon the public mind . A fictitious state of prosperity for a season exists , and , in the language of the day , money becomes plenty . Contracts are entered into by individuals resting on this unsubstantial state of things , but the delusion speedily passes away and the country is overrun with an indebtedness so weighty as to overwhelm many and to visit every department of industry with great and ruinous embarrassment . The greatest vigilance becomes necessary on the part of Government to guard against this state of things . The depositories must be given distinctly to understand that the favors of the Government will be altogether withdrawn , or substantially diminished , if its revenues shall be regarded as additions to their banking capital or as the foundation of an enlarged circulation . The Government , through its revenue , has at all times an important part to perform in connection with the currency , and it greatly depends upon its vigilance and care whether the country be involved in embarrassments similar to those which it has had recently to encounter , or , aided by the action of the Treasury , shall be preserved in a sound and healthy condition . The dangers to be guarded against are greatly augmented by too large a surplus of revenue . When that surplus greatly exceeds in amount what shall be required by a wise and prudent forecast to meet unforeseen contingencies , the Legislature itself may come to be seized with a disposition to indulge in extravagant appropriations to objects many of which may , and most probably would , be found to conflict with the Constitution . A fancied expediency is elevated above constitutional authority , and a reckless and wasteful extravagance but too certainly follows . The important power of taxation , which when exercised in its most restricted form is a burthen on labor and production , is resorted to under various pretexts for purposes having no affinity to the motives which dictated its grant , and the extravagance of Government stimulates individual extravagance until the spirit of a wild and ill regulated speculation involves one and all in its unfortunate results . In view of such fatal consequences , it may be laid down as an axiom rounded in moral and political truth that no greater taxes should be imposed than are necessary for an economical administration of the Government , and that whatever exists beyond should be reduced or modified . This doctrine does in no way conflict with the exercise of a sound discrimination in the selection of the articles to be taxed , which a due regard to the public weal would at all times suggest to the legislative mind . It leaves the range of selection undefined and such selection should always be made with an eye to the great interests of the country . Composed as is the Union of separate and independent States , a patriotic Legislature will not fail in consulting the interests of the parts to adopt such course as will be best calculated to advance the harmony of the whole , and thus insure that permanency in the policy of the Government without which all efforts to advance the public prosperity are vain and fruitless . This great and vitally important task rests with Congress , and the Executive can do no more than recommend the general principles which should govern in its execution . I refer you to the report of the Secretary of War for an exhibition of the condition of the Army , and recommend to you as well worthy your best consideration many of the suggestions it contains . The Secretary in no degree exaggerates the great importance of pressing forward without delay in the work of erecting and finishing the fortifications to which he particularly alludes . Much has been done toward placing our cities and roadsteads in a state of security against the hazards of hostile attack within the last four years but considering the new elements which have been of late years employed in the propelling of ships and the formidable implements of destruction which have been brought into service , we can not be too active or vigilant in preparing and perfecting the means of defense . I refer you also to his report for a full statement of the condition of the Indian tribes within our jurisdiction . The Executive has abated no effort in carrying into effect the well established policy of the Government which contemplates a removal of all the tribes residing within the limits of the several States beyond those limits , and it is now enabled to congratulate the country at the prospect of an early consummation of this object . Many of the tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized life , and through the operation of the schools established among them , aided by the efforts of the pious men of various religious denominations who devote themselves to the task of their improvement , we may fondly hope that the remains of the formidable tribes which were once masters of this country will in their transition from the savage state to a condition of refinement and cultivation add another bright trophy to adorn the labors of a well directed philanthropy . The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy will explain to you the situation of that branch of the service . The present organization of the Department imparts to its operations great efficiency , but I concur fully in the propriety of a division of the Bureau of Construction , Equipment , Increase , and Repairs into two bureaus . The subjects as now arranged are incongruous , and require to a certain extent information and qualifications altogether dissimilar . The operations of the squadron on the coast of Africa have been conducted with all due attention to the object which led to its origination , and I am happy to say that the officers and crews have enjoyed the best possible health under the system adopted by the officer in command . It is believed that the United States is the only nation which has by its laws subjected to the punishment of death as pirates those who may be engaged in the slave trade . A similar enactment on the part of other nations would not fail to be attended by beneficial results . In consequence of the difficulties which have existed in the way of securing titles for the necessary grounds , operations have not yet been commenced toward the establishment of the navy yard at Memphis . So soon as the title is perfected no further delay will be permitted to intervene . It is well worthy of your consideration whether Congress should not direct the establishment of a ropewalk in connection with the contemplated navy yard , as a measure not only of economy , but as highly useful and necessary . The only establishment of the sort now connected with the service is located at Boston , and the advantages of a similar establishment convenient to the hemp growing region must be apparent to all . The report of the Secretary presents other matters to your consideration of an important character in connection with the service . In referring you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster General it affords me continued cause of gratification to be able to advert to the fact that the affairs of the Department for the last four years have been so conducted as from its unaided resources to meet its large expenditures . On my coming into office a debt of nearly 500 , 000 existed against the Department , which Congress discharged by an appropriation from the Treasury . The Department on the 4th of March next will be found , under the management of its present efficient head , free of debt or embarrassment , which could only have been done by the observance and practice of the greatest vigilance and economy . The laws have contemplated throughout that the Department should be self sustained , but it may become necessary , with the wisest regard to the public interests , to introduce amendments and alterations in the system . There is a strong desire manifested in many quarters so to alter the tariff of letter postage as to reduce the amount of tax at present imposed . Should such a measure be carried into effect to the full extent desired , it can not well be doubted but that for the first years of its operation a diminished revenue would be collected , the supply of which would necessarily constitute a charge upon the Treasury . Whether such a result would be desirable it will be for Congress in its wisdom to determine . It may in general be asserted as true that radical alterations in any system should rather be brought about gradually than by sudden changes and by pursuing this prudent policy in the reduction of letter postage the Department might still sustain itself through the revenue which would accrue by the increase of letters . The state and condition of the public Treasury has heretofore been such as to have precluded the recommendation of any material change . The difficulties upon this head have , however , ceased , and a larger discretion is now left to the Government . I can not too strongly urge the policy of authorizing the establishment of a line of steamships regularly to ply between this country and foreign ports and upon our own waters for the transportation of the mail . The example of the British Government is well worthy of imitation in this respect . The belief is strongly entertained that the emoluments arising from the transportation of mail matter to foreign countries would operate of itself as an inducement to cause individual enterprise to undertake that branch of the task , and the remuneration of the Government would consist in the addition readily made to our steam navy in case of emergency by the ships so employed . Should this suggestion meet your approval , the propriety of placing such ships under the command of experienced officers of the Navy will not escape your observation . The application of steam to the purposes of naval warfare cogently recommends an extensive steam marine as important in estimating the defenses of the country . Fortunately this may be obtained by us to a great extent without incurring any large amount of expenditure . Steam vessels to be engaged in the transportation of the mails on our principal water courses , lakes , and ports of our coast could also be so constructed as to be efficient as war vessels when needed , and would of themselves constitute a formidable force in order to repel attacks from abroad . . We can not be blind to the fact that other nations have already added large numbers of steamships to their naval armaments and that this new and powerful agent is destined to revolutionize the condition of the world . It becomes the United States , therefore , looking to their security , to adopt a similar policy , and the plan suggested will enable them to do so at a small comparative cost . I take the greatest pleasure in bearing testimony to the zeal and untiring industry which has characterized the conduct of the members of the Executive Cabinet . Each in his appropriate sphere has rendered me the most efficient aid in carrying on the Government , and it will not , I trust , appear out of place for me to bear this public testimony . The cardinal objects which should ever be held in view by those intrusted with the administration of public affairs are rigidly , and without favor or affection , so to interpret the national will expressed in the laws as that injustice should be done to none , justice to all . This has been the rule upon which they have acted , and thus it is believed that few cases , if any , exist wherein our fellow citizens , who from time to time have been drawn to the seat of Government for the settlement of their transactions with the Government , have gone away dissatisfied . Where the testimony has been perfected and was esteemed satisfactory their claims have been promptly audited , and this in the absence of all favoritism or partiality . The Government which is not just to its own people can neither claim their affection nor the respect of the world . At the same time , the closest attention has been paid to those matters which relate more immediately to the great concerns of the country . Order and efficiency in each branch of the public service have prevailed , accompanied by a system of the most rigid responsibility on the part of the receiving and disbursing agents . The fact , in illustration of the truth of this remark , deserves to be noticed that the revenues of the Government , amounting in the last four years to upward of 120 , 000 , 000 , have been collected and disbursed through the numerous governmental agents without the loss by default of any amount worthy of serious commentary . The appropriations made by Congress for the improvement of the rivers of the West and of the harbors on the Lakes are in a course of judicious expenditure under suitable agents , and are destined , it is to be hoped , to realize all the benefits designed to be accomplished by Congress . I can not , however , sufficiently impress upon Congress the great importance of withholding appropriations from improvements which are not ascertained by previous examination and survey to be necessary for the shelter and protection of trade from the dangers of stores and tempests . Without this precaution the expenditures are but too apt to inure to the benefit of individuals , without reference to the only consideration which can render them constitutional the public interests and the general good . I can not too earnestly urge upon you the interests of this District , over which by the Constitution Congress has exclusive jurisdiction . It would be deeply to be regretted should there be at any time ground to complain of neglect on the part of a community which , detached as it is from the parental care of the States of Virginia and Maryland , can only expect aid from Congress as its local legislature . Amongst the subjects which claim your attention is the prompt organization of an asylum for the insane who may be found from time to time sojourning within the District . Such course is also demanded by considerations which apply to branches of the public service . For the necessities in this behalf I invite your particular attention to the report of the Secretary of the Navy . I have thus , gentlemen of the two Houses of Congress , presented you a true and faithful picture of the condition of public affairs , both foreign and domestic . The wants of the public service are made known to you , and matters of no ordinary importance are urged upon your consideration . Shall I not be permitted to congratulate you on the happy auspices under which you have assembled and at the important change in the condition of things which has occurred in the last three years During that period questions with foreign powers of vital importance to the peace of our country have been settled and adjusted . A desolating and wasting war with savage tribes has been brought to a close . The internal tranquillity of the country , threatened by agitating questions , has been preserved . The credit of the Government , which had experienced a temporary embarrassment , has been thoroughly restored . Its coffers , which for a season were empty , have been replenished . A currency nearly uniform in its value has taken the place of one depreciated and almost worthless . Commerce and manufactures , which had suffered in common with every other interest , have once more revived , and the whole country exhibits an aspect of prosperity and happiness . Trade and barter , no longer governed by a wild and speculative mania , rest upon a solid and substantial footing , and the rapid growth of our cities in every direction bespeaks most strongly the favorable circumstances by which we are surrounded . My happiness in the retirement which shortly awaits me is the ardent hope which I experience that this state of prosperity is neither deceptive nor destined to be short lived , and that measures which have not yet received its sanction , but which I can not but regard as closely connected with the honor , the glory , and still more enlarged prosperity of the country , are destined at an early day to receive the approval of Congress . Under these circumstances and with these anticipations I shall most gladly leave to others more able than myself the noble and pleasing task of sustaining the public prosperity . I shall carry with me into retirement the gratifying reflection that as my sole object throughout has been to advance the public good I may not entirely have failed in accomplishing it and this gratification is heightened in no small degree by the fact that when under a deep and abiding sense of duty I have found myself constrained to resort to the qualified veto it has neither been followed by disapproval on the part of the people nor weakened in any degree their attachment to that great conservative feature of our Government .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States In coming together , fellow citizens , to enter again upon the discharge of the duties with which the people have charged us severally , we find great occasion to rejoice in the general prosperity of the country . We are in the enjoyment of all the blessings of civil and religious liberty , with unexampled means of education , knowledge , and improvement . Through the year which is now drawing to a close peace has been in our borders and plenty in our habitations , and although disease has visited some few portions of the land with distress and mortality , yet in general the health of the people has been preserved , and we are all called upon by the highest obligations of duty to renew our thanks and our devotion to our Heavenly Parent , who has continued to vouchsafe to us the eminent blessings which surround us and who has so signally crowned the year with His goodness . If we find ourselves increasing beyond example in numbers , in strength , in wealth , in knowledge , in everything which promotes human and social happiness , let us ever remember our dependence for all these on the protection and merciful dispensations of Divine Providence . Since your last adjournment Alexander McLeod , a British subject who was indicted for the murder of an American citizen , and whose case has been the subject of a correspondence heretofore communicated to you , has been acquitted by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury , and has under the judgment of the court been regularly discharged . Great Britain having made known to this Government that the expedition which was fitted out from Canada for the destruction of the steamboat Caroline in the winter of 1837 , and which resulted in the destruction of said boat and in the death of an American citizen , was undertaken by orders emanating from the authorities of the British Government in Canada , and demanding the discharge of McLeod upon the ground that if engaged in that expedition he did but fulfill the orders of his Government , has thus been answered in the only way in which she could be answered by a government the powers of which are distributed among its several departments by the fundamental law . Happily for the people of Great Britain , as well as those of the United States , the only mode by which an individual arraigned for a criminal offense before the courts of either can obtain his discharge is by the independent action of the judiciary and by proceedings equally familiar to the courts of both countries . If in Great Britain a power exists in the Crown to cause to be entered a nolle prosequi , which is not the case with the Executive power of the United States upon a prosecution pending in a State court , yet there no more than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody without an order of the proper tribunal directing his discharge . The precise stage of the proceedings at which such order may be made is a matter of municipal regulation exclusively , and not to be complained of by any other government . In cases of this kind a government becomes politically responsible only when its tribunals of last resort are shown to have rendered unjust and injurious judgments in matters not doubtful . To the establishment and elucidation of this principle no nation has lent its authority more efficiently than Great Britain . Alexander McLeod , having his option either to prosecute a writ of error from the decision of the supreme court of New York , which had been rendered upon his application for a discharge , to the Supreme Court of the United States , or to submit his case to the decision of a jury , preferred the latter , deeming it the readiest mode of obtaining his liberation and the result has fully sustained the wisdom of his choice . The manner in which the issue submitted was tried will satisfy the English Government that the principles of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened decision of an American tribunal . I can not fail , however , to suggest to Congress the propriety , and in some degree the necessity , of making such provisions by law , so far as they may constitutionally do so , for the removal at their commencement and at the option of the party of all such cases as may hereafter arise , and which may involve the faithful observance and execution of our international obligations , from the State to the Federal judiciary . This Government , by our institutions , is charged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth , and ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and preserving the other . While just confidence is felt in the judiciary of the States , yet this Government ought to be competent in itself for the fulfillment of the high duties which have been devolved upon it under the organic law by the States themselves . In the month of September a party of armed men from Upper Canada invaded the territory of the United States and forcibly seized upon the person of one Grogan , and under circumstances of great harshness hurriedly carried him beyond the limits of the United States and delivered him np to the authorities of Upper Canada . His immediate discharge was ordered by those authorities upon the facts of the case being brought to their knowledge a course of procedure which was to have been expected from a nation with whom we are at peace , and which was not more due to the rights of the United States than to its own regard for justice . The correspondence which passed between the Department of State and the British envoy , Fox , and with the governor of Vermont , as soon as the facts had been made known to this department , are herewith communicated . I regret that it is not in my power to make known to you an equally satisfactory conclusion in the case of the Caroline steamer , with the circumstances connected with the destruction of which , in December , 1837 , by an armed force fitted out in the Province of Upper Canada , you are already made acquainted . No such atonement as was due for the public wrong done to the United States by this invasion of her territory , so wholly irreconcilable with her rights as an independent power , has yet been made . In the view taken by this Government the inquiry whether the vessel was in the employment of those who were prosecuting an unauthorized war against that Province or was engaged by the owner in the business of transporting passengers to and from Navy Island in hopes of private gain , which was most probably the case , in no degree alters the real question at issue between the two Governments . This Government can never concede to any foreign government the power , except in a case of the most urgent and extreme necessity , of invading its territory , either to arrest the persons or destroy the property of those who may have violated the municipal laws of such foreign government or have disregarded their obligations arising under the law of nations . The territory of the United States must be regarded as sacredly secure against all such invasions until they shall voluntarily acknowledge their inability to acquit themselves of their duties to others . And in announcing this sentiment I do but affirm a principle which no nation on earth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazards than the people and Government of Great Britain . If upon a full investigation of all the facts it shall appear that the owner of the Caroline was governed by a hostile intent or had made common cause with those who were in the occupancy of Navy Island , then so far as he is concerned there can be no claim to indemnity for the destruction of his boat which this Government would feel itself bound to prosecute , since he would have acted not only in derogation of the rights of Great Britain , but in clear violation of the laws of the United States but that is a question which , however settled , in no manner involves the higher consideration of the violation of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction . To recognize it as an admissible practice that each Government in its turn , upon any sudden and unauthorized outbreak which , on a frontier the extent of which renders it impossible for either to have an efficient force on every mile of it , and which outbreak , therefore , neither may be able to suppress in a day , may take vengeance into its own hands , and without even a remonstrance , and in the absence of any pressing or overruling necessity may invade the territory of the other , would inevitably lead to results equally to be deplored by both . When border collisions come to receive the sanction or to be made on the authority of either Government general war must be the inevitable result . While it is the ardent desire of the United States to cultivate the relations of peace with all nations and to fulfill all the duties of good neighborhood toward those who possess territories adjoining their own , that very desire would lead them to deny the right of any foreign power to invade their boundary with an armed force . The correspondence between the two Governments on this subject will at a future day of your session be submitted to your consideration and in the meantime I can not but indulge the hope that the British Government will see the propriety of renouncing as a rule of future action the precedent which has been set in the affair at Schlosser . I herewith submit the correspondence which has recently taken place between the American minister at the Court of James , Stevenson , and the minister of foreign affairs of that Government on the right claimed by that Government to visit and detain vessels sailing under the American flag and engaged in prosecuting lawful commerce in the African seas . Our commercial interests in that region have experienced considerable increase and have become an object of much importance , and it is the duty of this Government to protect them against all improper and vexatious interruption . However desirous the United States may be for the suppression of the slave trade , they can not consent to interpolations into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure of other governments . We deny the right of any such interpolation to any one or all the nations of the earth without our consent . We claim to have a voice in all amendments or alterations of that code , and when we are given to understand , as in this instance , by a foreign government that its treaties with other nations can not be executed without the establishment and enforcement of new principles of maritime police , to be applied without our consent , we must employ a language neither of equivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction . American citizens prosecuting a lawful commerce in the African seas under the flag of their country are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that flag by others nor can they rightfully on account of any such alleged abuses be interrupted , molested , or detained while on the ocean , and if thus molested and detained while pursuing honest voyages in the usual way and violating no law themselves they are unquestionably entitled to indemnity . This Government has manifested its repugnance to the slave trade in a manner which can not be misunderstood . By its fundamental law it prescribed limits in point of time to its continuance , and against its own citizens who might so far forget the rights of humanity as to engage in that wicked traffic it has long since by its municipal laws denounced the most condign punishment . Many of the States composing this Union had made appeals to the civilized world for its suppression long before the moral sense of other nations had become shocked by the iniquities of the traffic . Whether this Government should now enter into treaties containing mutual stipulations upon this subject is a question for its mature deliberation . Certain it is that if the right to detain American ships on the high seas can be justified on the plea of a necessity for such detention arising out of the existence of treaties between other nations , the same plea may , be extended and enlarged by the new stipulations of new treaties to which the United States may not be a party . This Government will not cease to urge upon that of Great Britain full and ample remuneration for all losses , whether arising from detention or otherwise , to which American citizens have heretofore been or may hereafter be subjected by the exercise of rights which this Government can not recognize as legitimate and proper . Nor will I indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of Great Britain will constrain her to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any American citizen engaged in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have experienced at the hands of her cruisers or other public authorities . This Government , at the same time , will relax no effort to prevent its citizens , if there be any so disposed , from prosecuting a traffic so revolting to the feelings of humanity . It seeks to do no more than to protect the fair and honest trader from molestation and injury but while the enterprising mariner engaged in the pursuit of an honorable trade is entitled to its protection , it will visit with condign punishment others of an opposite character . I invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the African slave trade , and recommend all such alterations as may give to them greater force and efficacy . That the American flag is grossly abused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations is but too probable . Congress has not long since had this subject under its consideration , and its importance well justifies renewed and anxious attention . I also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between Stevenson and Lord Palmerston upon the subject , so interesting to several of the Southern States , of the rice duties , which resulted honorably to the justice of Great Britain and advantageously to the United States . At the opening of the last annual session the President informed Congress of the progress which had then been made in negotiating a convention between this Government and that of England with a view to the final settlement of the question of the boundary between the territorial limits of the two countries . I regret to say that little further advancement of the object has been accomplished since last year , but this is owing to circumstances no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both parties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion and to settle the question in dispute as early as possible . In the course of the session it is my hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress toward the accomplishment of this highly desirable end . The commission appointed by this Government for the exploration and survey of the line of boundary separating the States of Maine and New Hampshire from the conterminous British Provinces is , it is believed , about to close its field labors and is expected soon to report the results of its examinations to the Department of State . The report , when received , will be laid before Congress . The failure on the part of Spain to pay with punctuality the interest due under the convention of 1834 for the settlement of claims between the two countries has made it the duty of the Executive to call the particular attention of that Government to the subject . A disposition has been manifested by it , which is believed to be entirely sincere , to fulfill its obligations in this respect so soon as its internal condition and the state of its finances will permit . An arrangement is in progress from the result of which it is trusted that those of our citizens who have claims under the convention will at no distant day receive the stipulated payments . A treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium was concluded and signed at Washington on the 29th of March , 1840 , and was duly sanctioned by the Senate of the United States . The treaty was ratified by His Belgian Majesty , but did not receive the approbation of the Belgian Chambers within the time limited by its terms , and has therefore become void . This occurrence assumes the graver aspect from the consideration that in 1833 a treaty negotiated between the two Governments and ratified on the part of the United States failed to be ratified on the part of Belgium . The representative of that Government at Washington informs the Department of State that he has been instructed to give explanations of the causes which occasioned delay in the approval of the late treaty by the legislature , and to express the regret of the King at the occurrence . The joint commission under the convention with Texas to ascertain the true boundary between the two countries has concluded its labors , but the final report of the commissioner of the United States has not been received . It is understood , however , that the meridian line as traced by the commission lies somewhat farther east than the position hitherto generally assigned to it , and consequently includes in Texas some part of the territory which had been considered as belonging to the States of Louisiana and Arkansas . The United States can not but take a deep interest in whatever relates to this young but growing Republic . Settled principally by emigrants from the United States , we have the happiness to know that the great principles of civil liberty are there destined to flourish under wise institutions and wholesome laws , and that through its example another evidence is to be afforded of the capacity of popular institutions to advance the prosperity , happiness , and permanent glory of the human race . The great truth that government was made for the people and not the people for government has already been established in the practice and by the example of these United States , and we can do no other than contemplate its further exemplification by a sister republic with the deepest interest . Our relations with the independent States of this hemisphere , formerly under the dominion of Spain , have not undergone any material change within the past year . The incessant sanguinary conflicts in or between those countries are to be greatly deplored as necessarily tending to disable them from performing their duty as members of the community of nations and rising to the destiny which the position and natural resources of many of them might lead them justly to anticipate , as constantly giving occasion also , directly or indirectly , for complaints on the part of our citizens who resort thither for purposes of commercial intercourse , and as retarding reparation for wrongs already committed , some of which are by no means of recent date . The failure of the Congress of Ecuador to hold a session at the time appointed for that purpose , in January last , will probably render abortive a treaty of commerce with that Republic , which was signed at Quito on the 13th of June , 1839 , and had been duly ratified on our part , but which required the approbation of that body prior to its ratification by the Ecuadorian Executive . A convention which has been concluded with the Republic of Peru , providing for the settlement of certain claims of citizens of the United States upon the Government of that Republic , will be duly submitted to the Senate . The claims of our citizens against the Brazilian Government originating from captures and other causes are still unsatisfied . The United States have , however , so uniformly shown a disposition to cultivate relations of amity with that Empire that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens of the same spirit toward us which an adjustment of the affairs referred to would afford will be given without further avoidable delay . The war with the Indian tribes on the peninsula of Florida has during the last summer and fall been prosecuted with untiring activity and zeal . A summer campaign was resolved upon as the best mode of bringing it to a close . Our brave officers and men who have been engaged in that service have suffered toils and privations and exhibited an energy which in any other war would have won for them unfading laurels . In despite of the sickness incident to the climate , they have penetrated the fastnesses of the Indians , broken up their encampments , and harassed them unceasingly . Numbers have been captured , and still greater numbers have surrendered and have been transported to join their brethren on the lands elsewhere allotted to them by the Government , and a strong hope is entertained that under the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of the troops in Florida that troublesome and expensive war is destined to a speedy termination . With all the other Indian tribes we are enjoying the blessings of peace . Our duty as well as our best interests prompts us to observe in all our intercourse with them fidelity in fulfilling our engagements , the practice of strict justice , as well as the constant exercise of acts of benevolence and kindness . These are the great instruments of civilization , and through the use of them alone can the untutored child of the forest be induced to listen to its teachings . The Secretary of State , on whom the acts of Congress have devolved the duty of directing the proceedings for the taking of the sixth census or enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States , will report to the two Houses the progress of that work . The enumeration of persons has been completed , and exhibits a grand total of 17 , 069 , 453 , making an increase over the census of 1830 of 4 , 202 , 646 inhabitants , and showing a gain in a ratio exceeding 32 1 2 per cent for the last ten years . From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will be informed of the condition of the finances . The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last , as stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury submitted to Congress at the extra session , was 987 , 345 . 03 . The receipts into the Treasury during the first three quarters of this year from all sources amount to 23 , 467 , 072 . 52 the estimated receipts for the fourth quarter amount to 6 , 943 , 095 . 25 , amounting to 30 , 410 , 167 . 77 , and making with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last 31 , 397 , 512 . 80 . The expenditures for the first three quarters of this year amount to 24 , 734 , 346 . 97 . The expenditures for the fourth quarter as estimated will amount to 7 , 290 , 723 . 73 , thus making a total of 32 , 025 , 070 . 70 , and leaving a deficit to be provided for on the 1st of January next of about 627 , 557 . 90 . Of the loan of 12 , 000 , 000 which was authorized by Congress at its late session only 5 , 432 , 726 . 88 have been negotiated . The shortness of time which it had to run has presented no inconsiderable impediment in the way of its being taken by capitalists at home , while the same cause would have operated with much greater force in the foreign market . For that reason the foreign market has not been resorted to and it is now submitted whether it would not be advisable to amend the law by making what remains undisposed of payable at a more distant day . Should it be necessary , in any view that Congress may take of the subject , to revise the existing tariff of duties , I beg leave to say that in the performance of that most delicate operation moderate counsels would seem to be the wisest . The Government under which it is our happiness to live owes its existence to the spirit of compromise which prevailed among its framers jarring and discordant opinions could only have been reconciled by that noble spirit of patriotism which prompted conciliation and resulted in harmony . In the same spirit the compromise bill , as it is commonly called , was adopted at the session of 1833 . While the people of no portion of the Union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxes for the support of Government , yet an innate repugnance exists to the imposition of burthens not really necessary for that object . In imposing duties , however , for the purposes of revenue a right to discriminate as to the articles on which the duty shall be laid , as well as the amount , necessarily and most properly exists otherwise the Government would be placed in the condition of having to levy the same duties upon all articles , the productive as well as the unproductive . The slightest duty upon some might have the effect of causing their importation to cease , whereas others , entering extensively into the consumption of the country , might bear the heaviest without any sensible diminution in the amount imported . So also the Government may be justified in so discriminating by reference to other considerations of domestic policy connected with our manufactures . So long as the duties shall be laid with distinct reference to the wants of the Treasury no well rounded objection can exist against them . It might be esteemed desirable that no such augmentation of the taxes should take place as would have the effect of annulling the land proceeds distribution act of the last session , which act is declared to be inoperative the moment the duties are increased beyond 20 per cent , the maximum rate established by the compromise act . Some of the provisions of the compromise act , which will go into effect on the 30th day of June next , may , however , be found exceedingly inconvenient in practice under any regulations that Congress may adopt . I refer more particularly to that relating to the home valuation . A difference in value of the same articles to some extent will necessarily exist at different ports , but that is altogether insignificant when compared with the conflicts in valuation which are likely to arise from the differences of opinion among the numerous appraisers of merchandise . In many instances the estimates of value must be conjectural , and thus as many different rates of value may be established as there are appraisers . These differences in valuation may also be increased by the inclination which , without the slightest imputation on their honesty , may arise on the part of the appraisers in favor of their respective ports of entry . I recommend this whole subject to the consideration of Congress with a single additional remark . Certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy are in all respects eminently desirable , but more particularly is this true in all that affects trade and commerce , the operations of which depend much more on the certainty of their returns and calculations which embrace distant periods of time than on high bounties or duties , which are liable to constant fluctuations . At your late session I invited your attention to the condition of the currency and exchanges and urged the necessity of adopting such measures as were consistent with the constitutional competency of the Government in order to correct the unsoundness of the one and , as far as practicable , the inequalities of the other . No country can be in the enjoyment of its full measure of prosperity without the presence of a medium of exchange approximating to uniformity of value . What is necessary as between the different nations of the earth is also important as between the inhabitants of different parts of the same country . With the first the precious metals constitute the chief medium of circulation , and such also would be the case as to the last but for inventions comparatively modern , which have furnished in place of gold and silver a paper circulation . I do not propose to enter into a comparative analysis of the merits of the two systems . Such belonged more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system . The speculative philosopher might find inducements to prosecute the inquiry , but his researches could only lead him to conclude that the paper system had probably better never have been introduced and that society might have been much happier without it . The practical statesman has a very different task to perform . He has to look at things as they are , to take them as he finds them , to supply deficiencies and to prune excesses as far as in him lies . The task of furnishing a corrective for derangements of the paper medium with us is almost inexpressibly great . The power exerted by the States to charter banking corporations , and which , having been carried to a great excess , has filled the country with , in most of the States , an irredeemable paper medium , is an evil which in some way or other requires a corrective . The rates at which bills of exchange are negotiated between different parts of the country furnish an index of the value of the local substitute for gold and silver , which is in many parts so far depreciated as not to be received except at a large discount in payment of debts or in the purchase of produce . It could earnestly be desired that every bank not possessing the means of resumption should follow the example of the late United States Bank of Pennsylvania and go into liquidation rather than by refusing to do so to continue embarrassments in the way of solvent institutions , thereby augmenting the difficulties incident to the present condition of things . Whether this Government , with due regard to the rights of the States , has any power to constrain the banks either to resume specie payments or to force them into liquidation , is an inquiry which will not fail to claim your consideration . In view of the great advantages which are allowed the corporators , not among the least of which is the authority contained in most of their charters to make loans to three times the amount of their capital , thereby often deriving three times as much interest on the same amount of money as any individual is permitted by law to receive , no sufficient apology can be urged for a long continued suspension of specie payments . Such suspension is productive of the greatest detriment to the public by expelling from circulation the precious metals and seriously hazarding the success of any effort that this Government can make to increase commercial facilities and to advance the public interests . This is the more to be regretted and the indispensable necessity for a sound currency becomes the more manifest when we reflect on the vast amount of the internal commerce of the country . Of this we have no statistics nor just data for forming adequate opinions . But there can be no doubt but that the amount of transportation coastwise by sea , and the transportation inland by railroads and canals , and by steamboats and other modes of conveyance over the surface of our vast rivers and immense lakes , and the value of property carried and interchanged by these means form a general aggregate to which the foreign commerce of the country , large as it is , makes but a distant approach . In the absence of any controlling power over this subject , which , by forcing a general resumption of specie payments , would at once have the effect of restoring a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the country but little to desire , what measure of relief falling within the limits of our constitutional competency does it become this Government to adopt It was my painful duty at your last session , under the weight of most solemn obligations , to differ with Congress on the measures which it proposed for my approval , and which it doubtless regarded as corrective of existing evils . Subsequent reflection and events since occurring have only served to confirm me in the opinions then entertained and frankly expressed . I must be permitted to add that no scheme of governmental policy unaided by individual exertions can be available for ameliorating the present condition of things . Commercial modes of exchange and a good currency are but the necessary means of commerce and intercourse , not the direct productive sources of wealth . Wealth can only be accumulated by the earnings of industry and the savings of frugality , and nothing can be more ill judged than to look to facilities in borrowing or to a redundant circulation for the power of discharging pecuniary obligations . The country is full of resources and the people fall of energy , and the great and permanent remedy for present embarrassments must be sought in industry , economy , the observance of good faith , and the favorable influence of time . In pursuance of a pledge given to you in my last message to Congress , which pledge I urge as an apology for adventuring to present you the details of any plan , the Secretary of the Treasury will be ready to submit to you , should you require it , a plan of finance which , while it throws around the public treasure reasonable guards for its protection and rests on powers acknowledged in practice to exist from the origin of the Government , will at the same time furnish to the country a sound paper medium and afford all reasonable facilities for regulating the exchanges . When submitted , you will perceive in it a plan amendatory of the existing laws in relation to the Treasury Department , subordinate in all respects to the will of Congress directly and the will of the people indirectly , self sustaining should it be found in practice to realize its promises in theory , and repealable at the pleasure of Congress . It proposes by effectual restraints and by invoking the true spirit of our institutions to separate the purse from the sword , or , more properly to speak , denies any other control to the President over the agents who may be selected to carry it into execution but what may be indispensably necessary to secure the fidelity of such agents , and by wise regulations keeps plainly apart from each other private and public funds . It contemplates the establishment of a board of control at the seat of government , with agencies at prominent commercial points or wherever else Congress shall direct , for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public moneys and a substitution at the option of the public creditor of Treasury notes in lieu of gold and silver . It proposes to limit the issues to an amount not to exceed 15 , 000 , 000 without the express sanction of the legislative power . It also authorizes the receipt of individual deposits of gold and silver to a limited amount , and the granting certificates of deposit divided into such sums as may be called for by the depositors . It proceeds a step further and authorizes the purchase and sale of domestic bills and drafts resting on a real and substantial basis , payable at sight or having but a short time to run , and drawn on places not less than 100 miles apart , which authority , except in so far as may be necessary for Government purposes exclusively , is only to be exerted upon the express condition that its exercise shall not be prohibited by the State in which the agency is situated . In order to cover the expenses incident to the plan , it will be authorized to receive moderate premiums for certificates issued on deposits and on bills bought and sold , and thus , as far as its dealings extend , to furnish facilities to commercial intercourse at the lowest possible rates and to subduct from the earnings of industry the least possible sum . It uses the State banks at a distance from the agencies as auxiliaries without imparting any power to trade in its name . It is subjected to such guards and restraints as have appeared to be necessary . It is the creature of law and exists only at the pleasure of the Legislature . It is made to rest on an actual specie basis in order to redeem the notes at the places of issue , produces no dangerous redundancy of circulation , affords no temptation to speculation , is attended by no inflation of prices , is equable in its operation , makes the Treasury notes which it may use along with the certificates of deposit and the notes of specie paying banks convertible at the place where collected , receivable in payment of Government dues , and without violating any principle of the Constitution affords the Government and the people such facilities as are called for by the wants of both . Such , it has appeared to me , are its recommendations , and in view of them it will be submitted , whenever you may require it , to your consideration . I am not able to perceive that any fair and candid objection can be urged against the plan , the principal outlines of which I have thus presented . I can not doubt but that the notes which it proposes to furnish at the voluntary option of the public creditor , issued in lieu of the revenue and its certificates of deposit , will be maintained at an equality with gold and silver everywhere . They are redeemable in gold and silver on demand at the places of issue . They are receivable everywhere in payment of Government dues . The Treasury notes are limited to an amount of one fourth less than the estimated annual receipts of the Treasury , and in addition they rest upon the faith of the Government for their redemption . If all these assurances are not sufficient to make them available , then the idea , as it seems to me , of furnishing a sound paper medium of exchange may be entirely abandoned . If a fear be indulged that the Government may be tempted to run into excess in its issues at any future day , it seems to me that no such apprehension can reasonably be entertained until all confidence in the representatives of the States and of the people , as well as of the people themselves , shall be lost . The weightiest considerations of policy require that the restraints now proposed to be thrown around the measure should not for light causes be removed . To argue against any proposed plan its liability to possible abuse is to reject every expedient , since everything dependent on human action is liable to abuse . Fifteen millions of Treasury notes may be issued as the maximum , but a discretionary power is to be given to the board of control under that sum , and every consideration will unite in leading them to feel their way with caution . For the first eight years of the existence of the late Bank of the United States its circulation barely exceeded 4 , 000 , 000 , and for five of its most prosperous years it was about equal to 16 , 000 , 000 furthermore , the authority given to receive private deposits to a limited amount and to issue certificates in such sums as may be called for by the depositors may so far fill up the channels of circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity of any considerable issue of Treasury notes . A restraint upon the amount of private deposits has seemed to be indispensably necessary from an apprehension , thought to be well founded , that in any emergency of trade confidence might be so far shaken in the banks as to induce a withdrawal from them of private deposits with a view to insure their unquestionable safety when deposited with the Government , which might prove eminently disastrous to the State banks . Is it objected that it is proposed to authorize the agencies to deal in bills of exchange It is answered that such dealings are to be carried on at the lowest possible premium , are made to rest on an unquestionably sound basis , are designed to reimburse merely the expenses which would otherwise devolve upon the Treasury , and are in strict subordination to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Bank of Augusta against Earle , and other reported cases , and thereby avoids all conflict with State jurisdiction , which I hold to be indispensably requisite . It leaves the banking privileges of the States without interference , looks to the Treasury and the Union , and while furnishing every facility to the first is careful of the interests of the last . But above all , it is created by law , is amendable by law , and is repealable by law , and , wedded as I am to no theory , but looking solely to the advancement of the public good , I shall be among the very first to urge its repeal if it be found not to subserve the purposes and objects for which it may be created . Nor will the plan be submitted in any overweening confidence in the sufficiency of my own judgment , but with much greater reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of Congress . I can not abandon this subject without urging upon you in the most emphatic manner , whatever may be your action on the suggestions which I have felt it to be my duty to submit , to relieve the Chief Executive Magistrate , by any and all constitutional means , from a controlling power over the public Treasury . If in the plan proposed , should you deem it worthy of your consideration , that separation is not as complete as you may desire , you will doubtless amend it in that particular . For myself , I disclaim all desire to have any control over the public moneys other than what is indispensably necessary to execute the laws which you may pass . Nor can I fail to advert in this connection to the debts which many of the States of the Union have contracted abroad and under which they continue to labor . That indebtedness amounts to a sum not less than 200 , 000 , 000 , and which has been retributed to them for the most part in works of internal improvement which are destined to prove of vast importance in ultimately advancing their prosperity and wealth . For the debts thus contracted the States are alone responsible . I can do not more than express the belief that each State will feel itself bound by every consideration of honor as well as of interest to meet its engagements with punctuality . The failure , however , of any one State to do so should in no degree affect the credit of the rest , and the foreign capitalist will have no just cause to experience alarm as to all other State stocks because any one or more of the States may neglect to provide with punctuality the means of redeeming their engagements . Even such States , should there be any , considering the great rapidity with which their resources are developing themselves , will not fail to have the means at no very distant day to redeem their obligations to the uttermost farthing nor will I doubt but that , in view of that honorable conduct which has evermore governed the States and the people of the Union , they will each and all resort to every legitimate expedient before they will forego a faithful compliance with their obligations . From the report of the Secretary of War and other reports accompanying it you will be informed of the progress which has been made in the fortifications designed for the protection of our principal cities , roadsteads , and inland frontier during the present year , together with their true state and condition . They will be prosecuted to completion with all the expedition which the means placed by Congress at the disposal of the Executive will allow . I recommend particularly to your consideration that portion of the Secretary s report which proposes the establishment of a chain of military posts from Council Bluffs to some point on the Pacific Ocean within our limits . The benefit thereby destined to accrue to our citizens engaged in the fur trade over that wilderness region , added to the importance of cultivating friendly relations with savage tribes inhabiting it , and at the same time of giving protection to our frontier settlements and of establishing the means of safe intercourse between the American settlements at the mouth of the Columbia River and those on this side of the Rocky Mountains , would seem to suggest the importance of carrying into effect the recommendations upon this head with as little delay as may be practicable . The report of the Secretary of the Navy will place you in possession of the present condition of that important arm of the national defense . Every effort will be made to add to its efficiency , and I can not too strongly urge upon you liberal appropriations to that branch of the public service . Inducements of the weightiest character exist for the adoption of this course of policy . Our extended and otherwise exposed maritime frontier calls for protection , to the furnishing of which an efficient naval force is indispensable . We look to no foreign conquests , nor do we propose to enter into competition with any other nation for supremacy on the ocean but it is due not only to the honor but to the security of the people of the United States that no nation should be permitted to invade our waters at pleasure and subject our towns and villages to conflagration or pillage . Economy in all branches of the public service is due from all the public agents to the people , but parsimony alone would suggest the withholding of the necessary means for the protection of our domestic firesides from invasion and our national honor from disgrace . I would most earnestly recommend to Congress to abstain from all appropriations for objects not absolutely necessary but I take upon myself , without a moment of hesitancy , all the responsibility of recommending the increase and prompt equipment of that gallant Navy which has lighted up every sea with its victories and spread an imperishable glory over the country . The report of the Postmaster General will claim your particular attention , not only because of the valuable suggestions which it contains , but because of the great importance which at all times attaches to that interesting branch of the public service . The increased expense of transporting the mail along the principal routes necessarily claims the public attention , and has awakened a corresponding solicitude on the part of the Government . The transmission of the mail must keep pace with those facilities of intercommunication which are every day becoming greater through the building of railroads and the application of steam power , but it can not be disguised that in order to do so the Post Office Department is subjected to heavy exactions . The lines of communication between distant parts of the Union are to a great extent occupied by railroads , which , in the nature of things , possess a complete monopoly , and the Department is therefore liable to heavy and unreasonable charges . This evil is destined to great increase in future , and some timely measure may become necessary to guard against it . I feel it my duty to bring under your consideration a practice which has grown up in the administration of the Government , and which , I am deeply convinced , ought to be corrected . I allude to the exercise of the power which usage rather than reason has vested in the Presidents of removing incumbents from office in order to substitute others more in favor with the dominant party . My own conduct in this respect has been governed by a conscientious purpose to exercise the removing power only in cases of unfaithfulness or inability , or in those in which its exercise appeared necessary in order to discountenance and suppress that spirit of active partisanship on the part of holders of office which not only withdraws them from the steady and impartial discharge of their official duties , but exerts an undue and injurious influence over elections and degrades the character of the Government itself , inasmuch as it exhibits the Chief Magistrate as being a party through his agents in the secret plots or open workings of political parties . In respect to the exercise of this power nothing should be left to discretion which may safely be regulated by law , and it is of high importance to restrain as far as possible the stimulus of personal interests in public elections . Considering the great increase which has been made in public offices in the last quarter of a century and the probability of further increase , we incur the hazard of witnessing violent political contests , directed too often to the single object of retaining office by those who are in or obtaining it by those who are out . Under the influence of these convictions I shall cordially concur in any constitutional measure for regulating and , by regulating , restraining the power of removal . I suggest for your consideration the propriety of making without further delay some specific application of the funds derived under the will of Smithson , of England , for the diffusion of knowledge , and which have heretofore been vested in public stocks until such time as Congress should think proper to give them a specific direction . Nor will you , I feel confident , permit any abatement of the principal of the legacy to be made should it turn out that the stocks in which the investments have been made have undergone a depreciation . In conclusion I commend to your care the interests of this District , for which you are the exclusive legislators . Considering that this city is the residence of the Government and for a large part of the year of Congress , and considering also the great cost of the public buildings and the propriety of affording them at all times careful protection , it seems not unreasonable that Congress should contribute toward the expense of an efficient police .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 23d of March last , requesting the President to lay before the House the authority and the true copies of all requests and applications upon which he deemed it his duty to interfere with the naval and military forces of the United States on the occasion of the recent attempt of the people of Rhode Island to establish a free constitution in the place of the old charter government of that State also copies of the instructions to and statements of the charter commissioners sent to him by the then existing authorities of the State of Rhode Island also copies of the correspondence between the Executive of the United States and the charter government of the State of Rhode Island , and all the papers and documents connected with the same also copies of the correspondence , if any , between the heads of Departments and said charter government or any person or persons connected with the said government , and of any accompanying papers and documents also copies of all orders issued by the Executive of the United States , or any of the Departments , to military officers for the movement or employment of troops to or in Rhode Island also copies of all orders to naval officers to prepare steam or other vessels of the United States for service in the waters of Rhode Island also copies of all orders to the officers of revenue cutters for the same service also copies of any instructions borne by the Secretary of War to Rhode Island on his visit in 1842 to review the troops of the charter government also copies of any order or orders to any officer or officers of the Army or Navy to report themselves to the charter government and that he be requested to lay before this House copies of any other papers or documents in the possession of the Executive connected with this subject not above specifically enumerated , I have to inform the House that the Executive did not deem it his duty to interfere with the naval and military forces of the United States in the late disturbances in Rhode Island that no orders were issued by the Executive or any of the Departments to military officers for the movement or employment of troops to or in Rhode Island other than those which accompany this message and which contemplated the strengthening of the garrison at Fort Adams , which , considering the extent of the agitation in Rhode Island , was esteemed necessary and judicious that no orders were issued to naval officers to prepare steam or other vessels of the United States for service in the waters of Rhode Island that no orders were issued to the officers of the revenue cutters for said service that no instructions were borne by the Secretary of War to Rhode Island on his visit in 1842 to review the troops of the charter government that no orders were given to any officer or officers of the Army or Navy to report themselves to the charter government that requests and applications were made to the Executive to fulfill the guaranties of the Constitution which impose on the Federal Government the obligation to protect and defend each State of the Union against domestic violence and foreign invasion , but the Executive was at no time convinced that the casus faederis had arisen which required the interposition of the military or naval power in the controversy which unhappily existed between the people of Rhode Island . I was in no manner prevented from so interfering by the inquiry whether Rhode Island existed as an independent State of the Union under a charter granted at an early period by the Crown of Great Britain or not . It was enough for the Executive to know that she was recognized as a sovereign State by Great Britain by the treaty of 1783 that at a later day she had in common with her sister States poured out her blood and freely expended her treasure in the War of the Revolution that she was a party to the Articles of Confederation that at an after period she adopted the Constitution of the United States as a free , independent , and republican State and that in this character she has always possessed her full quota of representation in the Senate and House of Representatives and that up to a recent day she has conducted all her domestic affairs and fulfilled all her obligations as a member of the Union , in peace and war , under her charter government , as it is denominated by the resolution of the House of the 23d March . I must be permitted to disclaim entirely and unqualifiedly the right on the part of the Executive to make any real or supposed defects existing in any State constitution or form of government the pretext for a failure to enforce the laws or the guaranties of the Constitution of the United States in reference to any such State . I utterly repudiate the idea , in terms as emphatic as I can employ , that those laws are not to be enforced or those guaranties complied with because the President may believe that the right of suffrage or any other great popular right is either too restricted or too broadly enlarged . I also with equal strength resist the idea that it fails within the Executive competency to decide in controversies of the nature of that which existed in Rhode Island on which side is the majority of the people or as to the extent of the rights of a mere numerical majority . For the Executive to assume such a power would be to assume a power of the most dangerous character . Under such assumptions the States of this Union would have no security for peace or tranquillity , but might be converted into the mere instruments of Executive will . Actuated by selfish purposes , he might become the great agitator , fomenting assaults upon the State constitutions and declaring the majority of to day to be the minority of to morrow , and the minority , in its turn , the majority , before whose decrees the established order of things in the State should be subverted . Revolution , civil commotion , and bloodshed would be the inevitable consequences . The provision in the Constitution intended for the security of the States would thus be turned into the instrument of their destruction . The President would become , in fact , the great constitution maker for the States , and all power would be vested in his hands . When , therefore , the governor of Rhode Island , by his letter of the 4th of April , 1842 , made a requisition upon the Executive for aid to put down the late disturbances , I had no hesitation in recognizing the obligations of the Executive to furnish such aid upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for by the Constitution and laws . My letter of the 11th of April , in reply to the governor s letter of the 4th , is herewith communicated , together with all correspondence which passed at a subsequent day and the letters and documents mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed . From the correspondence between the Executive of the United States and that of Rhode Island , it will not escape observation that while I regarded it as my duty to announce the principles by which I should govern myself in the contingency of an armed interposition on the part of this Government being necessary to uphold the rights of the State of Rhode Island and to preserve its domestic peace , yet that the strong hope was indulged and expressed that all the difficulties would disappear before an enlightened policy of conciliation and compromise . In that spirit I addressed to Governor King the letter of the 9th of May , 1842 , marked private and confidential , and received his reply of the 12th of May of the same year . The desire of the Executive was from the beginning to bring the dispute to a termination without the interposition of the military power of the United States , and it will continue to be a subject of self congratulation that this leading object of policy was finally accomplished . The Executive resisted all entreaties , however urgent , to depart from this line of conduct . Information from private sources had led the Executive to conclude that little else was designed by Dorr and his adherents than mere menace with a view to intimidation nor was this opinion in any degree shaken until the 22d of June , 1842 , when it was strongly represented from reliable sources , as will be seen by reference to the documents herewith communicated , that preparations were making by Dorr , with a large force in arms , to invade the State , which force had been recruited in the neighboring States and had been already preceded by the collection of military stores in considerable quantities at one or two points . This was a state of things to which the Executive could not be indifferent . Dorr speedily afterwards took up his headquarters at Chepachet and assumed the command of what was reported to be a large force , drawn chiefly from voluntary enlistments made in neighboring States . The Executive could with difficulty bring itself to realize the fact that the citizens of other States should have forgotten their duty to themselves and the Constitution of the United States and have entered into the highly reprehensible and indefensible course of interfering so far in the concerns of a sister State as to have entered into plans of invasion , conquest , and revolution but the Executive felt it to be its duty to look minutely into the matter , and therefore the Secretary of War was dispatched to Rhode Island with instructions a copy of which is herewith transmitted , and was authorized , should a requisition be made upon the Executive by the government of Rhode Island in pursuance of law , and the invaders should not abandon their purposes , to call upon the governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut for a sufficient number of militia at once to arrest the invasion and to interpose such of the regular troops as could be spared from Fort Adams for the defense of the city of Providence in the event of its being attacked , as was strongly represented to be in contemplation . Happily there was no necessity for either issuing the proclamation or the requisition or for removing the troops from Fort Adams , where they had been properly stationed . Chepachet was evacuated and Dorr s troops dispersed without the necessity of the interposition of any military force by this Government , thus confirming me in my early impressions that nothing more had been designed from the first by those associated with Dorr than to excite fear and apprehension and thereby to obtain concessions from the constituted authorities which might be claimed as a triumph over the existing government . With the dispersion of Dorr s troops ended all difficulties . A convention was shortly afterwards called , by due course of law , to amend the fundamental law , and a new constitution , based on more liberal principles than that abrogated , was proposed , and adopted by the people . Thus the great American experiment of a change in government under the influence of opinion and not of force has been again crowned with success , and the State and people of Rhode Island repose in safety under institutions of their own adoption , unterrified by any future prospect of necessary change and secure against domestic violence and invasion from abroad . I congratulate the country upon so happy a termination of a condition of things which seemed at one time seriously to threaten the public peace . It may justly be regarded as worthy of the age and of the country in which we live .<speech_sep>
