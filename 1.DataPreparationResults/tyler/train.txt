To the People of the United States FELLOW CITIZENBefore my arrival at the seat of Government the painful communication was made to you by the officers presiding over the several Departments of the deeply regretted death of William Henry Harrison , late President of the United States . Upon him you had conferred your suffrages for the first office in your gift , and had selected him as your chosen instrument to correct and reform all such errors and abuses as had manifested themselves from time to time in the practical operation of the Government . While standing at the threshold of this great work he has by the dispensation of an all wise Providence been removed from amongst us , and by the provisions of the Constitution the efforts to be directed to the accomplishing of this vitally important task have devolved upon myself . This same occurrence has subjected the wisdom and sufficiency of our institutions to a new test . For the first time in our history the person elected to the Vice Presidency of the United States , by the happening of a contingency provided for in the Constitution , has had devolved upon him the Presidential office . The spirit of faction , which is directly opposed to the spirit of a lofty patriotism , may find in this occasion for assaults upon my Administration and in succeeding , under circumstances so sudden and unexpected and to responsibilities so greatly augmented , to the administration of public affairs I shall place in the intelligence and patriotism of the people my only sure reliance . My earnest prayer shall be constantly addressed to the all wise and all powerful Being who made me , and by whose dispensation I am called to the high office of President of this Confederacy , understandingly to carry out the principles of that Constitution which I have sworn to protect , preserve , and defend . The usual opportunity which is afforded to a Chief Magistrate upon his induction to office of presenting to his countrymen an exposition of the policy which would guide his Administration , in the form of an inaugural address , not having , under the peculiar circumstances which have brought me to the discharge of the high duties of President of the United States , been afforded to me , a brief exposition of the principles which will govern me in the general course of my administration of public affairs would seem to be due as well to myself as to you . In regard to foreign nations , the groundwork of my policy will be justice on our part to all , submitting to injustice from none . While I shall sedulously cultivate the relations of peace and amity with one and all , it will be my most imperative duty to see that the honor of the country shall sustain no blemish . With a view to this , the condition of our military defenses will become a matter of anxious solicitude . The Army , which has in other days covered itself with renown , and the Navy , not inappropriately termed the right arm of the public defense , which has spread a light of glory over the American standard in all the waters of the earth , should be rendered replete with efficiency . In view of the fact , well avouched by history , that the tendency of all human institutions is to concentrate power in the hands of a single man , and that their ultimate downfall has proceeded from this cause , I deem it of the most essential importance that a complete separation should take place between the sword and the purse . No matter where or how the public moneys shall be deposited , so long as the President can exert the power of appointing and removing at his pleasure the agents selected for their custody the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy is in fact the treasurer . A permanent and radical change should therefore be decreed . The patronage incident to the Presidential office , already great , is constantly increasing . Such increase is destined to keep pace with the growth of our population , until , without a figure of speech , an army of officeholders may be spread over the land . The unrestrained power exerted by a selfishly ambitious man in order either to perpetuate his authority or to hand it over to some favorite as his successor may lead to the employment of all the means within his control to accomplish his object . The right to remove from office , while subjected to no just restraint , is inevitably destined to produce a spirit of crouching servility with the official corps , which , in order to uphold the hand which feeds them , would lead to direct and active interference in the elections , both State and Federal , thereby subjecting the course of State legislation to the dictation of the chief executive officer and making the will of that officer absolute and supreme . I will at a proper time invoke the action of Congress upon this subject , and shall readily acquiesce in the adoption of all proper measures which are calculated to arrest these evils , so full of danger in their tendency . I will remove no incumbent from office who has faithfully and honestly acquitted himself of the duties of his office , except in such cases where such officer has been guilty of an active partisanship or by secret means the less manly , and therefore the more objectionable has given his official influence to the purposes of party , thereby bringing the patronage of the Government in conflict with the freedom of elections . Numerous removals may become necessary under this rule . These will be made by me through no acerbity of feeling I have had no cause to cherish or indulge unkind feelings toward any but my conduct will be regulated by a profound sense of what is due to the country and its institutions nor shall I neglect to apply the same unbending rule to those of my own appointment . Freedom of opinion will be tolerated , the full enjoyment of the right of suffrage will be maintained as the birthright of every American citizen but I say emphatically to the official corps , Thus far and no farther . I have dwelt the longer upon this subject because removals from office are likely often to arise , and I would have my countrymen to understand the principle of the Executive action . In all public expenditures the most rigid economy should be resorted to , and , as one of its results , a public debt in time of peace be sedulously avoided . A wise and patriotic constituency will never object to the imposition of necessary burdens for useful ends , and true wisdom dictates the resort to such means in order to supply deficiencies in the revenue , rather than to those doubtful expedients which , ultimating in a public debt , serve to embarrass the resources of the country and to lessen its ability to meet any great emergency which may arise . All sinecures should be abolished . The appropriations should be direct and explicit , so as to leave as limited a share of discretion to the disbursing agents as may be found compatible with the public service . A strict responsibility on the part of all the agents of the Government should be maintained and peculation or defalcation visited with immediate expulsion from office and the most condign punishment . The public interest also demands that if any war has existed between the Government and the currency it shall cease . Measures of a financial character now having the sanction of legal enactment shall be faithfully enforced until repealed by the legislative authority . But I owe it to myself to declare that I regard existing enactments as unwise and impolitic and in a high degree oppressive . I shall promptly give my sanction to any constitutional measure which , originating in Congress , shall have for its object the restoration of a sound circulating medium , so essentially necessary to give confidence in all the transactions of life , to secure to industry its just and adequate rewards , and to reestablish the public prosperity . In deciding upon the adaptation of any such measure to the end proposed , as well as its conformity to the Constitution , I shall resort to the fathers of the great republican school for advice and instruction , to be drawn from their sage views of our system of government and the light of their ever glorious example . The institutions under which we live , my countrymen , secure each person in the perfect enjoyment of all his rights . The spectacle is exhibited to the world of a government deriving its powers from the consent of the governed and having imparted to it only so much power as is necessary for its successful operation . Those who are charged with its administration should carefully abstain from all attempts to enlarge the range of powers thus granted to the several departments of the Government other than by an appeal to the people for additional grants , lest by so doing they disturb that balance which the patriots and statesmen who framed the Constitution designed to establish between the Federal Government and the States composing the Union . The observance of these rules is enjoined upon us by that feeling of reverence and affection which finds a place in the heart of every patriot for the preservation of union and the blessings of union for the good of our children and our children s children through countless generations . An opposite course could not fail to generate factions intent upon the gratification of their selfish ends , to give birth to local and sectional jealousies , and to ultimate either in breaking asunder the bonds of union or in building up a central system which would inevitably end in a bloody scepter and an iron crown . In conclusion I beg you to be assured that I shall exert myself to carry the foregoing principles into practice during my administration of the Government , and , confiding in the protecting care of an everwatchful and overruling Providence , it shall be my first and highest duty to preserve unimpaired the free institutions under which we live and transmit them to those who shall succeed me in their full force and vigor .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives of the United States It is with unfeigned regret that I find myself under the necessity of returning to the House of Representatives with my objections a bill entitled An act to provide revenue from imports , and to change and modify existing laws imposing duties on imports , and for other purposes . Nothing can be more painful to any individual called upon to perform the Chief Executive duties under our limited Constitution than to be constrained to withhold his assent from an important measure adopted by the Legislature . Yet he would neither fulfill the high purposes of his station nor consult the true interests or the solemn will of the people the common constituents of both branches of the Government by yielding his well considered , most deeply fixed , and repeatedly declared opinions on matters of great public concernment to those of a coordinate department without requesting that department seriously to reexamine the subject of their difference . The exercise of some independence of judgment in regard to all acts of legislation is plainly implied in the responsibility of approving them . At all times a duty , it becomes a peculiarly solemn and imperative one when the subjects passed upon by Congress happen to involve , as in the present instance , the most momentous issues , to affect variously the various parts of a great country , and to have given rise in all quarters to such a conflict of opinion as to render it impossible to conjecture with any certainty on which side the majority really is . Surely if the pause for reflection intended by the wise authors of the Constitution by referring the subject back to Congress for reconsideration be ever expedient and necessary it is precisely such a case as the present . On the subject of distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands in the existing state of the finances it has been my duty to make known my settled convictions on various occasions during the present session of Congress . At the opening of the extra session , upward of twelve months ago , sharing fully in the general hope of returning prosperity and credit , I recommended such a distribution , but that recommendation was even then expressly coupled with the condition that the duties on imports should not exceed the rate of 20 per cent provided by the compromise act of 1833 . These hopes were not a little encouraged and these views strengthened by the report of Ewing , then Secretary of the Treasury , which was shortly thereafter laid before Congress , in which he recommended the imposition of duties at the rate of 20 per cent ad valorem on all free articles , with specified exceptions , and stated if this measure be adopted there will be received in the Treasury from customs in the last quarter of the present year 5 , 300 , 000 in all of the year 1842 , about 22 , 500 , 000 and in the year 1843 , after the final reduction under the act of March 2 , 1833 , about 20 , 800 , 000 and adds It is believed that after the heavy expenditures required by the public service in the present year shall have been provided for , the revenues which will accrue from that or a nearly approximate rate of duty will be sufficient to defray the expenses of the Government and leave a surplus to be annually applied to the gradual payment of the national debt , leaving the proceeds of the public lands to be disposed of as Congress shall see fit . I was most happy that Congress at the time seemed entirely to concur in the recommendations of the Executive , and , anticipating the correctness of the Secretary s conclusions , and in view of an actual surplus , passed the distribution act of the 4th September last , wisely limiting its operation by two conditions having reference , both of them , to a possible state of the Treasury different from that which had been anticipated by the Secretary of the Treasury and to the paramount necessities of the public service . It ordained that if at any time during the existence of that act there should be an imposition of duties on imports inconsistent with the provision of the act of the 2d March , 1833 , and beyond the rate of duties fixed by that act , to wit , 20 per cent on the value of such imports or any of them , then the distribution should be suspended , and should continue so suspended until that cause should be removed . By a previous clause it had , in a like spirit of wise and cautious patriotism , provided for another case , in which all are even now agreed , that the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should be used for the defense of the country . It was enacted that the act should continue and be in force until otherwise provided by law , unless the United States should become involved in war with any foreign power , in which event , from the commencement of hostilities , the act should be suspended until the cessation of hostilities . Not long after the opening of the present session of Congress the unprecedented and extraordinary difficulties that have recently embarrassed the finances of the country began to assume a serious aspect . It soon became quite evident that the hopes under which the act of 4th September was passed , and which alone justified it in the eyes either of Congress who imposed or of the Executive who approved , the first of the two conditions just recited were not destined to be fulfilled . Under the pressure , therefore , of the embarrassments which had thus unexpectedly arisen it appeared to me that the course to be pursued had been clearly marked out for the Government by that act itself . The condition contemplated in it as requiring a suspension of its operation had occurred . It became necessary in the opinions of all to raise the rate of duties upon imports above 20 per cent and with a view both to provide available means to meet present exigencies and to lay the foundation for a successful negotiation of a loan , I felt it incumbent on me to urge upon Congress to raise the duties accordingly , imposing them in a spirit of a wise discrimination for the twofold object of affording ample revenue for the Government and incidental protection to the various branches of domestic industry . I also pressed , in the most emphatic but respectful language I could employ , the necessity of making the land sales available to the Treasury , as the basis of public credit . I did not think that I could stand excused , much less justified , before the people of the United States , nor could I reconcile it to myself to recommend the imposition of additional taxes upon them without at the same time urging the employment of all the legitimate means of the Government toward satisfying its wants . These opinions were communicated in advance of any definitive action of Congress on the subject either of the tariff or land sales , under a high sense of public duty and in compliance with an express injunction of the Constitution , so that if a collision , extremely to be deprecated , as such collisions always are , has seemingly arisen between the executive and legislative branches of the Government , it has assuredly not been owing to any capricious interference or to any want of a plain and frank declaration of opinion on the part of the former . Congress differed in its views with those of the Executive , as it had undoubtedly a right to do , and passed a bill virtually for a time repealing the proviso of the act of the 4th September , 1841 . The bill was returned to the House in which it originated with my objections to its becoming a law . With a view to prevent , if possible , an open disagreement of opinion on a point so important , I took occasion to declare that I regarded it as an indispensable prerequisite to an increase of duties above 20 per cent that the act of the 4th September should remain unrepealed in its provisions . My reasons for that opinion were elaborately set forth in the message which accompanied the return of the bill , which no constitutional majority appears to have been found for passing into a law . The bill which is now before me proposes in its twenty seventh section the total repeal of one of the provisos in the act of September , and , while it increases the duties above 20 per cent , directs an unconditional distribution of the land proceeds . I am therefore subjected a second time in the period of a few days to the necessity of either giving my approval to a measure which , in my deliberate judgment , is in conflict with great public interests or of returning it to the House in which it originated with my objections . With all my anxiety for the passage of a law which would replenish an exhausted Treasury and furnish a sound and healthy encouragement to mechanical industry , I can not consent to do so at the sacrifice of the peace and harmony of the country and the clearest convictions of public duty . For some of the reasons which have brought me to this conclusion I refer to my previous messages to Congress , and briefly subjoin the following 1 . The bill unites two subjects which , so far from having any affinity to one another , are wholly incongruous in their character . It is both a revenue and an appropriation bill . It thus imposes on the Executive , in the first place , the necessity of either approving that which he would reject or rejecting that which he might otherwise approve . This is a species of constraint to which the judgment of the Executive ought not , in my opinion , to be subjected . But that is not my only objection to the act in its present form . The union of subjects wholly dissimilar in their character in the same bill , if it grew into a practice , would not fail to lead to consequences destructive of all wise and conscientious legislation . Various measures , each agreeable only to a small minority , might by being thus united and the more the greater chance of success lead to the passing of laws of which no single provision could if standing alone command a majority in its favor . 2 . While the Treasury is in a state of extreme embarrassment , requiring every dollar which it can make available , and when the Government has not only to lay additional taxes , but to borrow money to meet pressing demands , the bill proposes to give away a fruitful source of revenue which is the same thing as raising money by loan and taxation not to meet the wants of the Government , but for distribution a proceeding which I must regard as highly impolitic , if not unconstitutional . A brief review of the present condition of the public finances will serve to illustrate the true condition of the Treasury and exhibit its actual necessities On the 5th of August Friday last there was in the Treasury , in round numbers 2 , 150 , 000 Necessary to be retained to meet trust funds 360 , 000 Interest on public debt due in October 80 , 000 To redeem Treasury notes and pay the interest 100 , 000 Land distribution under the act of the 4th of September , 1841 640 , 000 1 , 180 , 000 Leaving an available amount of 970 , 000 The Navy Department had drawn requisitions on the Treasury at that time to meet debts actually due , among which are bills under protest for 1 , 414 , 000 , thus leaving an actual deficit of 444 , 000 . There was on hand about 100 , 000 of unissued Treasury notes , assisted by the accruing revenue amounting to about 150 , 000 per week , exclusive of receipts on unpaid bonds , to meet requisitions for the Army and the demands of the civil list . The withdrawal of the sum of 640 , 000 to be distributed among the States , so soon as the statements and accounts can be made up and completed , by virtue of the provisions of the act of the 4th of September last of which nearly a moiety goes to a few States , and only about 383 , 000 is to be divided among all the States , while it adds materially to the embarrassments of the Treasury , affords to the States no decided relief . No immediate relief from this state of things is anticipated unless what would most deeply be deplored the Government could be reconciled to the negotiation of loans already authorized by law at a rate of discount ruinous in itself and calculated most seriously to affect the public credit . So great is the depression of trade that even if the present bill were to become a law and prove to be productive some time would elapse before sufficient supplies would flow into the Treasury , while in the meantime its embarrassments would be continually augmented by the semiannual distribution of the land proceeds . Indeed , there is but too much ground to apprehend that even if this bill were permitted to become a law alienating , as it does , the proceeds of the land sales an actual deficit in the Treasury would occur , which would more than probably involve the necessity of a resort to direct taxation . Let it be also remarked that 5 , 500 , 000 of the public debt becomes redeemable in about two years and a half , which at any sacrifice must be met , while the Treasury is always liable to demands for the payment of outstanding Treasury notes . Such is the gloomy picture which our financial department now presents , and which calls for the exercise of a rigid economy in the public expenditures and the rendering available of all the means within the control of the Government . I most respectfully submit whether this is a time to give away the proceeds of the land sales when the public lands constitute a fund which of all others may be made most useful in sustaining the public credit . Can the Government be generous and munificent to others when every dollar it can command is necessary to supply its own wants And if Congress would not hesitate to suffer the provisions of the act of 4th September last to remain unrepealed in case the country was involved in war , is not the necessity for such a course now just as imperative as it would be then 3 . A third objection remains to be urged , which would be sufficient in itself to induce me to return the bill to the House with my objections . By uniting two subjects so incongruous as tariff and distribution it inevitably makes the fate of the one dependent upon that of the other in future contests of party . Can anything be more fatal to the merchant or manufacturer than such an alliance What they most of all require is a system of moderate duties so arranged as to withdraw the tariff question , as far as possible , completely from the arena of political contention . Their chief want is permanency and stability . Such an increase of the tariff I believe to be necessary in order to meet the economical expenditures of Government . Such an increase , made in the spirit of moderation and judicious discrimination , would , I have no doubt , be entirely satisfactory to the great majority of the American people . In the way of accomplishing a measure so salutary and so imperatively demanded by every public interest , the legislative department will meet with a cordial cooperation on the part of the Executive . This is all that the manufacturer can desire , and it would be a burden readily borne by the people . But I can not too earnestly repeat that in order to be beneficial it must be permanent , and in order to be permanent it must command general acquiescence . But can such permanency be justly hoped for if the tariff question be coupled with that of distribution , as to which a serious conflict of opinion exists among the States and the people , and which enlists in its support a bare majority , if , indeed , there be a majority , of the two Houses of Congress What permanency or stability can attach to a measure which , warring upon itself , gives away a fruitful source of revenue at the moment it proposes a large increase of taxes on the people Is the manufacturer prepared to stake himself and his interests upon such an issue I know that it is urged but most erroneously , in my opinion that instability is just as apt to be produced by retaining the public lands as a source of revenue as from any other cause , and this is ascribed to a constant fluctuation , as it is said , in the amount of sales . If there were anything in this objection , it equally applies to every imposition of duties on imports . The amount of revenue annually derived from duties is constantly liable to change . The regulations of foreign governments , the varying productiveness of other countries , periods of excitement in trade , and a great variety of other circumstances are constantly arising to affect the state of commerce , foreign and domestic , and , of consequence , the revenue levied upon it . The sales of the public domain in ordinary times are regulated by fixed laws which have their basis in a demand increasing only in the ratio of the increase of population . In recurring to the statistics connected with this subject it will be perceived that for a period of ten years preceding 1834 the average amount of land sales did not exceed 2 , 000 , 000 . For the increase which took place in 1834 , 1835 , and 1836 we are to look to that peculiar condition of the country which grew out of one of the most extraordinary excitements in business and speculation that has ever occurred in the history of commerce and currency . It was the fruit of a wild spirit of adventure engendered by a vicious system of credits , under the evils of which the country is still laboring , and which it is fondly hoped will not soon recur . Considering the vast amount of investments made by private individuals in the public lands during those three years , and which equaled 43 , 000 , 000 equal to more than twenty years purchase , taking the average of sales of the ten preceding years , it may be safely asserted that the result of the public land sales can hold out nothing to alarm the manufacturer with the idea of instability in the revenues and consequently in the course of the Government . Under what appears to me , therefore , the soundest considerations of public policy , and in view of the interests of every branch of domestic industry , I return you the bill with these my objections to its becoming a law . I take occasion emphatically to repeat my anxious desire to cooperate with Congress in the passing of a law which , while it shall assist in supplying the wants of the Treasury and reestablish public credit , shall afford to the manufacturing interests of the country all the incidental protection they require . After all , the effect of what I do is substantially to call on Congress to reconsider the subject . If on such reconsideration a majority of two thirds of both Houses should be in favor of this measure , it will become a law notwithstanding my objections . In a case of clear and manifest error on the part of the President the presumption of the Constitution is that such majorities will be found . Should they be so found in this case , having conscientiously discharged my own duty I shall cheerfully acquiesce in the result .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives of the United States It is with extreme regret that I feel myself constrained by the duty faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and to the best of my ability to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States to return to the House in which it originated the bill to provide for the better collection , safe keeping , and disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be styled the Fiscal Corporation of the United States , with my written objections . In my message sent to the Senate on the 16th day of August last , returning the bill to incorporate the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank of the United States , I distinctly declared that my own opinion had been uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise of the power of Congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the Union , and , entertaining that opinion , my main objection to that bill was based upon the highest moral and religious obligations of conscience and the Constitution . I readily admit that whilst the qualified veto with which the Chief Magistrate is invested should be regarded and was intended by the wise men who made it a part of the Constitution as a great conservative principle of our system , without the exercise of which on important occasions a mere representative majority might urge the Government in its legislation beyond the limits fixed by its framers or might exert its just powers too hastily or oppressively , yet it is a power which ought to be most cautiously exerted , and perhaps never except in a case eminently involving the public interest or one in which the oath of the President , acting under his convictions , both mental and moral , imperiously requires its exercise . In such a case he has no alternative . He must either exert the negative power intrusted to him by the Constitution chiefly for its own preservation , protection , and defense or commit an act of gross moral turpitude . Mere regard to the will of a majority must not in a constitutional republic like ours control this sacred and solemn duty of a sworn officer . The Constitution itself I regard and cherish as the embodied and written will of the whole people of the United States . It is their fixed and fundamental law , which they unanimously prescribe to the public functionaries , their mere trustees and servants . This their will and the law which they have given us as the rule of our action have no guard , no guaranty of preservation , protection , and defense , but the oaths which it prescribes to the public officers , the sanctity with which they shall religiously observe those oaths , and the patriotism with which the people shall shield it by their own sovereign will , which has made the Constitution supreme . It must be exerted against the will of a mere representative majority or not at all . It is alone in pursuance of that will that any measure can reach the President , and to say that because a majority in Congress have passed a bill he should therefore sanction it is to abrogate the power altogether and to render its insertion in the Constitution a work of absolute supererogation . The duty is to guard the fundamental will of the people themselves from in this case , I admit , unintentional change or infraction by a majority in Congress and in that light alone do I regard the constitutional duty which I now most reluctantly discharge . Is this bill now presented for my approval or disapproval such a bill as I have already declared could not receive my sanction Is it such a bill as calls for the exercise of the negative power under the Constitution Does it violate the Constitution by creating a national bank to operate per se over the Union Its title , in the first place , describes its general character . It is an act to provide for the better collection , safe keeping , and disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be styled the Fiscal Corporation of the United States . In style , then , it is plainly national in its character . Its powers , functions , and duties are those which pertain to the collecting , keeping , and disbursing the public revenue . The means by which these are to be exerted is a corporation to be styled the Fiscal Corporation of the United States . It is a corporation created by the Congress of the United States , in its character of a national legislature for the whole Union , to perform the fiscal purposes , meet the fiscal wants and exigencies , supply the fiscal uses , and exert the fiscal agencies of the Treasury of the United States . Such is its own description of itself . Do its provisions contradict its title They do not . It is true that by its first section it provides that it shall be established in the District of Columbia but the amount of its capital , the manner in which its stock is to be subscribed for and held , the persons and bodies , corporate and politic , by whom its stock may be held , the appointment of its directors and their powers and duties , its fundamental articles , especially that to establish agencies in any part of the Union , the corporate powers and business of such agencies , the prohibition of Congress to establish any other corporation with similar powers for twenty years , with express reservation in the same clause to modify or create any bank for the District of Columbia , so that the aggregate capital shall not exceed five millions , without enumerating other features which are equally distinctive and characteristic , clearly show that it can not be regarded as other than a bank of the United States , with powers seemingly more limited than have heretofore been granted to such an institution . It operates per se over the Union by virtue of the unaided and , in my view , assumed authority of Congress as a national legislature , as distinguishable from a bank created by Congress for the District of Columbia as the local legislature of the District . Every United States bank heretofore created has had power to deal in bills of exchange as well as local discounts . Both were trading privileges conferred , and both were exercised by virtue of the aforesaid power of Congress over the whole Union . The question of power remains unchanged without reference to the extent of privilege granted . If this proposed corporation is to be regarded as a local bank of the District of Columbia , invested by Congress with general powers to operate over the Union , it is obnoxious to still stronger objections . It assumes that Congress may invest a local institution with general or national powers . With the same propriety that it may do this in regard to a bank of the District of Columbia it may as to a State bank . Yet who can indulge the idea that this Government can rightfully , by making a State bank its fiscal agent , invest it with the absolute and unqualified powers conferred by this bill When I come to look at the details of the bill , they do not recommend it strongly to my adoption . A brief notice of some of its provisions will suffice . First . It may justify substantially a system of discounts of the most objectionable character . It is to deal in bills of exchange drawn in one State and payable in another without any restraint . The bill of exchange may have an unlimited time to run , and its renewability is nowhere guarded against . It may , in fact , assume the most objectionable form of accommodation paper . It is not required to rest on any actual , real , or substantial exchange basis . A drawer in one place becomes the accepter in another , and so in turn the accepter may become the drawer upon a mutual understanding . It may at the same time indulge in mere local discounts under the name of bills of exchange . A bill drawn at Philadelphia on Camden , J . , at New York on a border town in New Jersey , at Cincinnati on Newport , in Kentucky , not to multiply other examples , might , for anything in this bill to restrain it , become a mere matter of local accommodation . Cities thus relatively situated would possess advantages Over cities otherwise situated of so decided a character as most justly to excite dissatisfaction . Second . There is no limit prescribed to the premium in the purchase of bills of exchange , thereby correcting none of the evils under which the community now labors , and operating most injuriously upon the agricultural States , in which the irregularities in the rates of exchange are most severely felt . Nor are these the only consequences . A resumption of specie payments by the banks of those States would be liable to indefinite postponement for as the operation of the agencies of the interior would chiefly consist in selling bills of exchange , and the purchases could only be made in specie or the notes of banks paying specie , the State banks would either have to continue with their doors closed or exist at the mercy of this national monopoly of brokerage . Nor can it be passed over without remark that whilst the District of Columbia is made the seat of the principal bank , its citizens are excluded from all participation in any benefit it might afford by a positive prohibition on the bank from all discounting within the District . These are some of the objections which prominently exist against the details of the bill . Others might be urged of much force , but it would be unprofitable to dwell upon them . Suffice it to add that this charter is designed to continue for twenty years without a competitor that the defects to which I have alluded , being founded on the fundamental law of the corporation , are irrevocable , and that if the objections be well founded it would be over hazardous to pass the bill into a law . In conclusion I take leave most respectfully to say that I have felt the most anxious solicitude to meet the wishes of Congress in the adoption of a fiscal agent which , avoiding all constitutional objections , should harmonize conflicting opinions . Actuated by this feeling , I have been ready to yield much in a spirit of conciliation to the opinions of others and it is with great pain that I now feel compelled to differ from Congress a second time in the same session . At the commencement of this session , inclined from choice to defer to the legislative will , I submitted to Congress the propriety of adopting a fiscal agent which , without violating the Constitution , would separate the public money from the Executive control and perform the operations of the Treasury without being burdensome to the people or inconvenient or expensive to the Government . It is deeply to be regretted that this department of the Government can not upon constitutional and other grounds concur with the legislative department in this last measure proposed to attain these desirable objects . Owing to the brief space between the period of the death of my lamented predecessor and my own installation into office , I was , in fact , not left time to prepare and submit a definitive recommendation of my own in my regular message , and since my mind has been wholly occupied in a most anxious attempt to conform my action to the legislative will . In this communication I am confined by the Constitution to my objections simply to this bill , but the period of the regular session will soon arrive , when it will be my duty , under another clause of the Constitution , to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as I shall judge necessary and expedient . And I most respectfully submit , in a spirit of harmony , whether the present differences of opinion should be pressed further at this time , and whether the peculiarity of my situation does not entitle me to a postponement of this subject to a more auspicious period for deliberation . The two Houses of Congress have distinguished themselves at this extraordinary session by the performance of an immense mass of labor at a season very unfavorable both to health and action , and have passed many laws which I trust will prove highly beneficial to the interests of the country and fully answer its just expectations . It has been my good fortune and pleasure to concur with them in all measures except this . And why should our difference on this alone be pushed to extremes It is my anxious desire that it should not be . I too have been burdened with extraordinary labors of late , and I sincerely desire time for deep and deliberate reflection on this the greatest difficulty of my Administration . May we not now pause until a more favorable time , when , with the most anxious hope that the Executive and Congress may cordially unite , some measure of finance may be deliberately adopted promotive of the good of our common country I will take this occasion to declare that the conclusions to which I have brought myself are those of a settled conviction , founded , in my opinion , on a just view of the Constitution that in arriving at it I have been actuated by no other motive or desire than to uphold the institutions of the country as they have come down to us from the hands of our godlike ancestors , and that I shall esteem my efforts to sustain them , even though I perish , more honorable than to win the applause of men by a sacrifice of my duty and my conscience .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States We have continued reason to express our profound gratitude to the Great Creator of All Things for numberless benefits conferred upon us as a people . Blessed with genial seasons , the husbandman has his garners filled with abundance , and the necessaries of life , not to speak of its luxuries , abound in every direction . While in some other nations steady and industrious labor can hardly find the means of subsistence , the greatest evil which we have to encounter is a surplus of production beyond the home demand , which seeks , and with difficulty finds , a partial market in other regions . The health of the country , with partial exceptions , has for the past year been well preserved , and under their free and wise institutions the United States are rapidly advancing toward the consummation of the high destiny which an overruling Providence seems to have marked out for them . Exempt from domestic convulsion and at peace with all the world , we are left free to consult as to the best means of securing and advancing the happiness of the people . Such are the circumstances under which you now assemble in your respective chambers and which should lead us to unite in praise and thanksgiving to that great Being who made us and who preserves us as a nation . I congratulate you , fellow citizens , on the happy change in the aspect of our foreign affairs since my last annual message . Causes of complaint at that time existed between the United States and Great Britain which , attended by irritating circumstances , threatened most seriously the public peace . The difficulty of adjusting amicably the questions at issue between the two countries was in no small degree augmented by the lapse of time since they had their origin . The opinions entertained by the Executive on several of the leading topics in dispute were frankly set forth in the message at the opening of your late session . The appointment of a special minister by Great Britain to the United States with power to negotiate upon most of the points of difference indicated a desire on her part amicably to adjust them , and that minister was met by the Executive in the same spirit which had dictated his mission . The treaty consequent thereon having been duly ratified by the two Governments , a copy , together with the correspondence which accompanied it , is herewith communicated . I trust that whilst you may see in it nothing objectionable , it may be the means of preserving for an indefinite period the amicable relations happily existing between the two Governments . The question of peace or war between the United States and Great Britain is a question of the deepest interest , not only to themselves , but to the civilized world , since it is scarcely possible that a war could exist between them without endangering the peace of Christendom . The immediate effect of the treaty upon ourselves will be felt in the security afforded to mercantile enterprise , which , no longer apprehensive of interruption , adventures its speculations in the most distant seas , and , freighted with the diversified productions of every land , returns to bless our own . There is nothing in the treaty which in the slightest degree compromits the honor or dignity of either nation . Next to the settlement of the boundary line , which must always be a matter of difficulty between states as between individuals , the question which seemed to threaten the greatest embarrassment was that connected with the African slave trade . By the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it was expressly declared that Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice , and whereas both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition , it is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object . In the enforcement of the laws and treaty stipulations of Great Britain a practice had threatened to grow up on the part of its cruisers of subjecting to visitation ships sailing under the American flag , which , while it seriously involved our maritime rights , would subject to vexation a branch of our trade which was daily increasing , and which required the fostering care of Government . And although Lord Aberdeen in his correspondence with the American envoys at London expressly disclaimed all right to detain an American ship on the high seas , even if found with a cargo of slaves on board , and restricted the British pretension to a mere claim to visit and inquire , yet it could not well be discerned by the Executive of the United States how such visit and inquiry could be made without detention on the voyage and consequent interruption to the trade . It was regarded as the right of search presented only in a new form and expressed in different words , and I therefore felt it to be my duty distinctly to declare in my annual message to Congress that no such concession could be made , and that the United States had both the will and the ability to enforce their own laws and to protect their flag from being used for purposes wholly forbidden by those laws and obnoxious to the moral censure of the world . Taking the message as his letter of instructions , our then minister at Paris felt himself required to assume the same ground in a remonstrance which he felt it to be his duty to present to Guizot , and through him to the King of the French , against what has been called the quintuple treaty and his conduct in this respect met with the approval of this Government . In close conformity with these views the eighth article of the treaty was framed which provides that each nation shall keep afloat in the African seas a force not less than 80 guns , to act separately and apart , under instructions from their respective Governments , and for the enforcement of their respective laws and obligations . From this it will be seen that the ground assumed in the message has been fully maintained at the same time that the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent are to be carried out in good faith by the two countries , and that all pretense is removed for interference with our commerce for any purpose whatever by a foreign government . While , therefore , the United States have been standing up for the freedom of the seas , they have not thought proper to make that a pretext for avoiding a fulfillment of their treaty stipulations or a ground for giving countenance to a trade reprobated by our laws . A similar arrangement by the other great powers could not fail to sweep from the ocean the slave trade without the interpolation of any new principle into the maritime code . We may be permitted to hope that the example thus set will be followed by some if not all of them . We thereby also afford suitable protection to the fair trader in those seas , thus fulfilling at the same time the dictates of a sound policy and complying with the claims of justice and humanity . It would have furnished additional cause for congratulation if the treaty could have embraced all subjects calculated in future to lead to a misunderstanding between the two Governments . The Territory of the United States commonly called the Oregon Territory , lying on the Pacific Ocean north of the forty second degree of latitude , to a portion of which Great Britain lays claim , begins to attract the attention of our fellow citizens , and the tide of population which has reclaimed what was so lately an unbroken wilderness in more contiguous regions is preparing to flow over those vast districts which stretch from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean . In advance of the acquirement of individual rights to these lands , sound policy dictates that every effort should be resorted to by the two Governments to settle their respective claims . It became manifest at an early hour of the late negotiations that any attempt for the time being satisfactorily to determine those rights would lead to a protracted discussion , which might embrace in its failure other more pressing matters , and the Executive did not regard it as proper to waive all the advantages of an honorable adjustment of other difficulties of great magnitude and importance because this , not so immediately pressing , stood in the way . Although the difficulty referred to may not for several years to come involve the peace of the two countries , yet I shall not delay to urge on Great Britain the importance of its early settlement . Nor will other matters of commercial importance to the two countries be overlooked , and I have good reason to believe that it will comport with the policy of England , as it does with that of the United States , to seize upon this moment , when most of the causes of irritation have passed away , to cement the peace and amity of the two countries by wisely removing all grounds of probable future collision . With the other powers of Europe our relations continue on the most amicable footing . Treaties now existing with them should be rigidly observed , and every opportunity compatible with the interests of the United States should be seized upon to enlarge the basis of commercial intercourse . Peace with all the world is the true foundation of our policy , which can only be rendered permanent by the practice of equal and impartial justice to all . Our great desire should be to enter only into that rivalry which looks to the general good in the cultivation of the sciences , the enlargement of the field for the exercise of the mechanical arts , and the spread of commerce that great civilizer to every land and sea . Carefully abstaining from interference in all questions exclusively referring themselves to the political interests of Europe , we may be permitted to hope an equal exemption from the interference of European Governments in what relates to the States of the American continent . On the 23d of April last the commissioners on the part of the United States under the convention with the Mexican Republic of the 11th of April , 1839 , made to the proper Department a final report in relation to the proceedings of the commission . From this it appears that the total amount awarded to the claimants by the commissioners and the umpire appointed under that convention was 2 , 026 , 079 . 68 . The arbiter having considered that his functions were required by the convention to terminate at the same time with those of the commissioners , returned to the board , undecided for want of time , claims which had been allowed by the American commissioners to the amount of 928 , 620 . 88 . Other claims , in which the amount sought to be recovered was 3 , 336 , 837 . 05 , were submitted to the board too late for its consideration . The minister of the United States at Mexico has been duly authorized to make demand for payment of the awards according to the terms of the convention and the provisions of the act of Congress of the 12th of June , 1840 . He has also been instructed to communicate to that Government the expectations of the Government of the United States in relation to those claims which were not disposed of according to the provisions of the convention , and all others of citizens of the United States against the Mexican Government . He has also been furnished with other instructions , to be followed by him in case the Government of Mexico should not find itself in a condition to make present payment of the amount of the awards in specie or its equivalent . I am happy to be able to say that information which is esteemed favorable both to a just satisfaction of the awards and a reasonable provision for other claims has been recently received from Thompson , the minister of the United States , who has promptly and efficiently executed the instructions of his Government in regard to this important subject . The citizens of the United States who accompanied the late Texan expedition to Santa Fe , and who were wrongfully taken and held as prisoners of war in Mexico , have all been liberated . A correspondence has taken place between the Department of State and the Mexican minister of foreign affairs upon the complaint of Mexico that citizens of the United States were permitted to give aid to the inhabitants of Texas in the war existing between her and that Republic . Copies of this correspondence are herewith communicated to Congress , together with copies of letters on the same subject addressed to the diplomatic corps at Mexico by the American minister and the Mexican secretary of state . Mexico has thought proper to reciprocate the mission of the United States to that Government by accrediting to this a minister of the same rank as that of the representative of the United States in Mexico . From the circumstances connected with his mission favorable results are anticipated from it . It is so obviously for the interest of both countries as neighbors and friends that all just causes of mutual dissatisfaction should be removed that it is to be hoped neither will omit or delay the employment of any practicable and honorable means to accomplish that end . The affairs pending between this Government and several others of the States of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of Spain have again within the past year been materially obstructed by the military revolutions and conflicts in those countries . The ratifications of the treaty between the United States and the Republic of Ecuador of the 13th of June , 1839 , have been exchanged , and that instrument has been duly promulgated on the part of this Government . Copies are now communicated to Congress with a view to enable that body to make such changes in the laws applicable to our intercourse with that Republic as may be deemed requisite . Provision has been made by the Government of Chile for the payment of the claim on account of the illegal detention of the brig Warrior at Coquimbo in 1820 . This Government has reason to expect that other claims of our citizens against Chile will be hastened to a final and satisfactory close . The Empire of Brazil has not been altogether exempt from those convulsions which so constantly afflict the neighboring republics . Disturbances which recently broke out are , however , now understood to be quieted . But these occurrences , by threatening the stability of the governments , or by causing incessant and violent changes in them or in the persons who administer them , tend greatly to retard provisions for a just indemnity for losses and injuries suffered by individual subjects or citizens of other states . The Government of the United States will feel it to be its duty , however , to consent to no delay not unavoidable in making satisfaction for wrongs and injuries sustained by its own citizens . Many years having in some cases elapsed , a decisive and effectual course of proceeding will be demanded of the respective governments against whom claims have been preferred . The vexatious , harassing , and expensive war which so long prevailed with the Indian tribes inhabiting the peninsula of Florida has happily been terminated , whereby our Army has been relieved from a service of the most disagreeable character and the Treasury from a large expenditure . Some casual outbreaks may occur , such as are incident to the close proximity of border settlers and the Indians , but these , as in all other cases , may be left to the care of the local authorities , aided when occasion may require by the forces of the United States . A sufficient number of troops will be maintained in Florida so long as the remotest apprehensions of danger shall exist , yet their duties will be limited rather to the garrisoning of the necessary posts than to the maintenance of active hostilities . It is to be hoped that a territory so long retarded in its growth will now speedily recover from the evils incident to a protracted war , exhibiting in the increased amount of its rich productions true evidences of returning wealth and prosperity . By the practice of rigid justice toward the numerous Indian tribes residing within our territorial limits and the exercise of a parental vigilance over their interests , protecting them against fraud and intrusion , and at the same time using every proper expedient to introduce among them the arts of civilized life , we may fondly hope not only to wean them from their love of war , but to inspire them with a love for peace and all its avocations . With several of the tribes great progress in civilizing them has already been made . The schoolmaster and the missionary are found side by side , and the remnants of what were once numerous and powerful nations may yet be preserved as the builders up of a new name for themselves and their posterity . The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January , 1842 , exclusive of the amount deposited with the States , trust funds , and indemnities , was 230 , 483 . 68 . The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the present year from all sources amount to 26 , 616 , 593 . 78 , of which more than fourteen millions were received from customs and about one million from the public lands . The receipts for the fourth quarter are estimated at nearly eight millions , of which four millions are expected from customs and three millions and a half from loans and Treasury notes . The expenditures of the first three quarters of the present year exceed twenty six millions , and those estimated for the fourth quarter amount to about eight millions and it is anticipated there will be a deficiency of half a million on the 1st of January next , but that the amount of outstanding warrants estimated at 800 , 000 will leave an actual balance of about 224 , 000 in the Treasury . Among the expenditures of this year are more than eight millions for the public debt and about 600 , 000 on account of the distribution to the States of the proceeds of sales of the public lands . The present tariff of duties was somewhat hastily and hurriedly passed near the close of the late session of Congress . That it should have defects can therefore be surprising to no one . To remedy such defects as may be found to exist in any of its numerous provisions will not fail to claim your serious attention . It may well merit inquiry whether the exaction of all duties in cash does not call for the introduction of a system which has proved highly beneficial in countries where it has been adopted . I refer to the warehousing system . The first and most prominent effect which it would produce would be to protect the market alike against redundant or deficient supplies of foreign fabrics , both of which in the long run are injurious as well to the manufacturer as the importer . The quantity of goods in store being at all times readily known , it would enable the importer with an approach to accuracy to ascertain the actual wants of the market and to regulate himself accordingly . If , however , he should fall into error by importing an excess above the public wants , he could readily correct its evils by availing himself of the benefits and advantages of the system thus established . In the storehouse the goods imported would await the demand of the market and their issues would be governed by the fixed principles of demand and supply . Thus an approximation would be made to a steadiness and uniformity of price , which if attainable would conduce to the decided advantage of mercantile and mechanical operations . The apprehension may be well entertained that without something to ameliorate the rigor of cash payments the entire import trade may fall into the hands of a few wealthy capitalists in this country and in Europe . The small importer , who requires all the money he can raise for investments abroad , and who can but ill afford to pay the lowest duty , would have to subduct in advance a portion of his funds in order to pay the duties , and would lose the interest upon the amount thus paid for all the time the goods might remain unsold , which might absorb his profits . The rich capitalist , abroad as well as at home , would thus possess after a short time an almost exclusive monopoly of the import trade , and laws designed for the benefit of all would thus operate for the benefit of a few a result wholly uncongenial with the spirit of our institutions and antirepublican in all its tendencies . The warehousing system would enable the importer to watch the market and to select his own time for offering his goods for sale . A profitable portion of the carrying trade in articles entered for the benefit of drawback must also be most seriously affected without the adoption of some expedient to relieve the cash system . The warehousing system would afford that relief , since the carrier would have a safe recourse to the public storehouses and might without advancing the duty reship within some reasonable period to foreign ports . A further effect of the measure would be to supersede the system of drawbacks , thereby effectually protecting the Government against fraud , as the right of debenture would not attach to goods after their withdrawal from the public stores . In revising the existing tariff of duties , should you deem it proper to do so at your present session , I can only repeat the suggestions and recommendations which upon several occasions I have heretofore felt it to be my duty to offer to Congress . The great primary and controlling interest of the American people is union union not only in the mere forms of government , forms which may be broken , but union rounded in an attachment of States and individuals for each other . This union in sentiment and feeling can only be preserved by the adoption of that course of policy which , neither giving exclusive benefits to some nor imposing unnecessary burthens upon others , shall consult the interests of all by pursuing a course of moderation and thereby seeking to harmonize public opinion , and causing the people everywhere to feel and to know that the Government is careful of the interests of all alike . Nor is there any subject in regard to which moderation , connected with a wise discrimination , is more necessary than in the imposition of duties on imports . Whether reference be had to revenue , the primary object in the imposition of taxes , or to the incidents which necessarily flow from their imposition , this is entirely true . Extravagant duties defeat their end and object , not only by exciting in the public mind an hostility to the manufacturing interests , but by inducing a system of smuggling on an extensive scale and the practice of every manner of fraud upon the revenue , which the utmost vigilance of Government can not effectually suppress . An opposite course of policy would be attended by results essentially different , of which every interest of society , and none more than those of the manufacturer , would reap important advantages . Among the most striking of its benefits would be that derived from the general acquiescence of the country in its support and the consequent permanency and stability which would be given to all the operations of industry . It can not be too often repeated that no system of legislation can be wise which is fluctuating and uncertain . No interest can thrive under it . The prudent capitalist will never adventure his capital in manufacturing establishments , or in any other leading pursuit of life , if there exists a state of uncertainty as to whether the Government will repeal to morrow what it has enacted to day . Fitful profits , however high , if threatened with a ruinous reduction by a vacillating policy on the part of Government , will scarcely tempt him to trust the money which he has acquired by a life of labor upon the uncertain adventure . I therefore , in the spirit of conciliation , and influenced by no other desire than to rescue the great interests of the country from the vortex of political contention , and in the discharge of the high and solemn duties of the place which I now occupy , recommend moderate duties , imposed with a wise discrimination as to their several objects , as being not only most likely to be durable , but most advantageous to every interest of society . The report of the Secretary of the War Department exhibits a very full and satisfactory account of the various and important interests committed to the charge of that officer . It is particularly gratifying to find that the expenditures for the military service are greatly reduced in amount that a strict system of economy has been introduced into the service and the abuses of past years greatly reformed . The fortifications on our maritime frontier have been prosecuted with much vigor , and at many points our defenses are in a very considerable state of forwardness . The suggestions in reference to the establishment of means of communication with our territories on the Pacific and to the surveys so essential to a knowledge of the resources of the intermediate country are entitled to the most favorable consideration . While I would propose nothing inconsistent with friendly negotiations to settle the extent of our claims in that region , yet a prudent forecast points out the necessity of such measures as may enable us to maintain our rights . The arrangements made for preserving our neutral relations on the boundary between us and Texas and keeping in check the Indians in that quarter will be maintained so long as circumstances may require . For several years angry contentions have grown out of the disposition directed by law to be made of the mineral lands held by the Government in several of the States . The Government is constituted the landlord , and the Citizens of the States wherein lie the lands are its tenants . The relation is an unwise one , and it would be much more conducive of the public interest that a sale of the lands should be made than that they should remain in their present condition . The supply of the ore would be more abundantly and certainly furnished when to be drawn from the enterprise and the industry of the proprietor than under the present system . The recommendations of the Secretary in regard to the improvements of the Western waters and certain prominent harbors on the Lakes merit , and I doubt not will receive , your serious attention . The great importance of these subjects to the prosperity of the extensive region referred to and the security of the whole country in time of war can not escape observation . The losses of life and property which annually occur in the navigation of the Mississippi alone because of the dangerous obstructions in the river make a loud demand upon Congress for the adoption of efficient measures for their removal . The report of the Secretary of the Navy will bring you acquainted with that important branch of the public defenses . Considering the already vast and daily increasing commerce of the country , apart from the exposure to hostile inroad of an extended seaboard , all that relates to the Navy is calculated to excite particular attention . Whatever tends to add to its efficiency without entailing unnecessary charges upon the Treasury is well worthy of your serious consideration . It will be seen that while an appropriation exceeding by more than a million the appropriations of the current year is asked by the Secretary , yet that in this sum is proposed to be included 400 , 000 for the purchase of clothing , which when once expended will be annually reimbursed by the sale of the clothes , and will thus constitute a perpetual fund without any new appropriation to the same object . To this may also be added 50 , 000 asked to cover the arrearages of past years and 250 , 000 in order to maintain a competent squadron on the coast of Africa all of which when deducted will reduce the expenditures nearly within the limits of those of the current year . While , however , the expenditures will thus remain very nearly the same as of the antecedent year , it is proposed to add greatly to the operations of the marine , and in lieu of only 25 ships in commission and but little in the way of building , to keep with the same expenditure 41 vessels afloat and to build 12 ships of a small class . A strict system of accountability is established and great pains are taken to insure industry , fidelity , and economy in every department of duty . Experiments have been instituted to test the quality of various materials , particularly copper , iron , and coal , so as to prevent fraud and imposition . It will appear by the report of the Postmaster General that the great point which for several years has been so much desired has during the current year been fully accomplished . The expenditures of the Department for current service have been brought within its income without lessening its general usefulness . There has been an increase of revenue equal to 166 , 000 for the year 1842 over that of 1841 , without , as it is believed , any addition having been made to the number of letters and newspapers transmitted through the mails . The post office laws have been honestly administered , and fidelity has been observed in accounting for and paying over by the subordinates of the Department the moneys which have been received . For the details of the service I refer you to the report . I flatter myself that the exhibition thus made of the condition of the public administration will serve to convince you that every proper attention has been paid to the interests of the country by those who have been called to the heads of the different Departments . The reduction in the annual expenditures of the Government already accomplished furnishes a sure evidence that economy in the application of the public moneys is regarded as a paramount duty . At peace with all the world , the personal liberty of the citizen sacredly maintained and his rights secured under political institutions deriving all their authority from the direct sanction of the people , with a soil fertile almost beyond example and a country blessed with every diversity of climate and production , what remains to be done in order to advance the happiness and prosperity of such a people Under ordinary circumstances this inquiry could readily be answered . The best that probably could be done for a people inhabiting such a country would be to fortify their peace and security in the prosecution of their various pursuits by guarding them against invasion from without and violence from within . The rest for the greater part might be left to their own energy and enterprise . The chief embarrassments which at the moment exhibit themselves have arisen from overaction , and the most difficult task which remains to be accomplished is that of correcting and overcoming its effects . Between the years 1833 and 1838 additions were made to bank capital and bank issues , in the form of notes designed for circulation , to an extent enormously great . The question seemed to be not how the best currency could be provided , but in what manner the greatest amount of bank paper could be put in circulation . Thus a vast amount of what was called money since for the time being it answered the purposes of money was thrown upon the country , an overissue which was attended , as a necessary consequence , by an extravagant increase of the prices of all articles of property , the spread of a speculative mania all over the country , and has finally ended in a general indebtedness on the part of States and individuals , the prostration of public and private credit , a depreciation in the market value of real and personal estate , and has left large districts of country almost entirely without any circulating medium . In view of the fact that in 1830 the whole bank note circulation within the United States amounted to but 61 , 323 , 898 , according to the Treasury statements , and that an addition had been made thereto of the enormous sum of 88 , 000 , 000 in seven years the circulation on the 1st of January , 1837 , being stated at 149 , 185 , 890 , aided by the great facilities afforded in obtaining loans from European capitalists , who were seized with the same speculative mania which prevailed in the United States , and the large importations of funds from abroad the result of stock sales and loans no one can be surprised at the apparent but unsubstantial state of prosperity which everywhere prevailed over the land and as little cause of surprise should be felt at the present prostration of everything and the ruin which has befallen so many of our fellow citizens in the sudden withdrawal from circulation of so large an amount of bank issues since 1837 exceeding , as is believed , the amount added to the paper currency for a similar period antecedent to 1837 it ceases to be a matter of astonishment that such extensive shipwreck should have been made of private fortunes or that difficulties should exist in meeting their engagements on the part of the debtor States apart from which , if there be taken into account the immense losses sustained in the dishonor of numerous banks , it is less a matter of surprise that insolvency should have visited many of our fellow citizens than that so many should have escaped the blighting influences of the times . In the solemn conviction of these truths and with an ardent desire to meet the pressing necessities of the country , I felt it to be my duty to cause to be submitted to you at the commencement of your last session the plan of an exchequer , the whole power and duty of maintaining which in purity and vigor was to be exercised by the representatives of the people and the States , and therefore virtually by the people themselves . It was proposed to place it under the control and direction of a Treasury board to consist of three commissioners , whose duty it should be to see that the law of its creation was faithfully executed and that the great end of supplying a paper medium of exchange at all times convertible into gold and silver should be attained . The board thus constituted was given as much permanency as could be imparted to it without endangering the proper share of responsibility which should attach to all public agents . In order to insure all the advantages of a well matured experience , the commissioners were to hold their offices for the respective periods of two , four , and six years , thereby securing at all times in the management of the exchequer the services of two men of experience and to place them in a condition to exercise perfect independence of mind and action it was provided that their removal should only take place for actual incapacity or infidelity to the trust , and to be followed by the President with an exposition of the causes of such removal , should it occur . It was proposed to establish subordinate boards in each of the States , under the same restrictions and limitations of the power of removal , which , with the central board , should receive , safely keep , and disburse the public moneys . And in order to furnish a sound paper medium of exchange the exchequer should retain of the revenues of the Government a sum not to exceed 5 , 000 , 000 in specie , to be set apart as required by its operations , and to pay the public creditor at his own option either in specie or Treasury notes of denominations not less than 5 nor exceeding 100 , which notes should be redeemed at the several places of issue , and to be receivable at all times and everywhere in payment of Government dues , with a restraint upon such issue of bills that the same should not exceed the maximum of 15 , 000 , 000 . In order to guard against all the hazards incident to fluctuations in trade , the Secretary of the Treasury was invested with authority to issue 5 , 000 , 000 of Government stock , should the same at any time be regarded as necessary in order to place beyond hazard the prompt redemption of the bills which might be thrown into circulation thus in fact making the issue of 15 , 000 , 000 of exchequer bills rest substantially on 10 , 000 , 000 , and keeping in circulation never more than one and one half dollars for every dollar in specie . When to this it is added that the bills are not only everywhere receivable in Government dues , but that the Government itself would be bound for their ultimate redemption , no rational doubt can exist that the paper which the exchequer would furnish would readily enter into general circulation and be maintained at all times at or above par with gold and silver , thereby realizing the great want of the age and fulfilling the wishes of the people . In order to reimburse the Government the expenses of the plan , it was proposed to invest the exchequer with the limited authority to deal in bills of exchange unless prohibited by the State in which an agency might be situated having only thirty days to run and resting on a fair and bona fide basis . The legislative will on this point might be so plainly announced as to avoid all pretext for partiality or favoritism . It was furthermore proposed to invest this Treasury agent with authority to receive on deposit to a limited amount the specie funds of individuals and to grant certificates therefor to be redeemed on presentation , under the idea , which is believed to be well founded , that such certificates would come in aid of the exchequer bills in supplying a safe and ample paper circulation . Or if in place of the contemplated dealings in exchange the exchequer should be authorized not only to exchange its bills for actual deposits of specie , but , for specie or its equivalent , to sell drafts , charging therefor a small but reasonable premium , I can not doubt but that the benefits of the law would be speedily manifested in the revival of the credit , trade , and business of the whole country . Entertaining this opinion , it becomes my duty to urge its adoption upon Congress by reference to the strongest considerations of the public interests , with such alterations in its details as Congress may in its wisdom see fit to make . I am well aware that this proposed alteration and amendment of the laws establishing the Treasury Department has encountered various objections , and that among others it has been proclaimed a Government bank of fearful and dangerous import . It is proposed to confer upon it no extraordinary power . It purports to do no more than pay the debts of the Government with the redeemable paper of the Government , in which respect it accomplishes precisely what the Treasury does daily at this time in issuing to the public creditors the Treasury notes which under law it is authorized to issue . It has no resemblance to an ordinary bank , as it furnishes no profits to private stockholders and lends no capital to individuals . If it be objected to as a Government bank and the objection be available , then should all the laws in relation to the Treasury be repealed and the capacity of the Government to collect what is due to it or pay what it owes be abrogated . This is the chief purpose of the proposed exchequer , and surely if in the accomplishment of a purpose so essential it affords a sound circulating medium to the country and facilities to trade it should be regarded as no slight recommendation of it to public consideration . Properly guarded by the provisions of law , it can run into no dangerous evil , nor can any abuse arise under it but such as the Legislature itself will be answerable for if it be tolerated , since it is but the creature of the law and is susceptible at all times of modification , amendment , or repeal at the pleasure of Congress . I know that it has been objected that the system would be liable to be abused by the Legislature , by whom alone it could be abused , in the party conflicts of the day that such abuse would manifest itself in a change of the law which would authorize an excessive issue of paper for the purpose of inflating prices and winning popular favor . To that it may be answered that the ascription of such a motive to Congress is altogether gratuitous and inadmissible . The theory of our institutions would lead us to a different conclusion . But a perfect security against a proceeding so reckless would be found to exist in the very nature of things . The political party which should be so blind to the true interests of the country as to resort to such an expedient would inevitably meet with final overthrow in the fact that the moment the paper ceased to be convertible into specie or otherwise promptly redeemed it would become worthless , and would in the end dishonor the Government , involve the people in ruin and such political party in hopeless disgrace . At the same time , such a view involves the utter impossibility of furnishing any currency other than that of the precious metals for if the Government itself can not forego the temptation of excessive paper issues what reliance can be placed in corporations upon whom the temptations of individual aggrandizement would most strongly operate The people would have to blame none but themselves for any injury that might arise from a course so reckless , since their agents would be the wrongdoers and they the passive spectators . There can be but three kinds of public currency first , gold and silver second , the paper of State institutions or , third , a representative of the precious metals provided by the General Government or under its authority . The subtreasury system rejected the last in any form , and as it was believed that no reliance could be placed on the issues of local institutions for the purposes of general circulation it necessarily and unavoidably adopted specie as the exclusive currency for its own use and this must ever be the case unless one of the other kinds be used . The choice in the present state of public sentiment lies between an exclusive specie currency on the one hand and Government issues of some kind on the other . That these issues can not be made by a chartered institution is supposed to be conclusively settled . They must be made , then , directly by Government agents . For several years past they have been thus made in the form of Treasury notes , and have answered a valuable purpose . Their usefulness has been limited by their being transient and temporary their ceasing to bear interest at given periods necessarily causes their speedy return and thus restricts their range of circulation , and being used only in the disbursements of Government they can not reach those points where they are most required . By rendering their use permanent , to the moderate extent already mentioned , by offering no inducement for their return and by exchanging them for coin and other values , they will constitute to a certain extent the general currency so much needed to maintain the internal trade of the country . And this is the exchequer plan so far as it may operate in furnishing a currency . I can not forego the occasion to urge its importance to the credit of the Government in a financial point of view . The great necessity of resorting to every proper and becoming expedient in order to place the Treasury on a footing of the highest respectability is entirely obvious . The credit of the Government may be regarded as the very soul of the Government itself a principle of vitality without which all its movements are languid and all its operations embarrassed . In this spirit the Executive felt itself bound by the most imperative sense of duty to submit to Congress at its last session the propriety of making a specific pledge of the land fund as the basis for the negotiation of the loans authorized to be contracted . I then thought that such an application of the public domain would without doubt have placed at the command of the Government ample funds to relieve the Treasury from the temporary embarrassments under which it labored . American credit has suffered a considerable shock in Europe from the large indebtedness of the States and the temporary inability of some of them to meet the interest on their debts . The utter and disastrous prostration of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania had contributed largely to increase the sentiment of distrust by reason of the loss and ruin sustained by the holders of its stock , a large portion of whom were foreigners and many of whom were alike ignorant of our political organization and of our actual responsibilities . It was the anxious desire of the Executive that in the effort to negotiate the loan abroad the American negotiator might be able to point the money lender to the fund mortgaged for the redemption of the principal and interest of any loan he might contract , and thereby vindicate the Government from all suspicion of bad faith or inability to meet its engagements . Congress differed from the Executive in this view of the subject . It became , nevertheless , the duty of the Executive to resort to every expedient in its power to do so . After a failure in the American market a citizen of high character and talent was sent to Europe , with no better success and thus the mortifying spectacle has been presented of the inability of this Government to obtain a loan so small as not in the whole to amount to more than one fourth of its ordinary annual income , at a time when the Governments of Europe , although involved in debt and with their subjects heavily burthened with taxation , readily obtained loans of any amount at a greatly reduced rate of interest . It would be unprofitable to look further into this anomalous state of things , but I can not conclude without adding that for a Government which has paid off its debts of two wars with the largest maritime power of Europe , and now owing a debt which is almost next to nothing when compared with its boundless resources a Government the strongest in the world , because emanating from the popular will and firmly rooted in the affections of a great and free people , and whose fidelity to its engagements has never been questioned for such a Government to have tendered to the capitalists of other countries an opportunity for a small investment in its stock , and yet to have failed , implies either the most unfounded distrust in its good faith or a purpose to obtain which the course pursued is the most fatal which could have been adopted . It has now become obvious to all men that the Government must look to its own means for supplying its wants , and it is consoling to know that these means are altogether adequate for the object . The exchequer , if adopted , will greatly aid in bringing about this result . Upon what I regard as a well rounded supposition that its bills would be readily sought for by the public creditors and that the issue would in a short time reach the maximum of 15 , 000 , 000 , it is obvious that 10 , 000 , 000 would thereby be added to the available means of the Treasury without cost or charge . Nor can I fail to urge the great and beneficial effects which would be produced in aid of all the active pursuits of life . Its effects upon the solvent State banks , while it would force into liquidation those of an opposite character through its weekly settlements , would be highly beneficial and with the advantages of a sound currency the restoration of confidence and credit would follow with a numerous train of blessings . My convictions are most strong that these benefits would flow from the adoption of this measure but if the result should be adverse there is this security in connection with it that the law creating it may be repealed at the pleasure of the Legislature without the slightest implication of its good faith . I recommend to Congress to take into consideration the propriety of reimbursing a fine imposed on General Jackson at New Orleans at the time of the attack and defense of that city , and paid by him . Without designing any reflection on the judicial tribunal which imposed the fine , the remission at this day may be regarded as not unjust or inexpedient . The voice of the civil authority was heard amidst the glitter of arms and obeyed by those who held the sword , thereby giving additional luster to a memorable military achievement . If the laws were offended , their majesty was fully vindicated and although the penalty incurred and paid is worthy of little regard in a pecuniary point of view , it can hardly be doubted that it would be gratifying to the war worn veteran , now in retirement and in the winter of his days , to be relieved from the circumstances in which that judgment placed him . There are cases in which public functionaries may be called on to weigh the public interest against their own personal hazards , and if the civil law be violated from praiseworthy motives or an overruling sense of public danger and public necessity punishment may well be restrained within that limit which asserts and maintains the authority of the law and the subjection of the military to the civil power . The defense of New Orleans , while it saved a city from the hands of the enemy , placed the name of General Jackson among those of the greatest captains of the age and illustrated one of the brightest pages of our history . Now that the causes of excitement existing at the time have ceased to operate , it is believed that the remission of this fine and whatever of gratification that remission might cause the eminent man who incurred and paid it would be in accordance with the general feeling and wishes of the American people . I have thus , fellow citizens , acquitted myself of my duty under the Constitution by laying before you as succinctly as I have been able the state of the Union and by inviting your attention to measures of much importance to the country . The executive will most zealously unite its efforts with those of the legislative department in the accomplishment of all that is required to relieve the wants of a common constituency or elevate the destinies of a beloved country .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives I transmit herewith copies of dispatches received from our minister at Mexico since the commencement of your present session , which claim from their importance , and I doubt not will receive , your calm and deliberate consideration . The extraordinary and highly offensive language which the Mexican Government has thought proper to employ in reply to the remonstrance of the Executive , through Shannon , against the renewal of the war with Texas while the question of annexation was pending before Congress and the people , and also the proposed manner of conducting that war , will not fail to arrest your attention . Such remonstrance , urged in no unfriendly spirit to Mexico , was called for by considerations of an imperative character , having relation as well to the peace of this country and honor of this Government as to the cause of humanity and civilization . Texas had entered into the treaty of annexation upon the invitation of the Executive , and when for that act she was threatened with a renewal of the war on the part of Mexico she naturally looked to this Government to interpose its efforts to ward off the threatened blow . But one course was left the Executive , acting within the limits of its constitutional competency , and that was to pro , test in respectful , but at the same time strong and decided , terms against it . The war thus threatened to be renewed was promulgated by edicts and decrees , which ordered on the part of the Mexican military the desolation of whole tracts of country and the destruction without discrimination of all ages , sexes , and conditions of existence . Over the manner of conducting war Mexico possesses no exclusive control . She has no right to violate at pleasure the principles which an enlightened civilization has laid down for the conduct of nations at war , and thereby retrograde to a period of barbarism , which happily for the world has long since passed away . All nations are interested in enforcing an observance of those principles , and the United States , the oldest of the American Republics and the nearest of the civilized powers to the theater on which these enormities were proposed to be enacted , could not quietly content themselves to witness such a state of things . They had through the Executive on another occasion , and , as was believed , with the approbation of the whole country , remonstrated against outrages similar but even less inhuman than those which by her new edicts and decrees she has threatened to perpetrate , and of which the late inhuman massacre at Tabasco was but the precursor . The bloody and inhuman murder of Fannin and his companions , equaled only in savage barbarity by the usages of the untutored Indian tribes , proved how little confidence could be placed on the most solemn stipulations of her generals , while the fate of others who became her captives in war many of whom , no longer able to sustain the fatigues and privations of long journeys , were shot down by the wayside , while their companions who survived were subjected to sufferings even more painful than death had left an indelible stain on the page of civilization . The Executive , with the evidence of an intention on the part of Mexico to renew scenes so revolting to humanity , could do no less than renew remonstrances formerly urged . For fulfilling duties so imperative Mexico has thought proper , through her accredited organs , because she has had represented to her the inhumanity of such proceedings , to indulge in language unknown to the courtesy of diplomatic intercourse and offensive in the highest degree to this Government and people . Nor has she offended in this only . She has not only violated existing conventions between the two countries by arbitrary and unjust decrees against our trade and intercourse , but withholds installments of debt due to our citizens which she solemnly pledged herself to pay under circumstances which are fully explained by the accompanying letter from Green , our secretary of legation . And when our minister has invited the attention of her Government to wrongs committed by her local authorities , not only on the property but on the persons of our fellow citizens engaged in prosecuting fair and honest pursuits , she has added insult to injury by not even deigning for months together to return an answer to his representations . Still further to manifest her unfriendly feelings toward the United States , she has issued decrees expelling from some of her Provinces American citizens engaged in the peaceful pursuits of life , and now denies to those of our citizens prosecuting the whale fishery on the northwest coast of the Pacific the privilege , which has through all time heretofore been accorded to them , of exchanging goods of a small amount in value at her ports in California for supplies indispensable to their health and comfort . Nor will it escape the observation of Congress that in conducting a correspondence with a minister of the United States , who can not and does not know any distinction between the geographical sections of the Union , charges wholly unfounded are made against particular States , and an appeal to others for aid and protection against supposed wrongs . In this same connection , sectional prejudices are attempted to be excited and the hazardous and unpardonable effort is made to foment divisions amongst the States of the Union and thereby imbitter their peace . Mexico has still to learn that however freely we may indulge in discussion among ourselves , the American people will tolerate no interference in their domestic affairs by any foreign government , and in all that concerns the constitutional guaranties and the national honor the people of the United States have but one mind and one heart . The subject of annexation addresses itself , most fortunately , to every portion of the Union . The Executive would have been unmindful of its highest obligations if it could have adopted a course of policy dictated by sectional interests and local feelings . On the contrary , it was because the question was neither local nor sectional , but made its appeal to the interests of the whole Union , and of every State in the Union , that the negotiation , and finally the treaty of annexation , was entered into and it has afforded me no ordinary pleasure to perceive that so far as demonstrations have been made upon it by the people they have proceeded from all portions of the Union . Mexico may seek to excite divisions amongst us by uttering unjust denunciations against particular States , but when she comes to know that the invitations addressed to our fellow citizens by Spain , and afterwards by herself , to settle Texas were accepted by emigrants from all the States , and when , in addition to this , she refreshes her recollection with the fact that the first effort which was made to acquire Texas was during the Administration of a distinguished citizen from an Eastern State , which was afterwards renewed under the auspices of a President from the Southwest , she will awake to a knowledge of the futility of her present purpose of sowing dissensions among us or producing distraction in our councils by attach either on particular States or on persons who are now in the retirement of private life . Considering the appeal which she now makes to eminent citizens by name , can she hope to escape censure for having ascribed to them , as well as to others , a design , as she pretends now for the first time revealed , of having originated negotiations to despoil her by duplicity and falsehood of a portion of her territory The opinion then , as now , prevailed with the Executive that the annexation of Texas to the Union was a matter of vast importance in order to acquire that territory before it had assumed a position among the independent powers of the earth , propositions were made to Mexico for a cession of it to the United States . Mexico saw in these proceedings at the time no cause of complaint . She is now , when simply reminded of them , awakened to the knowledge of the fact , which she , through her secretary of state , promulgates to the whole world as true , that those negotiations were founded in deception and falsehood and superinduced by unjust and iniquitous motives . While Texas was a dependency of Mexico the United States opened negotiations with the latter power for the cession of her then acknowledged territory , and now that Texas is independent of Mexico and has maintained a separate existence for nine years , during which time she has been received into the family of nations and is represented by accredited ambassadors at many of the principal Courts of Europe , and when it has become obvious to the whole world that she is forever lost to Mexico , the United States is charged with deception and falsehood in all relating to the past , and condemnatory accusations are made against States which have had no special agency in the matter , because the Executive of the whole Union has negotiated with free and independent Texas upon a matter vitally important to the interests of both countries and after nine years of unavailing war Mexico now announces her intention , through her secretary of foreign affairs , never to consent to the independence of Texas or to abandon the effort to reconquer that Republic . She thus announces a perpetual claim , which at the end of a century will furnish her as plausible a ground for discontent against any nation which at the end of that time may enter into a treaty with Texas as she possesses at this moment against the United States . The lapse of time can add nothing to her title to independence . A course of conduct such as has been described on the part of Mexico , in violation of all friendly feeling and of the courtesy which should characterize the intercourse between the nations of the earth , might well justify the United States in a resort to any measures to vindicate their national honor but , actuated by a sincere desire to preserve the general peace , and in view of the present condition of Mexico , the Executive , resting upon its integrity , and not fearing but that the judgment of the world will duly appreciate its motives , abstains from recommending to Congress a resort to measures of redress and contents itself with reurging upon that body prompt and immediate action on the subject of annexation . By adopting that measure the United States will be in the exercise of an undoubted right and if Mexico , not regarding their forbearance , shall aggravate the injustice of her conduct by a declaration of war against them , upon her head will rest all the responsibility .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I have the satisfaction to communicate to the Senate the results of the negotiations recently had in this city with the British minister , special and extraordinary . These results comprise First . A treaty to settle and define the boundaries between the territories of the United States and the possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America , for the suppression of the African slave trade , and the surrender of criminals fugitive from justice in certain cases . Second . A correspondence on the subject of the interference of the colonial authorities of the British West Indies with American merchant vessels driven by stress of weather or carried by violence into the ports of those colonies . Third . A correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction of the steamboat Caroline . Fourth . A correspondence on the subject of impressment . If this treaty shall receive the approbation of the Senate , it will terminate a difference respecting boundary which has long subsisted between the two Governments , has been the subject of several ineffectual attempts at settlement , and has sometimes led to great irritation , not without danger of disturbing the existing peace . Both the United States and the States more immediately concerned have entertained no doubt of the validity of the American title to all the territory which has been in dispute , but that title was controverted and the Government of the United States had agreed to make the dispute a subject of arbitration . One arbitration had been actually had , but had failed to settle the controversy , and it was found at the commencement of last year that a correspondence had been in progress between the two Governments for a joint commission , with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator with authority to make a final decision . That correspondence , however , had been retarded by various occurrences , and had come to no definite result when the special mission of Lord Ashburton was announced . This movement on the part of England afforded in the judgment of the Executive a favorable opportunity for making an attempt to settle this long existing controversy by some agreement or treaty without further reference to arbitration . It seemed entirely proper that if this purpose were entertained consultation should be had with the authorities of the States of Maine and Massachusetts . Letters , therefore , of which copies are herewith communicated , were addressed to the governors of those States , suggesting that commissioners should be appointed by each of them , respectively , to repair to this city and confer with the authorities of this Government on a line by agreement or compromise , with its equivalents and compensations . This suggestion was met by both States in a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly complied with . Four commissioners on the part of Maine and three on the part of Massachusetts , all persons of distinction and high character , were duly appointed and commissioned and lost no time in presenting themselves at the seat of the Government of the United States . These commissioners have been in correspondence with this Government during the period of the discussions have enjoyed its confidence and freest communications have aided the general object with their counsel and advice , and in the end have unanimously signified their assent to the line proposed in the treaty . Ordinarily it would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such a variety of interests in a matter in itself difficult and perplexed , but the efforts of the Government in attempting to accomplish this desirable object have been seconded and sustained by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the part of the States concerned , to which much of the success of these efforts is to be ascribed . Connected with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary , so far as it respects the States of Maine and Massachusetts , is the continuation of that line along the highlands to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River . Which of the sources of that stream is entitled to this character has been matter of controversy and of some interest to the State of New Hampshire . The King of the Netherlands decided the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut . This did not satisfy the claim of New Hampshire . The line agreed to in the present treaty follows the highlands to the head of Halls Stream and thence down that river , embracing the whole claim of New Hampshire and establishing her title to 100 , 000 acres of territory more than she would have had by the decision of the King of the Netherlands . By the treaty of 1783 the line is to proceed down the Connecticut River to the forty fifth degree of north latitude , and thence west by that parallel till it strikes the Lawrence . Recent examinations having ascertained that the line heretofore received as the true line of latitude between those points was erroneous , and that the correction of this error would not only leave on the British side a considerable tract of territory heretofore supposed to belong to the States of Vermont and New York , but also Rouses Point , the site of a military work of the United States , it has been regarded as an object of importance not only to establish the rights and jurisdiction of those States up to the line to which they have been considered to extend , but also to comprehend Rouses Point within the territory of the United States . The relinquishment by the British Government of all the territory south of the line heretofore considered to be the true line has been obtained , and the consideration for this relinquishment is to inure by the provisions of the treaty to the States of Maine and Massachusetts . The line of boundary , then , from the source of the Croix to the Lawrence , so far as Maine and Massachusetts are concerned , is fixed by their own consent and for considerations satisfactory to them , the chief of these considerations being the privilege of transporting the lumber and agricultural products grown and raised in Maine on the waters of the Johns and its tributaries down that river to the ocean free from imposition or disability . The importance of this privilege , perpetual in its terms , to a country covered at present by pine forests of great value , and much of it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement , is not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent men is likely to be divided . So far as New Hampshire is concerned , the treaty secures all that she requires , and New York and Vermont are quieted to the extent of their claim and occupation . The difference which would be made in the northern boundary of these two States by correcting the parallel of latitude may be seen on Tanner s maps 1836 , new atlas , maps Nos . 6 and 9 . From the intersection of the forty fifth degree of north latitude with the Lawrence and along that river and the lakes to the water communication between Lake Huron and Lake Superior the line was definitively agreed on by the commissioners of the two Governments under the sixth article of the treaty of Ghent but between this last mentioned point and the Lake of the Woods the commissioners acting under the seventh article of that treaty found several matters of disagreement , and therefore made no joint report to their respective Governments . The first of these was Sugar Island , or Georges Island , lying in Marys River , or the water communication between Lakes Huron and Superior . By the present treaty this island is embraced in the territories of the United States . Both from soil and position it is regarded as of much value . Another matter of difference was the manner of extending the line from the point at which the commissioners arrived , north of Isle Royale , in Lake Superior , to the Lake of the Woods . The British commissioner insisted on proceeding to Fond du Lac , at the southwest angle of the lake , and thence by the river Louis to the Rainy Lake . The American commissioner supposed the true course to be to proceed by way of the Dog River . Attempts were made to compromise this difference , but without success . The details of these proceedings are found at length in the printed separate reports of the commissioners . From the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of the treaty of peace , some of the descriptions in that treaty do not harmonize with its natural features as now ascertained . Long Lake is nowhere to be found under that name . There is reason for supposing , however , that the sheet of water intended by that name is the estuary at the mouth of Pigeon River . The present treaty therefore adopts that estuary and river , and afterwards pursues the usual route across the height of land by the various portages and small lakes till the line reaches Rainy Lake , from which the commissioners agreed on the extension of it to its termination in the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods . The region of country on and near the shore of the lake between Pigeon River on the north and Fond du Lac and the river Louis on the south and west , considered valuable as a mineral region , is thus included within the United States . It embraces a territory of 4 , 000 , 000 acres northward of the claim set up by the British commissioner under the treaty of Ghent . From the height of land at the head of Pigeon River westerly to the Rainy Lake the country is understood to be of little value , being described by surveyors and marked on the map as a region of rock and water . From the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods , which is found to be in latitude 45 1087 1111 1029 23 55 north , existing treaties require the line to be run due south to its intersection with the forty fifth parallel , and thence along that parallel to the Rocky Mountains . After sundry informal communications with the British minister upon the subject of the claims of the two countries to territory west of the Rocky Mountains , so little probability was found to exist of coming to any agreement on that subject at present that it was not thought expedient to make it one of the subjects of formal negotiation to be entered upon between this Government and the British minister as part of his duties under his special mission . By the treaty of 1783 the line of division along the rivers and lakes from the place where the forty fifth parallel of north latitude strikes the Lawrence to the outlet of Lake Superior is invariably to be drawn through the middle of such waters , and not through the middle of their main channels . Such a line , if extended according to the literal terms of the treaty , would , it is obvious , occasionally intersect islands . The manner in which the commissioners of the two Governments dealt with this difficult subject may be seen in their reports . But where the line thus following the middle of the river or water course did not meet with islands , yet it was liable sometimes to leave the only practicable navigable channel altogether on one side . The treaty made no provision for the common use of the waters by the citizens and subjects of both countries . It has happened , therefore , in a few instances that the use of the river in particular places would be greatly diminished to one party or the other if in fact there was not a choice in the use of channels and passages . Thus at the Long Sault , in the Lawrence a dangerous passage , practicable only for boats the only safe run is between the Long Sault Islands and Barnharts Island all which belong to the United States on one side and the American shore on the other . On the other hand , by far the best passage for vessels of any depth of water from Lake Erie into the Detroit River is between Bois Blanc , a British island , and the Canadian shore . So again , there are several channels or passages , of different degrees of facility and usefulness , between the several islands in the river Clair at or near its entry into the lake of that name . In these three cases the treaty provides that all the several passages and channels shall be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both parties . The treaty obligations subsisting between the two countries for the suppression of the African slave trade and the complaints made to this Government within the last three or four years , many of them but too well founded , of the visitation , seizure , and detention of American vessels on that coast by British cruisers could not but form a delicate and highly important part of the negotiations which have now been held . The early and prominent part which the Government of the United States has taken for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic is well known . By the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it is declared that the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice , and that both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition and it is thereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object . The Government of the United States has by law declared the African slave trade piracy , and at its suggestion other nations have made similar enactments . It has not been wanting in honest and zealous efforts , made in conformity with the wishes of the whole country , to accomplish the entire abolition of the traffic in slaves upon the African coast , but these efforts and those of other countries directed to the same end have proved to a considerable degree unsuccessful . Treaties are known to have been entered into some years ago between England and France by which the former power , which usually maintains a large naval force on the African station , was authorized to seize and bring in for adjudication vessels found engaged in the slave trade under the French flag . It is known that in December last a treaty was signed in London by the representatives of England , France , Russia , Prussia , and Austria having for its professed object a strong and united effort of the five powers to put an end to the traffic . This treaty was not officially communicated to the Government of the United States , but its provisions and stipulations are supposed to be accurately known to the public . It is understood to be not yet ratified on the part of France . No application or request has been made to this Government to become party to this treaty , but the course it might take in regard to it has exalted no small degree of attention and discussion in Europe , as the principle upon which it is founded and the stipulations which it contains have caused warm animadversions and great political excitement . In my message at the commencement of the present session of Congress I endeavored to state the principles which this Government supports respecting the right of search and the immunity of flags . Desirous of maintaining those principles fully , at the same time that existing obligations should be fulfilled , I have thought it most consistent with the honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its own laws and perform its own obligations by its own means and its own power . The examination or visitation of the merchant vessels of one nation by the cruisers of another for any purpose except those known and acknowledged by the law of nations , under whatever restraints or regulations it may take place , may lead to dangerous results . It is far better by other means to supersede any supposed necessity or any motive for such examination or visit . Interference with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding , apt to touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interests of individuals . It has been thought , therefore , expedient , not only in accordance with the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent , but at the same time as removing all pretext on the part of others for violating the immunities of the American flag upon the seas , as they exist and are defined by the law of nations , to enter into the articles now submitted to the Senate . The treaty which I now submit to you proposes no alteration , mitigation , or , modification of the rules of the law of nations . It provides simply that each of the two Governments shall maintain on the coast of Africa a sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the laws , rights , and obligations of the two countries for the suppression of the slave trade . Another consideration of great importance has recommended this mode of fulfilling the duties and obligations of the country . Our commerce along the western coast of Africa is extensive , and supposed to be increasing . There is reason to think that in many cases those engaged in it have met with interruptions and annoyances caused by the jealousy and instigation of rivals engaged in the same trade . Many complaints on this subject have reached the Government . A respectable naval force on the coast is the natural resort and security against further occurrences of this kind . The surrender to justice of persons who , having committed high crimes , seek an asylum in the territories of a neighboring nation would seem to be an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belonging to the present state of civilization and intercourse . The British Provinces of North America are separated from the States of the Union by a line of several thousand miles , and along portions of this line the amount of population on either side is quite considerable , while the passage of the boundary is always easy . Offenders against the law on the one side transfer themselves to the other . Sometimes , with great difficulty , they are brought to justice , but very often they wholly escape . A consciousness of immunity from the power of avoiding justice in this way instigates the unprincipled and reckless to the commission of offenses , and the peace and good neighborhood of the border are consequently often disturbed . In the case of offenders fleeing from Canada into the United States , the governors of States are often applied to for their surrender , and questions of a very embarrassing nature arise from these applications . It has been thought highly important , therefore , to provide for the whole case by a proper treaty stipulation . The article on the subject in the proposed treaty is carefully confined to such offenses as all mankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of life and property . In this careful and specific enumeration of crimes the object has been to exclude all political offenses or criminal charges arising from wars or intestine commotions . Treason , misprision of treason , libels , desertion from military service , and other offenses of similar character are excluded . And lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise from the stipulation rendering its continuance in the opinion of one or both of the parties not longer desirable , it is left in the power of either to put an end to it at will . The destruction of the steamboat Caroline at Schlosser four or five years ago occasioned no small degree of excitement at the time , and became the subject of correspondence between the two Governments . That correspondence , having been suspended for a considerable period , was renewed in the spring of the last year , but no satisfactory result having been arrived at , it was thought proper , though the occurrence had ceased to be fresh and recent , not to omit attention to it on the present occasion . It has only been so far discussed in the correspondence now submitted as it was accomplished by a violation of the territory of the United States . The letter of the British minister , while he attempts to justify that violation upon the ground of a pressing and overruling necessity , admitting , nevertheless , that even if justifiable an apology was due for it , and accompanying this acknowledgment with assurances of the sacred regard of his Government for the inviolability of national territory , has seemed to me sufficient to warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what took place as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country . On the subject of the interference of the British authorities in the West Indies , a confident hope is entertained that the correspondence which has taken place , showing the grounds taken by this Government and the engagements entered into by the British minister , will be found such as to satisfy the just expectation of the people of the United States . The impressment of seamen from merchant vessels of this country by British cruisers , although not practiced in time of peace , and therefore not at present a productive cause of difference and irritation , has , nevertheless , hitherto been so prominent a topic of controversy and is so likely to bring on renewed contentions at the first breaking out of a European war that it has been thought the part of wisdom now to take it into serious and earnest consideration . The letter from the Secretary of State to the British minister explains the ground which the Government has assumed and the principles which it means to uphold . For the defense of these grounds and the maintenance of these principles the most perfect reliance is placed on the intelligence of the American people and on their firmness and patriotism in whatever touches the honor of the country or its great and essential interests . JOHN TYLER . The following are inserted because they pertain to the treaty transmitted with the message of President Tyler immediately preceding . DEPARTMENT OF STATWashington , August 3 , 1848 . To the Senate of the United States The Secretary of State has the honor to transmit to the Senate , in compliance with a resolution adopted by it on the 29th ultimo , a copy of the joint report of the commissioners under the treaty of Washington of August 9 , 1842 , together with a copy of the report of the American commissioner transmitting the same to the State Department . JAMES BUCHANAN . Smith to Buchanan . WASHINGTOApril 20 , 1848 . SIIn presenting to you the joint report of the commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9 , 1842 , to survey and mark the line of boundary between the United States and the British Provinces , which I have the honor herewith most respectfully to submit , I have to perform the painful duty of informing you that the maps of that line and of the adjacent country , which had been elaborately constructed by the scientific corps on the part of the United States , and contained upon 100 sheets of drawing paper of the largest size , together with the tables of the survey , have been destroyed by the conflagration of the building in which they were contained . This house had been occupied by Major James Graham , the head of the scientific corps and principal astronomer of the American commission , as his office until his departure for Mexico . All the maps , drawings , and tables had been completed and duly authenticated by the joint commissioners , and were ready to be deposited with their joint report under their hands and seals in the archives of this Government . Of this I had the honor to inform you in my letter of the 24th ultimo . I can hardly express the pain which this unfortunate event has occasioned me . But I can not perceive that any imputation of blame can properly be attached to any officer of the commission . The care and custody of all the work of the United States scientific corps were properly placed in charge of Major Graham , as the head of that corps , who had had the immediate direction and superintendence of it from the first organization of the commission . He required the maps and tables at his office for reference and revision in the progress of the astronomical work . Upon his departure for Mexico he placed Lieutenant Whipple in his rooms with an injunction to guard with the utmost care the valuable property of the commission . On the day after he left the city , and when for the first time informed of the fact , I called upon Lieutenant Whipple and requested him to have all the maps , drawings , and tables ready to be turned over to the State Department on the following day . On the 24th ultimo I acquainted you with that fact . No censure can possibly be attributed to Lieutenant Whipple , whose great care and attention to all his duties have been on all occasions highly distinguished . He escaped from the fire with scarcely an article of his dress , and his loss in money and clothing is at least 1 , 000 . Major Graham has lost his valuable library , together with personal effects to a large amount . The fire was communicated from the basement of the house , and by no effort could anything be saved . There are tracings of the maps upon tissue paper , without the topography , in the State of Maine , but they are not signed by the commissioners . The field books of the engineers were , fortunately , not in Major Graham s office , and are preserved . Duplicates of the maps , duly authenticated , have been placed in the British archives at London , which , although they have not the topography of the country so fully laid down upon them as it was upon our own , represent with equal exactness the survey of the boundary itself . Should it be deemed expedient by this Government to procure copies of them , access to those archives for that purpose would undoubtedly be permitted , and the object accomplished at small expense , and when completed these copies could be authenticated by the joint commissioners in accordance with the provisions of the treaty . I have the honor to be , with great respect , your obedient and humble servant , ALBERT SMITH . Report of the Joint commission of boundary appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9 , 1842 . The undersigned , commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington to trace and mark the boundary , as directed by that treaty , between the British possessions in North America and the United States that is to say , James Buckhall Estcourt , lieutenant colonel in the British army , appointed commissioner by Her Britannic Majesty , and Albert Smith , appointed commissioner by the President of the United States having accomplished the duty assigned to them , do now , in accordance with the directions of the said treaty , submit the following report and the accompanying maps , jointly signed , to their respective Governments . In obedience to the terms of the treaty , the undersigned met at Bangor , in the State of Maine , on the 1st day of May , 1843 , where they produced and verified the authority under which they each were respectively to act . They then adjourned , because the weather was not sufficiently open for taking the field , to the 1st of the following month June , and agreed to meet again at that time at Houlton . Accordingly , they did meet at that place , and began their operations . It may be desirable to state at the outset that for the sake of convenience the whole line of boundary marked by the undersigned has been divided in the mention made of the different portions into the following grand divisions , viz North line , from the source of the Croix to the intersection of the John . River John , from the intersection of the north line to the mouth of the Francis . River Francis , from its mouth to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook . Southwest line , from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook to the Northwest Branch of the John . South line , from the Northwest Branch to the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 on the Southwest Branch . Southwest Branch , from the parallel 46 1087 1111 1029 25 to its source . Highlands , from the source of the Southwest Branch of the John to the source of Halls Stream . Halls Streams from its source to the intersection of the line of Valentine and Collins . West line , from Halls Stream to the Lawrence near Regis , along the line of Valentine and Collins . To return to the narration of operations The exploring line of Colonel Bouchette and Johnson , as directed by the treaty , was traced from the monument at the source of the Croix to the intersection of the John . The monument found at the source of the Croix , as described in the report of Colonel Bouchette and Johnson , and the course of their exploring line , was traced by blazes or marks upon the trees . An old line , cut out by the assistant surveyors of Colonel Bouchette and Johnson , was also found , which terminated about half a mile north of the South Branch of the Meduxnikeag , where , by records to which the undersigned referred , they ascertained that it had been abandoned because of its deviation from the exploring fine of Colonel Bouchette and Johnson . After the exploration and remarking of the north line it was cut out 30 feet wide . The same was afterwards done in all parts where the boundary passed through woodland . After thus opening the north line it was surveyed , and iron posts were erected at intervals to mark it . The general bearing of the line was rather to the west of the meridian of the monument at the source of the Croix . The precise line laid down by the undersigned was determined by successive courses , of which each was made to be as long as was convenient , provided it did not pass out of the opening of 30 feet . At each angle of deflection an iron monument was erected , and placed anglewise with the line . Other monuments were erected at the crossing of roads , rivers , and at every mile , commencing from the source of the Croix . Those which were not intended to mark angles of deflection were placed square with the line . At the intersection of the John by the north line the river is deep and broad . The boundary rims up the middle of the channel of the river , as indicated by the maps , dividing the islands as follows No . 1 . Ryan s Island United States . No . 2 . King s Island United States . No . 3 . Les Trois Isles United States . No . 4 . La Septieme Isle United States . No . 5 . Quissibis Great Britain . No . 6 . La Grand Isle United States . No . 7 . Thibideau s Islands United States . No . 8 . Madawaska lslands Great Britain . No . 9 . Joseph Michaud s three islands United States . No . 10 . Pine Island Great Britain . No . 11 . Baker s Turtle Dagle s islands Great Britain Fourth Fifth No . 12 . Kennedy s Island Great Britain . No . 13 . Crock s Cranberry islands Great Britain . Gooseberry No . 14 . Savage s Island United States . No . 15 . Wheelock s Island United States . No . 16 . Caton s Island United States . No . 17 . Honeywell s Island United States . No . 18 . Savage and Johnson s Island United States . No . 19 . Grew s Island United States . No . 20 . Kendall s Island Great Britain . The islands were distributed to Great Britain or to the United States , as they were found to be on the fight or left of the deep channel . There was but one doubtful case , La Septieme Isle , and that was apportioned to the United States because the majority of the owners were ascertained to reside on the United States side of the river . Monuments were erected upon the islands , marking them for Great Britain or the United States , as the case may have been . After leaving the John the boundary enters the Francis , dividing the islands at the mouth of that river in the manner shown in the maps . It then runs up the Francis , through the middle of the lakes upon it , to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook , the third large lake from the mouth of the river . At the outlet a large monument has been erected . In order to determine the point on the Northwest Branch to which the treaty directed that a straight line should be run from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook , a survey of that stream was made , and also of the main John in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Northwest Branch , and a line was cut between the John and the point on the Northwest Branch ascertained by the survey to be miles in the nearest direction from it , and the distance was afterwards verified by chaining . It was ascertained also , in accordance with the provisions of the treaty , by a triangulation of the country toward the highlands dividing the waters of the Lawrence and of the John , that more than 7 miles intervened between the point selected on the Northwest Branch and the crest of the dividing ridge . A large iron monument was afterwards erected on the point thus selected , and the space around was cleared and sown with grass seed . It is a short distance below the outlet of Lake Ishaganalshegeck . The outlet of Lake Pohenagamook and the point on the Northwest Branch designated by the treaty having been thus ascertained and marked , in the spring of 1844 a straight line was run between them . Along that line , which passes entirely through forest , monuments were erected at every mile , at the crossings of the principal streams and rivers , and at the tops of those hills where a transit instrument had been set up to test the straightness of the line . As soon as the parallel of latitude 46 1087 1111 1029 25 had been determined on the Southwest Branch , in the early part of the summer of 1844 , a straight line was drawn from the boundary point on the Northwest Branch to a large monument erected on the left bank of the Southwest Branch where it is intersected by the parallel of latitude 46 1087 1111 1029 25 The line so drawn crosses the Southwest Branch once before it reaches the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 , and at about half a mile distance from that parallel . There also a large monument has been set up on the left bank . From the intersection of the parallel 46 1087 1111 1029 25 the boundary ascends the Southwest Branch , passes through a lake near its head , and so up a small stream which falls into the lake from the west to the source of that stream , which has been selected as the source of the Southwest Branch . On the Southwest Branch there are two principal forks , at each of which two monuments have been erected , one on each bank of the river immediately above the forks and upon the branch established as the boundary . The maps point out their positions . At the mouth of the small stream selected as the source of the Southwest Branch a monument has been erected upon a delta formed by two small outlets . Above those outlets three other monuments have been placed at intervals upon the same stream . Upon the crest of the dividing ridge , very close to the source of the Southwest Branch , a large monument has been erected . It is the first point in the highlands , and from it the boundary runs along the crest in a southerly direction , passing near to the southeastern shore of the Portage Lake , and so on to a large monument erected on a small eminence on the east side of the Kennebec road . Thence it passes through a dwelling house called Tachereau s , which was standing there at the time the line was run so , by a tortuous course , it runs to the top of Sandy Stream Mountain thence , inclining to the southwest , it runs over Hog Back the First , as shown in the maps thence toward Hog Back the Second , which it leaves on the north side . Further on , at the head of Leech Lake , there is a stream which divides its waters and flows both into Canada and into the United States . The boundary has been made to run up that stream a short distance from the fork where the waters divide to a second fork thence between the streams which unite to form that fork , and then to ascend again the dividing ridge . A monument has been erected at the fork first mentioned , where the waters divide . As the boundary approaches the valley of Spider River it bends to the southeast , and , by a wide circuit over high and steep hills , it turns the head of Spider River thence it bends to the northwest until it approaches within about 4 miles of Lake Megantic thence it turns again south , having the valley of Arnolds River on the right and of Dead River on the left . It leaves Gasford Mountain in Canada , threads its way over very high ground between the head of Arnolds River and the tributaries of the Magalloway inclines then to the north , so to the west , over very rocky , mountainous , and difficult country , leaving Gipps Peak in the United States , and turns by a sharp angle at Saddle Back to the south . After that it again inclines to the west , and then to the south , and again to the west , and passes the head of the Connecticut . About 3 miles and a half east of the head of the Connecticut there is a division of waters similar to that described near Leech Lake . The boundary runs down a stream from near its source to the fork where it divides , and then again follows the dividing ridge . The spot is noted on the map . After the boundary has passed the head of the Connecticut it runs to the northwest , descending into very low , swampy ground between the heads of Indian Stream and the tributaries of the Francis . Thus it passes on , bending again to the south of west , over a high hill , to the source of Halls Stream . Iron monuments have been erected at intervals along the highlands from the source of the Southwest Branch of the John to the source of Halls Stream , the position of each of which is shown upon the maps . From the source of Halls Stream the boundary descends that river , dividing the islands , which are , however , merely unimportant alluvial deposits , in the manner indicated by the maps until it reaches the intersection of that stream by the line formerly run by Valentine and Collins as the forty fifth degree of north latitude . At that point a large monument has been erected on the right and a small one on the left bank of the stream . Monuments have also been erected along the bank of this stream , as indicated on the maps . The line of Valentine and Collins was explored and found by the blazes still remaining in the original forest . Upon cutting into those blazes it was seen that deep seated in the tree there was a scar , the surface of the original blaze , slightly decayed , and upon counting the rings which indicate each year s growth of the tree it was found that the blazes dated back to 1772 , 1773 , and 1774 . The line of Valentine and Collins was run in 1771 , 1772 , 1773 , and 1774 . The coincidence of the dates of the blazes with those of the above line , confirmed by the testimony of the people of the country , satisfied the undersigned that the line they had found was that mentioned in the treaty . Along this portion of the boundary , which is known as the forty fifth degree of Valentine and Collins , and which extends from Halls Stream to Regis , there are several interruptions to the blazes in those parts where clearings have been made , and there the authentic marks of the precise situation of the old line have been lost . In those cases the undersigned have drawn the boundary line straight from the original blazes on the one side of a clearing to the original blazes on the other side of the same clearing . It can not be positively stated that the line as it has been traced through those clearings precisely coincides with the old line , but the undersigned believe that it does not differ materially from it nor have they had the means of determining a nearer or a surer approximation . Along this line , at every point of deflection , an iron monument has been erected also at the crossing of rivers , lakes , and roads . Those which mark deflections are placed , as on the north line , anglewise with the line all the others are placed square with it . The maps show the position of each . On the eastern shore of Lake Memphremagog an astronomical station was established , and on a large flat rock of granite , which happened to lie between the astronomical station and the boundary , was cut the following inscription Capt Robinson . Ast Station 422 feet north . British Boundary Meridian Line . Commission Boundary Line 595 feet south August , 1845 . A mark was cut upon the stone , as indicated by the dot upon the meridian line above , from which these measurements were made . At Rouses Point a monument of wrought stone was set up at the intersection of the boundary by the meridian of the transit instrument used there by Major Graham , and an inscription was cut upon it stating the latitude and longitude , the names of the observer and his assistant , the names of the commissioners , and the territories divided . To mark the position of the instruments used at the following astronomical stations along the west line , two monuments within a few feet of each other have been erected at each station , and they have been placed on the boundary line due north or south of the instrument , as the case may have been . The stations are Lake Memphremagog , Richford , John McCoy s , Trout River . The boundary along the west line , though very far from being a straight line , is generally about half a mile north of the true parallel of latitude 45 1087 1111 1029 from Halls Stream to Rouses Point . At about 28 miles west of Rouses Point it , however , crosses that parallel to the south until it reaches Chateaugay River , where it bends northward , and , crossing the parallel again about 4 miles east of Regis , it strikes the Lawrence 151 feet north of 45 1087 1111 1029 . At that point a large monument has been erected on the bank of the Lawrence . Two large monuments have also been erected , one on either side of the river Richelieu near Rouses Point . No marks of the old line were to be found about Regis . It was therefore agreed to run a line due west from the last blaze which should be found in the woods on the east side of Regis . That blaze occurred about 1 mile east of the Regis River . The maps , which exhibit the boundary on a scale of 4 inches to 1 statute mile , consist of 62 consecutive sheets of antiquarian paper as constructed by the British and of 61 as constructed by the American commission . A general map has also been constructed on a scale of 8 miles to 1 inch by the British and of 10 miles to 1 inch by the American commission , upon which the before mentioned sheets are represented . The following portions of the boundary have been laid down by the British commission , on detached maps , on a scale of 12 inches to 1 mile , which have been signed by both commissioners Grand Falls of the John , including the intersection of that river by the north line islands of the John the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook the turning point of the boundary on the Northwest Branch of the John the intersection of the Southwest Branch by the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 the source of the Southwest Branch the source of Halls Stream the intersection of Halls Stream by the west line Rouses Point Regis Derby . But similar maps have not been prepared by the American commission , because during the interval between the finishing of the maps of the British commission and those of the American it was thought that the maps already constructed upon a scale of 4 inches to 1 mile represented the boundary with sufficient clearness and accuracy . The astronomical observations were begun at the Grand Falls early in June , 1843 , and were carried up the John River to the Northwest Branch by a chain of stations , which , together with the results obtained , are tabulated in the appendix accompanying this report . From the valley of the John an astronomical connection was made with Quebec , and thence to Montreal , and so to Rouses Point . From Rouses Point a connection was obtained with Cambridge University , near Boston . The astronomical stations on the west line were Intersection of Halls Stream by the west line , Lake Memphremagog , Richford , Rouses Point , John McCoy s , Trout River , Regis . Latitude was also obtained at an astronomical station established for the purpose at the head of the Connecticut . Volumes containing the astronomical observations of both commissions are herewith submitted . From them it will be observed that the results for absolute longitude obtained by the British and American astronomers do not agree . It being a difference in no way affecting the survey of the boundary line , the undersigned do not feel called upon to attempt to reconcile it . The data upon which those results are based may be seen in the volumes of observations accompanying this report . In the appendix will be found , in a tabular form , the following An abstract of the survey of the boundary along the north line an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the southwest line an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the south line an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the highlands an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the west line the position of the monuments erected on the Southwest Branch of the John and on Halls Stream the distribution of the islands of the John and the monuments on them the guide lines and offsets run by each commission for the survey of the highlands the azimuths of verification for the survey of the highlands the latitudes and longitudes obtained from the astronomical observations the comparative 1ongitudes obtained , and the methods used for the purpose . Upon comparing the maps of the two commissions it will be seen that the American commission numbers two monuments more than the British . Those are to be found , one on the Fourth Island , in the river John , and the other on the highlands between the source of the Southwest Branch of the river John and the Kennebec road . On the maps of the British commission representing the west line the name of the town of Derby has been improperly placed north of the line instead of south of it . Also , on the same maps the direction of Salmon River , near the western extremity of the west line , has been incorrectly laid down from the boundary line northward . A direction has been given to it northeasterly instead of northwesterly . The above two corrections the British commissioner is authorized to make on his maps after his return to England . To avoid unnecessary delay in making their joint report , the undersigned have attached their signatures to the maps , although the lettering of some of the astronomical stations upon the maps of the American commission , as well as the alterations before mentioned in the maps of the British commission , are yet to be made but in the maps of both the boundary has been laid down accurately and definitively , and the undersigned engage that it shall not be altered in any respect . In conclusion the undersigned have the honor to report that the line of boundary described in the foregoing statement has been run , marked , and surveyed , and the accompanying maps faithfully constructed from that survey . The undersigned take leave to add that the most perfect harmony has subsisted between the two commissions from first to last , and that no differences have arisen between the undersigned in the execution of the duties intrusted to them . Signed and sealed in duplicate , at the city of Washington , this 28th day of June , 1847 . BUCKNALL ESTCOURT , Lieutenant Colonel , Her Britannic Majesty s Commissioner . ALBERT SMITH , United States Commissioner . NOTE . The astronomical computations of the American commission not being completed , and it being unnecessary to defer the signing of the report on that account , the American commissioner engages to transmit them , with any other papers or tables not yet finished , as soon as they shall be so , to the British commissioner , through the American minister resident in London , to whom , upon delivery of the documents , the British commissioner will give a receipt , to be transmitted to the American commissioner .

The season for active hostilities in Florida having nearly terminated , my attention has necessarily been directed to the course of measures to be pursued hereafter in relation to the few Indians yet remaining in that Territory . Their number is believed not to exceed 240 , of whom there are supposed to be about 80 warriors , or males capable of bearing arms . The further pursuit of these miserable beings by a large military force seems to be as injudicious as it is unavailing . The history of the last year s campaign in Florida has satisfactorily shown that notwithstanding the vigorous and incessant operations of our troops which can not be exceeded , the Indian mode of warfare , their dispersed condition , and the very smallness of their number which increases the difficulty of finding them in the abundant and almost inaccessible hiding places of the Territory render any further attempt to secure them by force impracticable except by the employment of the most expensive means . The exhibition of force and the constant efforts to capture or destroy them of course places them beyond the reach of overtures to surrender . It is believed by the distinguished officer in command there that a different system should now be pursued to attain the entire removal of all the Indians in Florida , and he recommends that hostilities should cease unless the renewal of them be rendered necessary by new aggressions that communications should be opened by means of the Indians with him to insure them a peaceful and voluntary surrender , and that the military operations should hereafter be directed to the protection of the inhabitants . These views are strengthened and corroborated by the governor of the Territory , by many of its most intelligent citizens , and by numerous officers of the Army who have served and are still serving in that region . Mature reflection has satisfied me that these recommendations are sound and just and I rejoice that consistently with duty to Florida I may indulge my desire to promote the great interests of humanity and extend the reign of peace and good will by terminating the unhappy warfare that has so long been carried on there , and at the same time gratify my anxiety to reduce the demands upon the Treasury by curtailing the extraordinary expenses which have attended the contest . I have therefore authorized the colonel in command there as soon as he shall deem it expedient to declare that hostilities against the Indians have ceased , and that they will not be renewed unless provoked and rendered indispensable by new outrages on their part , but that neither citizens nor troops are to be restrained from any necessary and proper acts of self defense against any attempts to molest them . He is instructed to open communications with those yet remaining , and endeavor by all peaceable means to persuade them to consult their true interests by joining their brethren at the West and directions have been given for establishing a cordon or line of protection for the inhabitants by the necessary number of troops . But to render this system of protection effectual it is essential that settlements of our citizens should be made within the line so established , and that they should be armed , so as to be ready to repel any attack . In order to afford inducements to such settlements , I submit to the consideration of Congress the propriety of allowing a reasonable quantity of land to the head of each family that shall permanently occupy it , and of extending the existing provisions on that subject so as to permit the issue of rations for the subsistence of the settlers for one year and as few of them will probably be provided with arms , it would be expedient to authorize the loan of muskets and the delivery of a proper quantity of cartridges or of powder and balls . By such means it is to be hoped that a hardy population will soon occupy the rich soil of the frontiers of Florida , who will be as capable as willing to defend themselves and their houses , and thus relieve the Government from further anxiety or expense for their protection .<speech_sep>
