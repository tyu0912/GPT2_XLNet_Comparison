To the House of Representatives of the United States I return to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , the bill entitled An act making appropriations for the improvement of certain harbors and rivers , with the following objections to its becoming a law At the adoption of the Constitution each State was possessed of a separate and independent sovereignty and an exclusive jurisdiction over all streams and water courses within its territorial limits . The Articles of Confederation in no way affected this authority or jurisdiction , and the present Constitution , adopted for the purpose of correcting the defects which existed in the original Articles , expressly reserves to the States all powers not delegated . No such surrender of jurisdiction is made by the States to this Government by any express grant , and if it is possessed it is to be deduced from the clause in the Constitution which invests Congress with authority to make all laws which are necessary and proper for carrying into execution the granted powers . There is , in my view of the subject , no pretense whatever for the claim to power which the bill now returned substantially sets up . The inferential power , in order to be legitimate , must be clearly and plainly incidental to some granted power and necessary to its exercise . To refer it to the head of convenience or usefulness would be to throw open the door to a boundless and unlimited discretion and to invest Congress with an unrestrained authority . The power to remove obstructions from the water courses of the States is claimed under the granted power to regulate commerce with foreign nations , among the several States , and with the Indian tribes but the plain and obvious meaning of this grant is that Congress may adopt rules and regulations prescribing the terms and conditions on which the citizens of the United States may carry on commercial operations with foreign states or kingdoms , and on which the citizens or subjects of foreign states or kingdoms may prosecute trade with the United States or either of them . And so the power to regulate commerce among the several States no more invests Congress with jurisdiction over the water courses of the States than the first branch of the grant does over the water courses of foreign powers , which would be an absurdity . The right of common use of the people of the United States to the navigable waters of each and every State arises from the express stipulation contained in the Constitution that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States . While , therefore , the navigation of any river in any State is by the laws of such State allowed to the citizens thereof , the same is also secured by the Constitution of the United States on the same terms and conditions to the citizens of every other State and so of any other privilege or immunity . The application of the revenue of this Government , if the power to do so was admitted , to improving the navigation of the rivers by removing obstructions or otherwise would be for the most part productive only of local benefit . The consequences might prove disastrously ruinous to as many of our fellow citizens as the exercise of such power would benefit . I will take one instance furnished by the present bill out of no invidious feeling , for such it would be impossible for me to feel , but because of my greater familiarity with locations in illustration of the above opinion Twenty thousand dollars are proposed to be appropriated toward improving the harbor of Richmond , in the State of Virginia . Such improvement would furnish advantages to the city of Richmond and add to the value of the property of its citizens , while it might have a most disastrous influence over the wealth and prosperity of Petersburg , which is situated some 25 miles distant on a branch of James River , and which now enjoys its fair portion of the trade . So , too , the improvement of James River to Richmond and of the Appomattox to Petersburg might , by inviting the trade to those two towns , have the effect of prostrating the town of Norfolk . This , too , might be accomplished without adding a single vessel to the number now engaged in the trade of the Chesapeake Bay or bringing into the Treasury a dollar of additional revenue . It would produce , most probably , the single effect of concentrating the commerce now profitably enjoyed by three places upon one of them . This case furnishes an apt illustration of the effect of this bill in several other particulars . There can not , in fact , be drawn the slightest discrimination between the improving the streams of a State under the power to regulate commerce and the most extended system of internal improvements on land . The excavating a canal and paving a road are equally as much incidents to such claim of power as the removing obstructions from water courses nor can such power be restricted by any fair course of reasoning to the mere fact of making the improvement . It reasonably extends also to the right of seeking a return of the means expended through the exaction of tolls and the levying of contributions . Thus , while the Constitution denies to this Government the privilege of acquiring a property in the soil of any State , even for the purpose of erecting a necessary fortification , without a grant from such State , this claim to power would invest it with control and dominion over the waters and soil of each State without restriction . Power so incongruous can not exist in the same instrument . The bill is also liable to a serious objection because of its blending appropriations for numerous objects but few of which agree in their general features . This necessarily produces the effect of embarrassing Executive action . Some of the appropriations would receive my sanction if separated from the rest , however much I might deplore the reproduction of a system which for some time past has been permitted to sleep with apparently the acquiescence of the country . I might particularize the Delaware Breakwater as an improvement which looks to the security from the storms of our extended Atlantic seaboard of the vessels of all the country engaged either in the foreign or the coastwise trade , as well as to the safety of the revenue but when , in connection with that , the same bill embraces improvements of rivers at points far in the interior , connected alone with the trade of such river and the exertion of mere local influences , no alternative is left me but to use the qualified veto with which the Executive is invested by the Constitution , and to return the bill to the House in which it originated for its ultimate reconsideration and decision . In sanctioning a bill of the same title with that returned , for the improvement of the Mississippi and its chief tributaries and certain harbors on the Lakes , if I bring myself apparently in conflict with any of the principles herein asserted it will arise on my part exclusively from the want of a just appreciation of localities . The Mississippi occupies a footing altogether different from the rivers and water courses of the different States . No one State or any number of States can exercise any other jurisdiction over it than for the punishment of crimes and the service of civil process . It belongs to no particular State or States , but of common right , by express reservation , to all the States . It is reserved as a great common highway for the commerce of the whole country . To have conceded to Louisiana , or to any other State admitted as a new State into the Union , the exclusive jurisdiction , and consequently the right to make improvements and to levy tolls on the segments of the river embraced within its territorial limits , would have been to have disappointed the chief object in the purchase of Louisiana , which was to secure the free use of the Mississippi to all the people of the United States . Whether levies on commerce were made by a foreign or domestic government would have been equally burdensome and objectionable . The United States , therefore , is charged with its improvement for the benefit of all , and the appropriation of governmental means to its improvement becomes indispensably necessary for the good of all . As to the harbors on the Lakes , the act originates no new improvements , but makes appropriations for the continuance of works already begun . It is as much the duty of the Government to construct good harbors , without reference to the location or interests of cities , for the shelter of the extensive commerce of the Lakes as to build breakwaters on the Atlantic coast for the protection of the trade of that ocean . These great inland seas are visited by destructive storms , and the annual loss of ships and cargoes , and consequently of revenue to the Government , is immense . If , then , there be any work embraced by that act which is not required in order to afford shelter and security to the shipping against the tempests which so often sweep over those great inland seas , but has , on the contrary , originated more in a spirit of speculation and local interest than in one of the character alluded to , the House of Representatives will regard my approval of the bill more as the result of misinformation than any design to abandon or modify the principles laid down in this message . Every system is liable to run into abuse , and none more so than that under consideration and measures can not be too soon taken by Congress to guard against this evil .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States If any people ever had cause to render up thanks to the Supreme Being for parental care and protection extended to them in all the trials and difficulties to which they have been from time to time exposed , we certainly are that people . From the first settlement of our forefathers on this continent , through the dangers attendant upon the occupation of a savage wilderness , through a long period of colonial dependence , through the War of the Revolution , in the wisdom which led to the adoption of the existing forms of republican government , in the hazards incident to a war subsequently waged with one of the most powerful nations of the earth , in the increase of our population , in the spread of the arts and sciences , and in the strength and durability conferred on political institutions emanating from the people and sustained by their will , the superintendence of an overruling Providence has been plainly visible . As preparatory , therefore , to entering once more upon the high duties of legislation , it becomes us humbly to acknowledge our dependence upon Him as our guide and protector and to implore a continuance of His parental watchfulness over our beloved country . We have new cause for the expression of our gratitude in the preservation of the health of our fellow citizens , with some partial and local exceptions , during the past season , for the abundance with which the earth has yielded up its fruits to the labors of the husbandman , for the renewed activity which has been imparted to commerce , for the revival of trade in all its departments , for the increased rewards attendant on the exercise of the mechanic arts , for the continued growth of our population and the rapidly reviving prosperity of the whole country . I shall be permitted to exchange congratulations with you , gentlemen of the two Houses of Congress , on these auspicious circumstances , and to assure you in advance of my ready disposition to cur with you in the adoption of all such measures as shall be calculated to increase the happiness of our constituents and to advance the glory of our common country . Since the last adjournment of Congress the Executive has relaxed no effort to render indestructible the relations of amity which so happily exist between the United States and other countries . The treaty lately concluded with Great Britain has tended greatly to increase the good understanding which a reciprocity of interests is calculated to encourage , and it is most ardently to be hoped that nothing may transpire to interrupt the relations of amity which it is so obviously the policy of both nations to cultivate . A question of much importance still remains to be adjusted between them . The territorial limits of the two countries relation to what is commonly known as the Oregon Territory still remain in dispute . The United States would be at all times indisposed to aggrandize itself at the expense of any other nation but while they would be restrained by principles of honor , which should govern the conduct of nations as well as that of individuals , from setting up a demand for territory which does not belong to them , they would as unwillingly sent to a surrender of their rights . After the most rigid and , as far as practicable , unbiased examination of the subject , the United States have always contended that their rights appertain to the entire region of country lying on the Pacific and embraced within 42 deg and 54 deg 40 of north latitude . This claim being controverted by Great Britain , those who have preceded the present Executive actuated , no doubt , by an earnest desire to adjust the matter upon terms mutually satisfactory to both countries have caused to be submitted to the British Government propositions for settlement and final adjustment , which , however , have not proved heretofore acceptable to it . Our minister at London has , under instructions , again brought the subject to the consideration of that Government , and while nothing will be done to compromise the rights or honor of the United States , every proper expedient will be resorted to in order to bring the negotiation now in the progress of resumption to a speedy and happy termination . In the meantime it is proper to remark that many of our citizens are either already established in the Territory or are on their way thither for the purpose of forming permanent settlements , while others are preparing to follow and in view of these facts I must repeat the recommendation contained in previous messages for the establishment of military posts at such places on the line of travel as will furnish security and protection to our hardy adventurers against hostile tribes of Indians inhabiting those extensive regions . Our laws should also follow them , so modified as the circumstances of the case may seem to require . Under the influence of our free system of government new republics are destined to spring up at no distant day on the shores of the Pacific similar in policy and in feeling to those existing on this side of the Rocky Mountains , and giving a wider and more extensive spread to the principles of civil and religious liberty . I am happy to inform you that the cases which have from time to time arisen of the detention of American vessels by British cruisers on the coast of Africa under pretense of being engaged in the slave trade have been placed in a fair train of adjustment . In the case of the William and Francis full satisfaction will be allowed . In the cases of the Tygris and Seamew the British Government admits that satisfaction is due . In the case of the Jones the sum accruing from the sale of that vessel and cargo will be paid to the owners , while I can not but flatter myself that full indemnification will be allowed for all damages sustained by the detention of the vessel and in the case of the Douglas Her Majesty s Government has expressed its determination to make indemnification . Strong hopes are therefore entertained that most , if not all , of these cases will be speedily adjusted . No new cases have arisen since the ratification of the treaty of Washington , and it is confidently anticipated that the slave trade , under the operation of the eighth article of that treaty , will be altogether suppressed . The occasional interruption experienced by our fellow citizens engaged in the fisheries on the neighboring coast of Nova Scotia has not failed to claim the attention of the Executive . Representations upon this subject have been made , but as yet no definitive answer to those representations has been received from the British Government . Two other subjects of comparatively minor importance , but nevertheless of too much consequence to be neglected , remain still to be adjusted between the two countries . By the treaty between the United States and Great Britain of July , 1815 , it is provided that no higher duties shall be levied in either country on articles imported from the other than on the same articles imported from any other place . In 1836 rough rice by act of Parliament was admitted from the coast of Africa into Great Britain on the payment of a duty of 1 penny a quarter , while the same article from all other countries , including the United States , was subjected to the payment of a duty of 20 shillings a quarter . Our minister at London has from time to time brought this subject to the attention of the British Government , but so far without success . He is instructed to renew his representations upon it . Some years since a claim was preferred against the British Government on the part of certain American merchants for the return of export duties paid by them on shipments of woolen goods to the United States after the duty on similar articles exported to other countries had been repealed , and consequently in contravention of the commercial convention between the two nations securing to us equality in such cases . The principle on which the claim rests has long since been virtually admitted by Great Britain , but obstacles to a settlement have from time to time been interposed , so that a large portion of the amount claimed has not yet been refunded . Our minister is now engaged in the prosecution of the claim , and I can not but persuade myself that the British Government will no longer delay its adjustment . I am happy to be able to say that nothing has occurred to disturb in any degree the relations of amity which exist between the United States and France , Austria , and Russia , as well as with the other powers of Europe , since the adjournment of Congress . Spain has been agitated with internal convulsions for many years , from the effects of which , it is hoped , she is destined speedily to recover , when , under a more liberal system of commercial policy on her part , our trade with her may again fill its old and , so far as her continental possessions are concerned , its almost forsaken channels , thereby adding to the mutual prosperity of the two countries . The Germanic Association of Customs and Commerce , which since its establishment in 1833 has been steadily growing in power and importance , and consists at this time of more than twenty German States , and embraces a population of 27 , 000 , 000 people united for all fire purposes of commercial intercourse with each other and with foreign states , offers to the latter the most valuable exchanges on principles more liberal than are offered in the fiscal system of any other European power . From its origin the importance of the German union has never been lost sight of by the United States . The industry , morality , and other valuable qualities of the German nation have always been well known and appreciated . On this subject I invite the attention of Congress to the report of the Secretary of State , from which it will be seen that while our cotton is admitted free of duty and the duty on rice has been much reduced which has already led to a greatly increased consumption , a strong disposition has been recently evinced by that great body to reduce , upon certain conditions , their present duty upon tobacco . This being the first intimation of a concession on this interesting subject ever made by any European power , I can not but regard it as well calculated to remove the only impediment which has so far existed to the most liberal commercial intercourse between us and them . In this view our minister at Berlin , who has heretofore industriously pursued the subject , has been instructed to enter upon the negotiation of a commercial treaty , which , while it will open new advantages to the agricultural interests of the United States and a more free and expanded field for commercial operations , will affect injuriously no existing interest of the Union . Should the negotiation be crowned with success , its results will be communicated to both Houses of Congress . I communicate herewith certain dispatches received from our minister at Mexico , and also a correspondence which has recently occurred between the envoy from that Republic and the Secretary of State . It must but be regarded as not a little extraordinary that the Government of Mexico , in anticipation of a public discussion which it has been pleased to infer from newspaper publications as likely to take place in Congress , relating to the annexation of Texas to the United States , should have so far anticipated the result of such discussion as to have announced its determination to visit any such anticipated decision by a formal declaration of war against the United States . If designed to prevent Congress from introducing that question as a fit subject for its calm deliberation and final judgment , the Executive has no reason to doubt that it will entirely fail of its object . The representatives of a brave and patriotic people will suffer no apprehension of future consequences to embarrass them in the course of their proposed deliberations , nor will the executive department of the Government fail for any such cause to discharge its whole duty to the country . The war which has existed for so long a time between Mexico and Texas has since the battle of San Jacinto consisted for the most part of predatory incursions , which , while they have been attended with much of suffering to individuals and have kept the borders of the two countries in a state of constant alarm , have failed to approach to any definitive result . Mexico has fitted out no formidable armament by land or by sea for the subjugation of Texas . Eight years have now elapsed since Texas declared her independence of Mexico , and during that time she has been recognized as a sovereign power by several of the principal civilized states . Mexico , nevertheless , perseveres in her plans of reconquest , and refuses to recognize her independence . The predatory incursions to which I have alluded have been attended in one instance with the breaking up of the courts of justice , by the seizing upon the persons of the judges , jury , and officers of the court and dragging them along with unarmed , and therefore noncombatant , citizens into a cruel and oppressive bondage , thus leaving crime to go unpunished and immorality to pass unreproved . A border warfare is evermore to be deprecated , and over such a war as has existed for so many years between these two States humanity has had great cause to lament . Nor is such a condition of things to be deplored only because of the individual suffering attendant upon it . The effects are far more extensive . The Creator of the Universe has given man the earth for his resting place and its fruits for his subsistence . Whatever , therefore , shall make the first or any part of it a scene of desolation affects injuriously his heritage and may be regarded as a general calamity . Wars may sometimes be necessary , but all nations have a common interest in bringing them speedily to a close . The United States have an immediate interest in seeing an end put to the state of hostilities existing between Mexico and Texas . They are our neighbors , of the same continent , with whom we are not only desirous of cultivating the relations of amity , but of the most extended commercial intercourse , and to practice all the rites of a neighborhood hospitality . Our own interests are involved in the matter , since , however neutral may be our course of policy , we can not hope to escape the effects of a spirit of jealousy on the part of both of the powers . Nor can this Government be indifferent to the fact that a warfare such as is waged between those two nations is calculated to weaken both powers and finally to render them and especially the weaker of the two the subjects of interference on the part of stronger and more powerful nations , who , intent only on advancing their own peculiar views , may sooner or later attempt to bring about a compliance with terms as the condition of their interposition alike derogatory to the nation granting them and detrimental to the interests of the United States . We could not be expected quietly to permit any such interference to our disadvantage . Considering that Texas is separated from the United States by a mere geographical line that her territory , in the opinion of many , down to a late period formed a portion of the territory of the United States that it is homogeneous in its population and pursuits with adjoining States , makes contributions to the commerce of the world in the same articles with them , and that most of her inhabitants have been citizens of the United States , speak the same language , and live under similar political institutions with ourselves , this Government is bound by every consideration of interest as well as of sympathy to see that she shall be left free to act , especially in regard to her domestic affairs , unawed by force and unrestrained by the policy or views of other countries . In full view of all these considerations , the Executive has not hesitated to express to the Government of Mexico how deeply it deprecated a continuance of the war and how anxiously it desired to witness its termination . I can not but think that it becomes the United States , as the oldest of the American Republics , to hold a language to Mexico upon this subject of an unambiguous character . It is time that this war had ceased . There must be a limit to all wars , and if the parent state after an eight years struggle has failed to reduce to submission a portion of its subjects standing out in revolt against it , and who have not only proclaimed themselves to be independent , but have been recognized as such by other powers , she ought not to expect that other nations will quietly look on , to their obvious injury , upon a protraction of hostilities . These United States threw off their colonial dependence and established independent governments , and Great Britain , after having wasted her energies in the attempt to subdue them for a less period than Mexico has attempted to subjugate Texas , had the wisdom and justice to acknowledge their independence , thereby recognizing the obligation which rested on her as one of the family of nations . An example thus set by one of the proudest as well as most powerful nations of the earth it could in no way disparage Mexico to imitate . While , therefore , the Executive would deplore any collision with Mexico or any disturbance of the friendly relations which exist between the two countries , it can not permit that Government to control its policy , whatever it may be , toward Texas , but will treat her as by the recognition of her independence the United States have long since declared they would do as entirely independent of Mexico . The high obligations of public duty may enforce from the constituted authorities of the United States a policy which the course persevered in by Mexico will have mainly contributed to produce , and the Executive in such a touting they will with confidence throw itself upon the patriotism of the people to sustain the Government in its course of action . Measures of an unusual character have recently been adopted by the Mexican Government , calculated in no small degree to affect the trade of other nations with Mexico and to operate injuriously to the United States . All foreigners , by a decree of the 23d day of September , and after six months from the day of its promulgation , are forbidden to carry on the business of selling by retail any goods within the confines of Mexico . Against this decree our minister has not failed to remonstrate . The trade heretofore carried on by our citizens with Santa Fe , in which much capital was already invested and which was becoming of daily increasing importance , has suddenly been arrested by a decree of virtual prohibition on the part of the Mexican Government . Whatever may be the right of Mexico to prohibit any particular course of trade to the citizens or subjects of foreign powers , this late procedure , to say the least of it , wears a harsh and unfriendly aspect . The installments on the claims recently settled by the convention with Mexico have been punctually paid as they have fallen due , and our minister is engaged in urging the establishment of a new commission in pursuance of the convention for the settlement of unadjusted claims . With the other American States our relations of amity and good will have remained uninterrupted . Our minister near the Republic of New Granada has succeeded in effecting an adjustment of the claim upon that Government for the schooner By Chance , which had been pending for many years . The claim for the brig Morris , which had its origin during the existence of the Republic of Colombia , and indemnification for which since the dissolution of that Republic has devolved upon its several members , will be urged with renewed zeal . I have much pleasure in saying that the Government of Brazil has adjusted the claim upon that Government in the case of the schooner John Bryan , and that sanguine hopes are entertained that the same spirit of justice will influence its councils in arriving at an early decision upon the remaining claims , thereby removing all cause of dissension between two powers whose interests are to some extent interwoven with each other . Our minister at Chili has succeeded in inducing a recognition by that Government of the adjustment effected by his predecessor of the first claim in the case of the Macedonian . The first installment has been received by the claimants in the United States . Notice of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty with Peru , which will take place at Lima , has not yet reached this country , but is shortly expected to be received , when the claims upon that Republic will doubtless be liquidated and paid . In consequence of a misunderstanding between this Government and that of Buenos Ayres , occurring several years ago , this Government has remained unrepresented at that Court , while a minister from it has been constantly resident here . The causes of irritation have in a great measure passed away , and it is in contemplation , in view of important interests which have grown up in that country , at some early period during the present session of Congress , with the concurrence of the Senate , to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries . Under the provisions of an act of Congress of the last session a minister was dispatched from the United States to China in August of the present year , who , from the latest accounts we have from him , was at Suez , in Egypt , on the 25th of September last , on his route to China . In regard to the Indian tribes residing within our jurisdictional limits , the greatest vigilance of the Government has been exerted to preserve them at peace among themselves and to inspire them with feelings of confidence in the justice of this Government and to cultivate friendship with the border inhabitants . This has happily succeeded to a great extent , but it is a subject of regret that they suffer themselves in some instances to be imposed upon by artful and designing men and this notwithstanding all efforts of the Government to prevent it . The receipts into the Treasury for the calendar year 1843 , exclusive of loans , were little more than 18 , 000 , 000 , and the expenditures , exclusive of the payments on the public debt , will have been about 23 , 000 , 000 . By the act of 1842 a new arrangement of the fiscal year was made , so that it should commence on the 1st day of July in each year . The accounts and estimates for the current fiscal year will show that the loans and Treasury notes made and issued before the close of the last Congress to meet the anticipated deficiency have not been entirely adequate . Although on the 1st of October last there was a balance in the Treasury , in consequence of the provisions thus made , of 3 , 914 , 082 . 77 , yet the appropriations already made by Congress will absorb that balance and leave a probable deficiency of 2 , 000 , 000 at the close of the present fiscal year . There are outstanding Treasury notes to about the amount of 4 , 600 , 000 , and should they be returned upon the Treasury during the fiscal year they will require provision for their redemption . I do not , however , regard this as probable , since they have obviously entered into the currency of the country and will continue to form a portion of it if the system now adopted be continued . The loan of 1841 , amounting to 5 , 672 , 976 . 88 , falls due on the 1st day of January , 1845 , and must be provided for or postponed by a new loan and unless the resources of revenue should be materially increased by you there will be a probable deficiency for the service of the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1845 , of upward of 4 , 000 , 000 . The delusion incident to an enormously excessive paper circulation , which gave a fictitious value to everything and stimulated adventure and speculation to an extravagant extent , has been happily succeeded by the substitution of the precious metals and paper promptly redeemable in specie and thus false values have disappeared and a sounder condition of things has been introduced . This transition , although intimately connected with the prosperity of the country , has nevertheless been attended with much embarrassment to the Government in its financial concerns . So long as the foreign importers could receive payment for their cargoes in a currency of greatly less value than that in Europe , but fully available here in the purchase of our agricultural productions their profits being immeasurably augmented by the operation , the shipments were large and the revenues of the Government became superabundant . But the change in the character of the circulation from a nominal and apparently real value in the first stage of its existence to an obviously depreciated value in its second , so that it no longer answered the purposes of exchange or barter , and its ultimate substitution by a sound metallic and paper circulation combined , has been attended by diminished importations and a consequent falling off in the revenue . This has induced Congress , from 1837 , to resort to the expedient of issuing Treasury notes , and finally of funding them , in order to supply deficiencies . I can not , however , withhold the remark that it is in no way compatible with the dignity of the Government that a public debt should be created in time of peace to meet the current expenses of the Government , or that temporary expedients should be resorted to an hour longer than it is possible to avoid them . The Executive can do no more than apply the means which Congress places in its hands for the support of Government , and , happily for the good of the country and for the preservation of its liberties , it possesses no power to levy exactions on the people or to force from them contributions to the public revenue in any form . It can only recommend such measures as may in its opinion be called for by the wants of the public service to Congress , with whom alone rests the power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises . This duty has upon several occasions heretofore been performed . The present condition of things gives flattering promise that trade and commerce are rapidly reviving , and , fortunately for the country , the sources of revenue have only to be opened in order to prove abundant . While we can anticipate no considerable increase in the proceeds of the sales of the public lands , for reasons perfectly obvious to all , for several years to come , yet the public lands can not otherwise than be regarded as the foundation of the public credit . With so large a body of the most fertile lands in the world under the control and at the disposal of this Government , no one can reasonably doubt the entire ability to meet its engagements under every emergency . In seasons of trial and difficulty similar to those through which we are passing the capitalist makes his investments in the Government cut stocks with the most assured confidence of ultimate reimbursement and whatever may be said of a period of great financial prosperity , such as existed for some years after 1833 , I should regard it as suicidal in a season of financial embarrassment either to alienate the lands themselves or the proceeds arising from their sales . The first and paramount duty of those to whom may be intrusted the administration of public affairs is to guard the public credit . In reestablishing the credit of this central Government the readiest and most obvious mode is taken to restore the credit of the States . The extremities can only be made sound by producing a healthy action in the central Government , and the history of the present day fully establishes the fact that an increase in the value of the stocks of this Government will in a great majority of instances be attended by an increase in the value of the stocks of the States . It should therefore be a matter of general congratulation that amidst all the embarrassments arising from surrounding circumstances the credit of the Government should have been so fully restored that it has been enabled to effect a loan of 7 , 000 , 000 to redeem that amount of Treasury notes on terms more favorable than any that have been offered for many years . And the 6 per cent stock which was created in 1842 has advanced in the hands of the holders nearly 20 per cent above its par value . The confidence of the people in the integrity of their Government has thus been signally manifested . These opinions relative to the public lands do not in any manner conflict with the observance of the most liberal policy toward those of our fellow citizens who press forward into the wilderness and are the pioneers in the work of its reclamation . In securing to all such their rights of preemption the Government performs but an act of retributive justice for sufferings encountered and hardships endured , and finds ample remuneration in the comforts which its policy insures and the happiness which it imparts . Should a revision of the tariff with a view to revenue become necessary in the estimation of Congress , I doubt not you will approach the subject with a just and enlightened regard to the interests of the whole Union . The principles and views which I have heretofore had occasion to submit remain unchanged . It can , however , never be too often repeated that the prominent interest of every important pursuit of life requires for success permanency and stability in legislation . These can only be attained by adopting as the basis of action moderation in all things , which is as indispensably necessary to secure the harmonious action of the political as of the animal system . In our political organization no one section of the country should desire to have its supposed interests advanced at the sacrifice of all others , but union , being the great interest , equally precious to all , should be fostered and sustained by mutual concessions and the cultivation of that spirit of compromise from which the Constitution itself proceeded . You will be informed by the report from the Treasury Department of the measures taken under the act of the last session authorizing the reissue of Treasury notes in lieu of those then outstanding . The system adopted in pursuance of existing laws seems well calculated to save the country a large amount of interest , while it affords conveniences and obviates dangers and expense in the transmission of funds to disbursing agents . I refer you also to that report for the means proposed by the Secretary to increase the revenue , and particularly to that portion of it which relates to the subject of the warehousing system , which I earnestly urged upon Congress at its last session and as to the importance of which my opinion has undergone no change . In view of the disordered condition of the currency at the time and the high rates of exchange between different parts of the country , I felt it to be incumbent on me to present to the consideration of your predecessors a proposition conflicting in no degree with the Constitution or with the rights of the States and having the sanction not in detail , but in principle of some of the eminent men who have preceded me in the Executive office . That proposition contemplated the issuing of Treasury notes of denominations of not less than 5 nor more than 100 , to be employed in the payment of the obligations of the Government in lieu of gold and silver at the option of the public creditor , and to an amount not exceeding 15 , 000 , 000 . It was proposed to make them receivable everywhere and to establish at various points depositories of gold and silver to be held in trust for the redemption of such notes , so as to insure their convertibility into specie . No doubt was entertained that such notes would have maintained a par value with gold and silver , thus furnishing a paper currency of equal value over the Union , thereby meeting the just expectations of the people and fulfilling the duties of a parental government . Whether the depositories should be permitted to sell or purchase bills under very limited restrictions , together with all its other details , was submitted to the wisdom of Congress and was regarded as of secondary importance . I thought then and think now that such an arrangement would have been attended with the happiest results . The whole matter of the currency would have been placed where by the Constitution it was designed to be placed under the immediate supervision and control of Congress . The action of the Government would have been independent of all corporations , and the same eye which rests unceasingly on the specie currency and guards it against adulteration would also have rested on the paper currency , to control and regulate its issues and protect it against depreciation . The same reasons which would forbid Congress from parting with the power over the coinage would seem to operate with nearly equal force hi regard to any substitution for the precious metals in the form of a circulating medium . Paper when substituted for specie constitutes a standard of value by which the operations of society are regulated , and whatsoever causes its depreciation affects society to an extent nearly , if not quite , equal to the adulteration of the coin . Nor can I withhold the remark that its advantages contrasted with a bank of the United States , apart from the fact that a bank was esteemed as obnoxious to the public sentiment as well on the score of expediency as of constitutionality , appeared to me to be striking and obvious . The relief which a bank would afford by an issue of 15 , 000 , 000 of its notes , judging from the experience of the late United States Bank , would not have occurred in less than fifteen years , whereas under the proposed arrangement the relief arising from the issue of 15 , 000 , 000 of Treasury notes would have been consummated in one year , thus furnishing in one fifteenth part of the time in which a bank could have accomplished it a paper medium of exchange equal in amount to the real wants of the country at par value with gold and silver . The saving to the Government would have been equal to all the interest which it has had to pay on Treasury notes of previous as well as subsequent issues , thereby relieving the Government and at the same time affording relief to the people . Under all the responsibilities attached to the station which I occupy , and in redemption of a pledge given to the last Congress at the close of its first session , I submitted the suggestion to its consideration at two consecutive sessions . The recommendation , however , met with no favor at its hands . While I am free to admit that the necessities of the times have since become greatly ameliorated and that there is good reason to hope that the country is safely and rapidly emerging from the difficulties and embarrassments which everywhere surrounded it in 1841 , yet I can not but think that its restoration to a sound and healthy condition would be greatly expedited by a resort to the expedient in a modified form . The operations of the Treasury now rest upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816 , and those laws have been so administered as to produce as great a quantum of good to the country as their provisions are capable of yielding . If there had been any distinct expression of opinion going to show that public sentiment is averse to the plan , either as heretofore recommended to Congress or in a modified form , while my own opinion in regard to it would remain unchanged I should be very far from again presenting it to your consideration . The Government has originated with the States and the people , for their own benefit and advantage , and it would be subversive of the foundation principles of the political edifice which they have reared to persevere in a measure which in their mature judgments they had either repudiated or condemned . The will of our constituents clearly expressed should be regarded as the light to guide our footsteps , the true difference between a monarchical or aristocratical government and a republic being that in the first the will of the few prevails over the will of the many , while in the last the will of the many should be alone consulted . The report of the Secretary of War will bring you acquainted with the condition of that important branch of the public service . The Army may be regarded , in consequence of the small number of the rank and file in each company and regiment , as little more than a nucleus around which to rally the military force of the country in case of war , and yet its services in preserving the peace of the frontiers are of a most important nature . In all cases of emergency the reliance of the country is properly placed in the militia of the several States , and it may well deserve the consideration of Congress whether a new and more perfect organization might not be introduced , looking mainly to the volunteer companies of the Union for the present and of easy application to the great body of the militia in time of war . The expenditures of the War Department have been considerably reduced in the last two years . Contingencies , however , may arise which would call for the filling up of the regiments with a full complement of men and make it very desirable to remount the corps of dragoons , which by an act of the last Congress was directed to be dissolved . I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary for information in relation to the Navy of the United States . While every effort has been and will continue to be made to retrench all superfluities and lop off all excrescences which from time to time may have grown up , yet it has not been regarded as wise or prudent to recommend any material change in the annual appropriations . The interests which are involved are of too important a character to lead to the recommendation of any other than a liberal policy . Adequate appropriations ought to be made to enable the Executive to fit out all the ships that are now in a course of building or that require repairs for active service in the shortest possible time should any emergency arise which may require it . An efficient navy , while it is the cheapest means of public defense , enlists in its support the feelings of pride and confidence which brilliant deeds and heroic valor have heretofore served to strengthen and confirm . I refer you particularly to that part of the Secretary s report which has reference to recent experiments in the application of steam and in the construction of our war steamers , made under the superintendence of distinguished officers of the Navy . In addition to other manifest improvements in the construction of the steam engine and application of the motive power which has rendered them more appropriate to the uses of ships of war , one of those officers has brought into use a power which makes the steamship most formidable either for attack or defense . I can not too strongly recommend this subject to your consideration and do not hesitate to express my entire conviction of its great importance . I call your particular attention also to that portion of the Secretary s report which has reference to the act of the late session of Congress which prohibited the transfer of any balance of appropriation from other heads of appropriation to that for building , equipment , and repair . The repeal of that prohibition will enable the Department to give renewed employment to a large class of workmen who have been necessarily discharged in consequence of the want of means to pay them a circumstance attended , especially at this season of the year , with much privation and suffering . It gives me great pain to announce to you the loss of the steamship the Missouri by fire in the Bay of Gibraltar , where she had stopped to renew her supplies of coal on her voyage to Alexandria , with Cushing , the American minister to China , on board . There is ground for high commendation of the officers and men for the coolness and intrepidity and perfect submission to discipline evinced under the most trying circumstances . Surrounded by a raging fire , which the utmost exertions could not subdue , and which threatened momentarily the explosion of her well supplied magazines , the officers exhibited no signs of fear and the men obeyed every order with alacrity . Nor was she abandoned until the last gleam of hope of saving her had expired . It is well worthy of your consideration whether the losses sustained by the officers and crew in this unfortunate affair should not be reimbursed to them . I can not take leave of this painful subject without adverting to the aid rendered upon the occasion by the British authorities at Gibraltar and the commander , officers , and crew of the British ship of the line the Malabar , which was lying at the time in the bay . Everything that generosity or humanity could dictate was promptly performed . It is by such acts of good will by one to another of the family of nations that fraternal feelings are nourished and the blessings of permanent peace secured . The report of the Postmaster General will bring you acquainted with the operations of that Department during the past year , and will suggest to you such modifications of the existing laws as in your opinion the exigencies of the public service may require . The change which the country has undergone of late years in the mode of travel and transportation has afforded so many facilities for the transmission of mail matter out of the regular mail as to require the greatest vigilance and circumspection in order to enable the officer at the head of the Department to restrain the expenditures within the income . There is also too much reason to fear that the franking privilege has run into great abuse . The Department , nevertheless , has been conducted with the greatest vigor , and has attained at the least possible expense all the useful objects for which it was established . In regard to all the Departments , I am quite happy in the belief that nothing has been left undone which was called for by a true spirit of economy or by a system of accountability rigidly enforced . This is in some degree apparent from the fact that the Government has sustained no loss by the default of any of its agents . In the complex , but at the same time beautiful , machinery of our system of government , it is not a matter of surprise that some remote agency may have failed for an instant to fulfill its desired office but I feel confident in the assertion that nothing has occurred to interrupt the harmonious action of the Government itself , and that , while the laws have been executed with efficiency and vigor , the rights neither of States nor individuals have been trampled on or disregarded . In the meantime the country has been steadily advancing in all that contributes to national greatness . The tide of population continues unbrokenly to flow into the new States and Territories , where a refuge is found not only for our native born fellow citizens , but for emigrants from all parts of the civilized world , who come among us to partake of the blessings of our free institutions and to aid by their labor to swell the current of our wealth and power . It is due to every consideration of public policy that the lakes and rivers of the West should receive all such attention at the hands of Congress as the Constitution will enable it to bestow . Works in favorable and proper situations on the Lakes would be found to be as indispensably necessary , in case of war , to carry on safe and successful naval operations as fortifications on the Atlantic seaboard . The appropriation made by the last Congress for the improvement of the navigation of the Mississippi River has been diligently and efficiently applied . I can not close this communication , gentlemen , without recommending to your most favorable consideration the interests of this District . Appointed by the Constitution its exclusive legislators , and forming in this particular the only anomaly in our system of government of the legislative body being elected by others than those for whose advantage they are to legislate you will feel a superadded obligation to look well into their condition and to leave no cause for complaint or regret . The seat of Government of our associated republics can not but be regarded as worthy of your parental care . In connection with its other interests , as well as those of the whole country , I recommend that at your present session you adopt such measures in order to carry into effect the Smithsonian bequest as in your judgment will be best calculated to consummate the liberal intent of the testator . When , under a dispensation of Divine Providence , I succeeded to the presidential office , the state of public affairs was embarrassing and critical . To add to the irritation consequent upon a long standing controversy with one of the most powerful nations of modern times , involving not only questions of boundary which under the most favorable circumstances are always embarrassing , but at the same time important and high principles of maritime law , border controversies between the citizens and subjects of the two countries had engendered a state of feeling and of conduct which threatened the most calamitous consequences . The hazards incident to this state of things were greatly heightened by the arrest and imprisonment of a subject of Great Britain , who , acting as it was alleged as a part of a military force , had aided in the commission of an act violative of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and involving the murder of a citizen , of the State of New York . A large amount of claims against the Government of Mexico remained unadjusted and a war of several years continuance with the savage tribes of Florida still prevailed , attended with the desolation of a large portion of that beautiful Territory and with the sacrifice of many valuable lives . To increase the embarrassments of the Government , individual and State credit had been nearly stricken down and confidence in the General Government was so much impaired that loans of a small amount could only be negotiated at a considerable sacrifice . As a necessary consequence of the blight which had fallen on commerce and mechanical industry , the ships of the one were thrown out of employment and the operations of the other had been greatly diminished . Owing to the condition of the currency , exchanges between different parts of the country had become ruinously high and trade had to depend on a depreciated paper currency in conducting its transactions . I shall be permitted to congratulate the country that under an overruling Providence peace was preserved without a sacrifice of the national honor the war in Florida was brought to a speedy termination a large portion of the claims on Mexico have been fully adjudicated and are in a course of payment , while justice has been rendered to us in other matters by other nations confidence between man and man is in a great measure restored and the credit of this Government fully and perfectly reestablished commerce is becoming more and more extended in its operations and manufacturing and mechanical industry once more reap the rewards of skill and labor honestly applied the operations of trade rest on a sound currency and the rates of exchange are reduced to their lowest amount . In this condition of things I have felt it to be my duty to bring to your favorable consideration matters of great interest in their present and ultimate results and the only desire which I feel in connection with the future is and will continue to be to leave the country prosperous and its institutions unimpaired .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I transmit to the Senate , for its consideration with a view to its ratification , a treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation with the Republic of Texas , negotiated at the seat of Government of the United States between the Secretary of State , duly empowered for that purpose , and the charge d affaires of that Republic . In forming the first commercial treaty between the two Governments an anxious desire has been felt to introduce such provisions as should promote the interests of both countries . The immediate proximity of Texas to the United States and the consequent facility of intercourse , the nature of its principal agricultural production , and the relations which both countries bear to several large rivers which are boundaries between them , and which in some part of their course run within the territories of both , have caused peculiarities of condition and interests which it has been necessary to guard . The treaty provides that Texas shall enjoy a right of deposit for such of her productions as may be introduced into the United States for exportation , but upon the condition that the Executive of the United States may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the proper enjoyment of the privilege within our territory . It was thought no more than reasonable to grant this facility to the trade of Texas , under such conditions as seem best calculated to guard against abuse or inconvenience . The treaty further provides that raw cotton may be imported from either country into the other free of duties . In general it is not wise to enter into treaty stipulations respecting duties of import they are usually much better left to the operation of general laws . But there are circumstances existing in this case which have been thought to justify a departure from the general rule , and the addition of it to the number of instances , not large , in which regulations of duties of imports have been made the subject of national compact . The United States consume large quantities of raw cotton , but they are exporters of the article to a still greater extent . Texas , for the present at least , exports her whole crop . These exportations are , in general , to the same foreign markets , and it is supposed to be of no considerable importance to the American producer whether he meets the Texan product at home or abroad . On the other hand , it is thought that a useful commercial intercourse would be promoted in several ways by receiving the raw cotton of Texas at once into the United States free of duty . The tendency of such a measure is to bring to the United States , in the first instance , Texan cotton ultimately destined to European markets . The natural effect of this , it is supposed , will be to increase the business of the cities of the United States to the extent of this importation and exportation , and to secure a further degree of employment to the navigation of the country . But these are by no means all the benefits which may be reasonably expected from the arrangement . Texas , at least for a considerable time to come , must import all the manufactured articles and much of the supplies and provisions necessary for her use and consumption . These commodities she will be likely to obtain , if to be had , in the markets of the country in which she disposes of her main annual product . The manufactures of the North and East , therefore , and the grain and provisions of the Western States are likely to find in Texas a demand , increased by whatever augments intercourse between the two countries , and especially by whatever tends to give attraction to the cities of the United States as marts for the sale of her great and principal article of export . As a security however , against unforeseen results or occurrences , it has been thought advisable to give this article of the treaty a limitation of five years .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States I transmit herewith , for the information of Congress , copies of certain dispatches recently received from Wise , our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at the Court of Brazil , upon the subject of the slave trade , developing the means used and the devices resorted to hi order to evade existing enactments upon that subject . Anxiously desirous as are the United States to suppress a traffic so revolting to humanity , in the efforts to accomplish which they have been the pioneers of civilized states , it can not but be a subject of the most profound regret that any portion of our citizens should be found acting in cooperation with the subjects of other powers in opposition to the policy of their own Government , thereby subjecting to suspicion and to the hazard of disgrace the flag of their own country . It is true that this traffic is carried on altogether in foreign parts and that our own coasts are free from its pollution but the crime remains the same wherever perpetrated , and there are many circumstances to warrant the belief that some of our citizens are deeply involved in its guilt . The mode and manner of carrying on this trade are clearly and fearlessly set forth in the accompanying documents , and it would seem that a regular system has been adopted for the purpose of thwarting the policy and evading the penalties of our laws . American vessels , with the knowledge , as there are good reasons to believe , of the owners and masters , are chartered , or rather purchased , by notorious slave dealers in Brazil , aided by English brokers and capitalists , with this intent . The vessel is only nominally chartered at so much per month , while in truth it is actually sold , to be delivered on the coast of Africa the charter party binding the owners in the meantime to take on board as passengers a new crew in Brazil , who , when delivered on the coast , are to navigate her back to the ports of Brazil with her cargo of slaves . Under this agreement the vessel clears from the United States for some port in Great Britain , where a cargo of merchandise known as coast goods , and designed especially for the African trade , is purchased , shipped , and consigned , together with the vessel , either directly to the slave dealer himself or to his agents or accomplices in Brazil . On her arrival a new crew is put on board as passengers and the vessel and cargo consigned to an equally guilty factor or agent on the coast of Africa , where the unlawful purpose originally designed is finally consummated . The merchandise is exchanged for slaves , the vessel is delivered up , her name obliterated , her papers destroyed , her American crew discharged , to be provided for by the charters , and the new or passenger crew put in command to carry back its miserable freight to the first contrivers of the voyage , or their employees in Brazil . During the whole progress of this tortuous enterprise it is possible that neither the American crew originally enlisted nor the passenger crew put on board in the Brazilian ports are aware of the nature of the voyage , and yet it is on these principally , ignorant if not innocent , that the penalties of the law are inflicted , while the guilty contrivers the charterers , brokers , owners , and masters in short , all who are most deeply concerned in the crime and its rewards for the most part escape unpunished . It will be seen from the examinations which have recently taken place at Rio that the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty as well as our own citizens are deeply implicated in this inhuman traffic . British factors and agents , while they supply Africa with British fabrics in exchange for slaves , are chiefly instrumental in the abuse of the American flag and the suggestions contained in the letter of Wise whose judicious and zealous efforts in the matter can not be too highly commended , addressed to Hamilton , the British envoy , as to the best mode of suppressing the evil , deserve your most deliberate consideration , as they will receive , I doubt not , that of the British Government . It is also worthy of consideration whether any other measures than those now existing are necessary to give greater efficacy to the just and humane policy of our laws , which already provide for the restoration to Africa of slaves captured at sea by American cruisers . From time to time provision has been made by this Government for their comfortable support and maintenance during a limited period after their restoration , and it is much to be regretted that this liberal policy has not been adopted by Great Britain . As it is , it seems to me that the policy it has adopted is calculated rather to perpetuate than to suppress the trade by enlisting very large interests in its favor . Merchants and capitalists furnish the means of carrying it on manufactures , for which the Negroes are exchanged , are the products of her workshops the slaves , when captured , instead of being returned back to their homes are transferred to her colonial possessions in the West Indies and made the means of swelling the amount of their products by a system of apprenticeship for a term of years and the officers and crews who capture the vessels receive on the whole number of slaves so many pounds sterling per capita by way of bounty . It must be obvious that while these large interests are enlisted in favor of its continuance it will be difficult , if not impossible , to suppress the nefarious traffic , and that its results would be in effect but a continuance of the slave trade in another and more cruel form for it can be but a matter of little difference to the African whether he is torn from his country and transported to the West Indies as a slave in the regular course of the trade , or captured . by a cruiser , transferred to the same place , and made to perform the same labor under the name of an apprentice , which is at present the practical operation of the policy adopted . It is to be hoped that Her Britannic Majesty s Government will , upon a review of all the circumstances stated in these dispatches , adopt more efficient measures for the suppression of the trade , which she has so long attempted to put down , with , as yet , so little success , and more consonant with the original policy of restoring the captured African to his home .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Notwithstanding the urgency with which I have on more than one occasion felt it my duty to press upon Congress the necessity of providing the Government with the means of discharging its debts and maintaining inviolate the public faith , the increasing embarrassments of the Treasury impose upon me the indispensable obligation of again inviting your most serious attention to the condition of the finances . Fortunately for myself in thus bringing this important subject to your view for a deliberate and comprehensive examination in all its bearings , and I trust I may add for a final adjustment of it to the common advantage of the whole Union , I am permitted to approach it with perfect freedom and candor . As few of the burdens for which provision is now required to be made have been brought upon the country during my short administration of its affairs , I have neither motive nor wish to make them a matter of crimination against any of my predecessors . I am disposed to regard , as I am bound to treat , them as facts which can not now be undone , and as deeply interesting to us all , and equally imposing upon all the most solemn duties and the only use I would make of the errors of the past is by a careful examination of their causes and character to avoid if possible the repetition of them in future . The condition of the country , indeed , is such as may well arrest the conflict of parties . The conviction seems at length to have made its way to the minds of all that the disproportion between the public responsibilities and the means provided for meeting them is no casual nor transient evil . It is , on the contrary , one which for some years to come , notwithstanding a resort to all reasonable retrenchments and the constant progress of the country in population and productive power , must continue to increase under existing laws , unless we consent to give up or impair all our defenses in war and peace . But this is a thought which I am persuaded no patriotic mind would for a moment entertain . Without affecting an alarm , which I do not feel , in regard to our foreign relations , it may safely be affirmed that they are in a state too critical and involve too many momentous issues to permit us to neglect in the least , much less to abandon entirely , those means of asserting our rights without which negotiation is without dignity and peace without security . In the report of the Secretary of the Treasury submitted to Congress at the commencement of the present session it is estimated that after exhausting all the probable resources of the year there will remain a deficit of about 14 , 000 , 000 . With a view partly to a permanent system of revenue and partly to immediate relief from actual embarrassment , that officer recommended , together with a plan for establishing a Government exchequer , some expedients of a more temporary character , viz , the issuing of Treasury notes and the extension of the time for which the loan authorized to be negotiated by the act of the last session should be taken . Congress accordingly provided for an issue of Treasury notes to the amount of 5 , 000 , 000 , but subject to the condition that they should not be paid away below par . No measure connected with the last of the two objects above mentioned was introduced until recently into the House of Representatives . Should the loan bill now pending before that body pass into a law for its present amount , there would still remain a deficit of 2 , 500 , 000 . It requires no argument to show that such a condition of the Treasury is incompatible not only with a high state of public credit , but with anything approaching to efficiency in the conduct of public affairs . It must be obvious even to the most inexperienced minds that , to say nothing of any particular exigency , actual or imminent , there should be at all times in the Treasury of a great nation , with a view to contingencies of ordinary occurrence , a surplus at least equal in amount to the above deficiency . But that deficiency , serious as it would be in itself , will , I am compelled to say , rather be increased than diminished without the adoption of measures adequate to correct the evil at once . The stagnation of trade and business , in some degree incident to the derangement of the national finances and the state of the revenue laws , holds out but little prospect of relief , in the ordinary course of things , for some time to come . Under such circumstances I am deeply impressed with the necessity of meeting the crisis with a vigor and decision which it imperatively demands at the hands of all intrusted with the conduct of public affairs , The gravity of the evil calls for a remedy proportioned to it . No slight palliatives or occasional expedients will give the country the relief it needs . Such measures , on the contrary , will in the end , as is now manifest to all , too surely multiply its embarrassments . Relying , as I am bound to do , on the representatives of a people rendered illustrious among nations by having paid off its whole public debt , I shall not shrink from the responsibility imposed upon me by the Constitution of pointing out such measures as will in my opinion insure adequate relief . I am the more encouraged to recommend the course which necessity exacts by the confidence which I have in its complete success . The resources of the country in everything that constitutes the wealth and strength of nations are so abundant , the spirit of a most industrious , enterprising , and intelligent people is so energetic and elastic , that the Government will be without the shadow of excuse for its delinquency if the difficulties which now embarrass it be not speedily and effectually removed . From present indications it is hardly doubtful that Congress will find it necessary to lay additional duties on imports in order to meet the ordinary current expenses of the Government . In the exercise of a sound discrimination having reference to revenue , but at the same time necessarily affording incidental protection to manufacturing industry , it seems equally probable that duties on some articles of importation will have to be advanced above 20 per cent . In performing this important work of revising the tariff of duties , which in the present emergency would seem to be indispensable , I can not too strongly recommend the cultivation of a spirit of mutual harmony and concession , to which the Government itself owes its origin , and without the continued exercise of which jarring and discord would universally prevail . An additional reason for the increase of duties in some instances beyond the rate of 20 per cent will exist in fulfilling the recommendations already made , and now repeated , of making adequate appropriations for the defenses of the country . By the express provision of the act distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands among the States its operation is ipso facto to cease so soon as the rate of the duties shall exceed the limits prescribed in the act . In recommending the adoption of measures for distributing the proceeds of the public lands among the States at the commencement of the last session of Congress such distribution was urged by arguments and considerations which appeared to me then and appear to me now of great weight , and was placed on the condition that it should not render necessary any departure from the act of 1833 . It is with sincere regret that I now perceive the necessity of departing from that act , because I am well aware that expectations justly entertained by some of the States will be disappointed by any occasion which shall withhold from them the proceeds of the lands . But the condition was plainly expressed in the message and was inserted in terms equally plain in the law itself , and amidst the embarrassments which surround the country on all sides and beset both the General and the State Governments it appears to me that the object first and highest in importance is to establish the credit of this Government and to place it on durable foundations , and thus afford the most effectual support to the credit of the States , equal at least to what it would receive from a direct distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands . When the distribution law was passed there was reason to anticipate that there soon would be a real surplus to distribute . On that assumption it was in my opinion a wise , a just , and a beneficent measure . But to continue it in force while there is no such surplus to distribute and when it is manifestly necessary not only to increase the duties , but at the same time to borrow money in order to liquidate the public debt and disembarrass the public Treasury , would cause it to be regarded as an unwise alienation of the best security of the public creditor , which would with difficulty be excused and could not be justified . Causes of no ordinary character have recently depressed American credit in the stock market of the world to a degree quite unprecedented . I need scarcely mention the condition of the banking institutions of some of the States , the vast amount of foreign debt contracted during a period of wild speculation by corporations and individuals , and , above all , the doctrine of repudiation of contracts solemnly entered into by States , which , although as yet applied only under circumstances of a peculiar character and generally rebuked with severity by the moral sense of the community , is yet so very licentious and , in a Government depending wholly on opinion , so very alarming that the impression made by it to our disadvantage as a people is anything but surprising . Under such circumstances it is imperatively due from us to the people whom we represent that when we go into the money market to contract a loan we should tender such securities as to cause the money lender , as well at home as abroad , to feel that the most propitious opportunity is afforded him of investing profitably and judiciously his capital . A government which has paid off the debts of two wars , waged with the most powerful nation of modern times , should not be brought to the necessity of chaffering for terms in the money market . Under such circumstances as I have adverted to our object should be to produce with the capitalist a feeling of entire confidence , by a tender of that sort of security which in all times past has been esteemed sufficient , and which for the small amount of our proposed indebtedness will unhesitatingly be regarded as amply adequate . While a pledge of all the revenues amounts to no more than is implied in every instance when the Government contracts a debt , and although it ought in ordinary circumstances to be entirely satisfactory , yet in times like these the capitalist would feel better satisfied with the pledge of a specific fund , ample in magnitude to the payment of his interest and ultimate reimbursement of his principal . Such is the character of the land fund . The most vigilant money dealer will readily perceive that not only will his interest be secure on such a pledge , but that a debt of 18 , 000 , 000 or 20 , 000 , 000 would by the surplus of sales over and above the payment of the interest be extinguished within any reasonable time fixed for its redemption . To relieve the Treasury from its embarrassments and to aid in meeting its requisitions until time is allowed for any new tariff of duties to become available , it would seem to be necessary to fund a debt approaching to 15 , 000 , 000 and in order to place the negotiation of the loan beyond a reasonable doubt I submit to Congress whether the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should not be pledged for the payment of the interest , and the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized out of the surplus of the proceeds of such sales to purchase the stock , when it can be procured on such terms as will render it beneficial in that way , to extinguish the debt and prevent the accumulation of such surplus while its distribution is suspended . No one can doubt that were the Federal Treasury now as prosperous as it was ten years ago and its fiscal operations conducted by an efficient agency of its own , coextensive with the Union , the embarrassments of the States and corporations in them would produce , even if they continued as they are were that possible , effects far less disastrous than those now experienced . It is the disorder here , at the heart and center of the system , that paralyzes and deranges every part of it . Who does not know the permanent importance , not to the Federal Government alone , but to every State and every individual within its jurisdiction , even in their most independent and isolated individual pursuits , of the preservation of a sound state of public opinion and a judicious administration here The sympathy is instantaneous and universal . To attempt to remedy the evil of the deranged credit and currency of the States while the disease is allowed to rage in the vitals of this Government would be a hopeless undertaking . It is the full conviction of this truth which emboldens me most earnestly to recommend to your early and serious consideration the measures now submitted to your better judgment , as well as those to which your attention has been already invited . The first great want of the country , that without answering which all attempts at bettering the present condition of things will prove fruitless , is a complete restoration of the credit and finances of the Federal Government . The source and foundation of all credit is in the confidence which the Government inspires , and just in proportion as that confidence shall be shaken or diminished will be the distrust among all classes of the community and the derangement and demoralization in every branch of business and all the interests of the country . Keep up the standard of good faith and punctuality in the operations of the General Government , and all partial irregularities and disorders will be rectified by the influence of its example but suffer that standard to be debased or disturbed , and it is impossible to foresee to what a degree of degradation and confusion all financial interests , public and private , may sink . In such a country as this the representatives of the people have only to will it and the public credit will be as high as it ever was . My own views of the measures calculated to effect this great and desirable object I have thus frankly expressed to Congress under circumstances which give to the entire subject a peculiar and solemn interest . The Executive can do no more . If the credit of the country be exposed to question , if the public defenses be broken down or weakened , if the whole administration of public affairs be embarrassed for want of the necessary means for conducting them with vigor and effect , I trust that this department of the Government will be found to have done all that was in its power to avert such evils , and will be acquitted of all just blame on account of them .<speech_sep>
