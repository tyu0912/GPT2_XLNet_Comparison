Good evening . As most of you know , I have just returned from meetings in Iceland with the leader of the Soviet Union , General Secretary Gorbachev . As I did last year when I returned from the summit conference in Geneva , I want to take a few moments tonight to share with you what took place in these discussions . The implications of these talks are enormous and only just beginning to be understood . We proposed the most sweeping and generous arms control proposal in history . We offered the complete elimination of all ballistic missiles Soviet and American from the face of the Earth by 1996 . While we parted company with this American offer still on the table , we are closer than ever before to agreements that could lead to a safer world without nuclear weapons . But first , let me tell you that from the start of my meetings with Gorbachev , I have always regarded you , the American people , as full participants . Believe me , without your support none of these talks could have been held , nor could the ultimate aims of American foreign policy world peace and freedom be pursued . And it is for these aims I went the extra mile to Iceland . Before I report on our talks , though , allow me to set the stage by explaining two things that were very much a part of our talks one a treaty and the other a defense against nuclear missiles , which we are trying to develop . Now , you have heard their titles a thousand times the ABM treaty and SDWell those letters stand for ABantiballistic missile SDStrategic Defense Initiative . Some years ago , the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to limit any defense against nuclear missile attacks to the emplacement in one location in each country of a small number of missiles capable of intercepting and shooting down incoming nuclear missiles , thus leaving our real defense a policy called mutual assured destruction , meaning if one side launched a nuclear attack , the other side could retaliate . And this mutual threat of destruction was believed to be a deterrent against either side striking first . So here we sit , with thousands of nuclear warheads targeted on each other and capable of wiping out both our countries . The Soviets deployed the few antiballistic missiles around Moscow as the treaty permitted . Our country did not bother deploying because the threat of nationwide annihilation made such a limited defense seem useless . For some years now we have been aware that the Soviets may be developing a nationwide defense . They have installed a large , modern radar at Krasnoyarsk , which we believe is a critical part of a radar system designed to provide radar guidance for antiballistic missiles protecting the entire nation . Now , this is a violation of the ABM treaty . Believing that a policy of mutual destruction and slaughter of their citizens and ours was uncivilized , I asked our military , a few years ago , to study and see if there was a practical way to destroy nuclear missiles after their launch but before they can reach their targets , rather than to just destroy people . Well , this is the goal for what we call SDand our scientists researching such a system are convinced it is practical and that several years down the road we can have such a system ready to deploy . Now incidentally , we are not violating the ABM treaty , which permits such research . If and when we deploy the treaty also allows withdrawal from the treaty upon 6 months notice . SDlet me make it clear , is a nonnuclear defense . So , here we are at Iceland for our second such meeting . In the first , and in the months in between , we have discussed ways to reduce and in fact eliminate nuclear weapons entirely . We and the Soviets have had teams of negotiators in Geneva trying to work out a mutual agreement on how we could reduce or eliminate nuclear weapons . And so far , no success . On Saturday and Sunday , General Secretary Gorbachev and his foreign minister , Shevardnadze , and Secretary of State George Shultz and I met for nearly 10 hours . We did not limit ourselves to just arms reductions . We discussed what we call violation of human rights on the part of the Soviets refusal to let people emigrate from Russia so they can practice their religion without being persecuted , letting people go to rejoin their families , husbands , and wives separated by national borders being allowed to reunite . In much of this , the Soviet Union is violating another agreement the Helsinki accords they had signed in 1975 . Yuriy Orlov , whose freedom we just obtained , was imprisoned for pointing out to his government its violations of that pact , its refusal to let citizens leave their country or return . We also discussed regional matters such as Afghanistan , Angola , Nicaragua , and Cambodia . But by their choice , the main subject was arms control . We discussed the emplacement of intermediate range missiles in Europe and Asia and seemed to be in agreement they could be drastically reduced . Both sides seemed willing to find a way to reduce , even to zero , the strategic ballistic missiles we have aimed at each other . This then brought up the subject of SDI . I offered a proposal that we continue our present research . And if and when we reached the stage of testing , we would sign , now , a treaty that would permit Soviet observation of such tests . And if the program was practical , we would both eliminate our offensive missiles , and then we would share the benefits of advanced defenses . I explained that even though we would have done away with our offensive ballistic missiles , having the defense would protect against cheating or the possibility of a madman , sometime , deciding to create nuclear missiles . After all , the world now knows how to make them . I likened it to our keeping our gas masks , even though the nations of the world had outlawed poison gas after World War We seemed to be making progress on reducing weaponry , although the General Secretary was registering opposition to SDI and proposing a pledge to observe ABM for a number of years as the day was ending . Secretary Shultz suggested we turn over the notes our note takers had been making of everything we had said to our respective teams and let them work through the night to put them together and find just where we were in agreement and what differences separated us . With respect and gratitude , I can inform you those teams worked through the night till 6 30 a . m . Yesterday , Sunday morning , Gorbachev and with our foreign ministers , came together again and took up the report of our two teams . It was most promising . The Soviets had asked for a 10 year delay in the deployment of SDI programs . In an effort to see how we could satisfy their concerns while protecting our principles and security we proposed a 10 year period in which we began with the reduction of all strategic nuclear arms , bombers , airlaunched cruise missiles , intercontinental ballistic missiles , submarine launched ballistic missiles and the weapons they carry . They would be reduced 50 percent in the first five years . During the next five years , we would continue by eliminating all remaining offensive ballistic missiles , of all ranges . And during that time , we would proceed with research , development , and testing of SDI all done in conformity with ABM provisions . At the 10 year point , with all ballistic missiles eliminated , we could proceed to deploy advanced defenses , at the same time permitting the Soviets to do likewise . And here the debate began . The General Secretary wanted wording that , in effect , would have kept us from developing the SDI for the entire 10 years . In effect , he was killing SDAnd unless I agreed , all that work toward eliminating nuclear weapons would go down the drain canceled . I told him I had pledged to the American people that I would not trade away SDthere was no way I could tell our people their government would not protect them against nuclear destruction . I went to Reykjavik determined that everything was negotiable except two things our freedom and our future . I am still optimistic that a way will be found . The door is open , and the opportunity to begin eliminating the nuclear threat is within reach . So you can see , we made progress in Iceland . And we will continue to make progress if we pursue a prudent , deliberate , and above all , realistic approach with the Soviets . From the earliest days of our administration this has been our policy . We made it clear we had no illusions about the Soviets or their ultimate intentions . We were publicly candid about the critical , moral distinctions between totalitarianism and democracy . We declared the principal objective of American foreign policy to be not just the prevention of war , but the extension of freedom . And we stressed our commitment to the growth of democratic government and democratic institutions around the world . And that is why we assisted freedom fighters who are resisting the imposition of totalitarian rule in Afghanistan , Nicaragua , Angola , Cambodia , and elsewhere . And finally , we began work on what I believe most spurred the Soviets to negotiate seriously rebuilding our military strength , reconstructing our strategic deterrence , and above all , beginning work on the Strategic Defense Initiative . And yet , at the same time , we set out these foreign policy goals and began working toward them . We pursued another of our major objectives that of seeking means to lessen tensions with the Soviets and ways to prevent war and keep the peace . Now , this policy is now paying dividends one sign of this in Iceland was the progress on the issue of arms control . For the first time in a long while , Soviet American negotiations in the area of arms reductions are moving , and moving in the right direction not just toward arms control , but toward arms reduction . But for all the progress we made on arms reductions , we must remember there were other issues on the table in Iceland , issues that are fundamental . As I mentioned , one such issue is human rights . As President Kennedy once said , And is not peace , in the last analysis , basically a matter of human rights I made it plain that the United States would not seek to exploit improvement in these matters for purposes of propaganda . But I also made it plain , once again , that an improvement of the human condition within the Soviet Union is indispensable for an improvement in bilateral relations with the United States . For a government that will break faith with its own people cannot be trusted to keep faith with foreign powers . So , I told Gorbachev again in Reykjavik , as I had in Geneva we Americans place far less weight upon the words that are spoken at meetings such as these than upon the deeds that follow . When it comes to human rights and judging Soviet intentions , we are all from Missouri you got to show us . Another subject area we took up in Iceland also lies at the heart of the differences between the Soviet Union and America . This is the issue of regional conflicts . Summit meetings cannot make the American people forget what Soviet actions have meant for the peoples of Afghanistan , Central America , Africa , and Southeast Asia . Until Soviet policies change , we will make sure that our friends in these areas those who fight for freedom and independence will have the support they need . Finally , there was a fourth item . And this area was that of bilateral relations , people to people contacts . In Geneva last year , we welcomed several cultural exchange accords in Iceland , we saw indications of more movement in these areas . But let me say now The United States remains committed to people to people programs that could lead to exchanges between not just a few elite , but thousands of everyday citizens from both our countries . So , I think , then , that you can see that we did make progress in Iceland on a broad range of topics . We reaffirmed our fourpoint agenda . We discovered major new grounds of agreement . We probed again some old areas of disagreement . And let me return again to the SDI issue . I realize some Americans may be asking tonight Why not accept Gorbachev s demand Why not give up SDI for this agreement Well , the answer , my friends , is simple . SDI is America s insurance policy that the Soviet Union would keep the commitments made at Reykjavik . SDI is America s security guarantee if the Soviets should as they have done too often in the past fail to comply with their solemn commitments . SDI is what brought the Soviets back to arms control talks at Geneva and Iceland . SDI is the key to a world without nuclear weapons . The Soviets understand this . They have devoted far more resources , for a lot longer time than we , to their own SDThe world s only operational missile defense today surrounds Moscow , the capital of the Soviet Union . What Gorbachev was demanding at Reykjavik was that the United States agree to a new version of a 14 year old ABM treaty that the Soviet Union has already violated . I told him we do not make those kinds of deals in the United States . And the American people should reflect on these critical questions How does a defense of the United States threaten the Soviet Union or anyone else Why are the Soviets so adamant that America remain forever vulnerable to Soviet rocket attack As of today , all free nations are utterly defenseless against Soviet missiles fired either by accident or design . Why does the Soviet Union insist that we remain so forever So , my fellow Americans , I cannot promise , nor can any President promise , that the talks in Iceland or any future discussions with Gorbachev will lead inevitably to great breakthroughs or momentous treaty signings . We will not abandon the guiding principle we took to Reykjavik . We prefer no agreement than to bring home a bad agreement to the United States . And on this point , I know you are also interested in the question of whether there will be another summit . There was no indication by Gorbachev as to when or whether he plans to travel to the United States , as we agreed he would last year in Geneva . I repeat tonight that our invitation stands , and that we continue to believe additional meetings would be useful . But that is a decision the Soviets must make . But whatever the immediate prospects , I can tell you that I am ultimately hopeful about the prospects for progress at the summit and for world peace and freedom . You see , the current summit process is very different from that of previous decades . It is different because the world is different and the world is different because of the hard work and sacrifice of the American people during the past five and a half years . Your energy has restored and expanded our economic might . Your support has restored our military strength . Your courage and sense of national unity in times of crisis have given pause to our adversaries , heartened our friends , and inspired the world . The Western democracies and the NATO alliance are revitalized and all across the world , nations are turning to democratic ideas and the principles of the free market . So , because the American people stood guard at the critical hour , freedom has gathered its forces , regained its strength , and is on the march . So , if there is one impression I carry away with me from these October talks , it is that , unlike the past , we are dealing now from a position of strength . And for that reason , we have it within our grasp to move speedily with the Soviets toward even more breakthroughs . Our ideas are out there on the table . They will not go away . We are ready to pick up where we left off . Our negotiators are heading back to Geneva , and we are prepared to go forward whenever and wherever the Soviets are ready . So , there is reason , good reason for hope . I saw evidence of this is in the progress we made in the talks with Gorbachev . And I saw evidence of it when we left Iceland yesterday , and I spoke to our young men and women at our naval installation at Keflavik a critically important base far closer to Soviet naval bases than to our own coastline . As always , I was proud to spend a few moments with them and thank them for their sacrifices and devotion to country . They represent America at her finest committed to defend not only our own freedom but the freedom of others who would be living in a far more frightening world were it not for the strength and resolve of the United States . Whenever the standard of freedom and independence has been . . . unfurled , there will be America s heart , her benedictions , and her prayers , John Quincy Adams once said . He spoke well of our destiny as a nation . My fellow Americans , we are honored by history , entrusted by destiny with the oldest dream of humanity the dream of lasting peace and human freedom . Another President , Harry Truman , noted that our century had seen two of the most frightful wars in history and that the supreme need of our time is for man to learn to live together in peace and harmony . It is in pursuit of that ideal I went to Geneva a year ago and to Iceland last week . And it is in pursuit of that ideal that I thank you now for all the support you have given me , and I again ask for your help and your prayers as we continue our journey toward a world where peace reigns and freedom is enshrined . Thank you , and God bless you .<speech_sep>This morning at 7 a . m . the union representing those who man America s air traffic control facilities called a strike . This was the culmination of 7 months of negotiations between the Federal Aviation Administration and the union . At one point in these negotiations agreement was reached and signed by both sides , granting a 40 million increase in salaries and benefits . This is twice what other government employees can expect . It was granted in recognition of the difficulties inherent in the work these people perform . Now , however , the union demands are 17 times what had been agreed to 681 million . This would impose a tax burden on their fellow citizens which is unacceptable . I would like to thank the supervisors and controllers who are on the job today , helping to get the nation s air system operating safely . In the New York area , for example , four supervisors were scheduled to report for work , and 17 additionally volunteered . At National Airport a traffic controller told a newsperson he had resigned from the union and reported to work because , How can I ask my kids to obey the law if I do not This is a great tribute to America . Let me make one thing plain . I respect the right of workers in the private sector to strike . Indeed , as president of my own union , I led the first strike ever called by that union . I guess I am maybe the first one to ever hold this office who is a lifetime member of an AFL CIO union . But we cannot compare labor management relations in the private sector with government . Government cannot close down the assembly line . It has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government s reason for being . It was in recognition of this that the Congress passed a law forbidding strikes by government employees against the public safety . Let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees , a sworn affidavit , when they accepted their jobs I am not participating in any strike against the Government of the United States or any agency thereof , and I will not so participate while an employee of the Government of the United States or any agency thereof . It is for this reason that I must tell those who fail to report for duty this morning they are in violation of the law , and if they do not report for work within 48 hours , they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated . Well , I have some people around here , and maybe I should refer that question to the Attorney General . I told you what I think should be done . They are terminated . If any situation should arise that would require my presence here , naturally I will do that . So , that will be a decision that awaits what is going to happen . May I just because I have to be back in there for another appointment may I just say one thing on top of this With all this talk of penalties and everything else , I hope that you will emphasize , again , the possibility of termination , because I believe that there are a great many of those people and they are fine people who have been swept up in this and probably have not really considered the result the fact that they had taken an oath , the fact that this is now in violation of the law , as that one supervisor referred to with regard to his children . And I am hoping that they will in a sense remove themselves from the lawbreaker situation by returning to their posts . I have no way to know whether this had been conveyed to them by their union leaders , who had been informed that this would be the result of a strike . Forty eight hours . What lesser action can there be The law is very explicit . They are violating the law . And as I say , we called this to the attention of their leadership . Whether this was conveyed to the membership before they voted to strike , I do not know . But this is one of the reasons why there can be no further negotiation while this situation continues . You cannot sit and negotiate with a union that is in violation of the law . And their oath . Well , that again is not for me to answer . As far as the military personnel are concerned , they are going to fundamentally be backup to the supervisory personnel . We had 150 on the job , supposedly , about a half hour ago . We are going to increase that to somewhere between 700 and 850 .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans , thank you for sharing your time with me tonight . The subject I want to discuss with you , peace and national security , is both timely and important . Timely , because I have reached a decision which offers a new hope for our children in the 21st century , a decision I will tell you about in a few minutes . And important because there is a very big decision that you must make for yourselves . This subject involves the most basic duty that any President and any people share , the duty to protect and strengthen the peace . At the beginning of this year , I submitted to the Congress a defense budget which reflects my best judgment of the best understanding of the experts and specialists who advise me about what we and our allies must do to protect our people in the years ahead . That budget is much more than a long list of numbers , for behind all the numbers lies America s ability to prevent the greatest of human tragedies and preserve our free way of life in a sometimes dangerous world . It is part of a careful , long term plan to make America strong again after too many years of neglect and mistakes . Our efforts to rebuild America s defenses and strengthen the peace began 2 years ago when we requested a major increase in the defense program . Since then , the amount of those increases we first proposed has been reduced by half , through improvements in management and procurement and other savings . The budget request that is now before the Congress has been trimmed to the limits of safety . Further deep cuts cannot be made without seriously endangering the security of the Nation . The choice is up to the men and women you have elected to the Congress , and that means the choice is up to you . Tonight , I want to explain to you what this defense debate is all about and why I am convinced that the budget now before the Congress is necessary , responsible , and deserving of your support . And I want to offer hope for the future . But first , let me say what the defense debate is not about . It is not about spending arithmetic . I know that in the last few weeks you have been bombarded with numbers and percentages . Some say we need only a 5 percent increase in defense spending . The so called alternate budget backed by liberals in the House of Representatives would lower the figure to 2 to 3 percent , cutting our defense spending by 163 billion over the next 5 years . The trouble with all these numbers is that they tell us little about the kind of defense program America needs or the benefits and security and freedom that our defense effort buys for us . What seems to have been lost in all this debate is the simple truth of how a defense budget is arrived at . It is not done by deciding to spend a certain number of dollars . Those loud voices that are occasionally heard charging that the Government is trying to solve a security problem by throwing money at it are nothing more than noise based on ignorance . We start by considering what must be done to maintain peace and review all the possible threats against our security . Then a strategy for strengthening peace and defending against those threats must be agreed upon . And , finally , our defense establishment must be evaluated to see what is necessary to protect against any or all of the potential threats . The cost of achieving these ends is totaled up , and the result is the budget for national defense . There is no logical way that you can say , let us spend x billion dollars less . You can only say , which part of our defense measures do we believe we can do without and still have security against all contingencies Anyone in the Congress who advocates a percentage or a specific dollar cut in defense spending should be made to say what part of our defenses he would eliminate , and he should be candid enough to acknowledge that his cuts mean cutting our commitments to allies or inviting greater risk or both . The defense policy of the United States is based on a simple premise The United States does not start fights . We will never be an aggressor . We maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression to preserve freedom and peace . Since the dawn of the atomic age , we have sought to reduce the risk of war by maintaining a strong deterrent and by seeking genuine arms control . Deterrence means simply this making sure any adversary who thinks about attacking the United States , or our allies , or our vital interests , concludes that the risks to him outweigh any potential gains . Once he understands that , he will not attack . We maintain the peace through our strength weakness only invites aggression . This strategy of deterrence has not changed . It still works . But what it takes to maintain deterrence has changed . It took one kind of military force to deter an attack when we had far more nuclear weapons than any other power it takes another kind now that the Soviets , for example , have enough accurate and powerful nuclear weapons to destroy virtually all of our missiles on the ground . Now , this is not to say that the Soviet Union is planning to make war on us . Nor do I believe a war is inevitable quite the contrary . But what must be recognized is that our security is based on being prepared to meet all threats . There was a time when we depended on coastal forts and artillery batteries , because , with the weaponry of that day , any attack would have had to come by sea . Well , this is a different world , and our defenses must be based on recognition and awareness of the weaponry possessed by other nations in the nuclear age . We cannot afford to believe that we will never be threatened . There have been two world wars in my lifetime . We did not start them and , indeed , did everything we could to avoid being drawn into them . But we were ill prepared for both . Had we been better prepared , peace might have been preserved . For 20 years the Soviet Union has been accumulating enormous military might . They did not stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability . And they have not stopped now . During the past decade and a half , the Soviets have built up a massive arsenal of new strategic nuclear weapons weapons that can strike directly at the United States . As an example , the United States introduced its last new intercontinental ballistic missile , the Minute Man IIin 1969 , and we are now dismantling our even older Titan missiles . But what has the Soviet Union done in these intervening years Well , since 1969 the Soviet Union has built five new classes of ICBM s , and upgraded these eight times . As a result , their missiles are much more powerful and accurate than they were several years ago , and they continue to develop more , while ours are increasingly obsolete . The same thing has happened in other areas . Over the same period , the Soviet Union built 4 new classes of submarine launched ballistic missiles and over 60 new missile submarines . We built 2 new types of submarine missiles and actually withdrew 10 submarines from strategic missions . The Soviet Union built over 200 new Backfire bombers , and their brand new Blackjack bomber is now under development . We have not built a new long range bomber since our B 52 s were deployed about a quarter of a century ago , and we have already retired several hundred of those because of old age . Indeed , despite what many people think , our strategic forces only cost about 15 percent of the defense budget . Another example of what is happened In 1978 the Soviets had 600 intermediate range nuclear missiles based on land and were beginning to add the SS 20 a new , highly accurate , mobile missile with 3 warheads . We had none . Since then the Soviets have strengthened their lead . By the end of 1979 , when Soviet leader Brezhnev declared a balance now exists , the Soviets had over 800 warheads . We still had none . A year ago this month , Brezhnev pledged a moratorium , or freeze , on SS 20 deployment . But by last August , their 800 warheads had become more than 1 , 200 . We still had none . Some freeze . At this time Soviet Defense Minister Ustinov announced approximate parity of forces continues to exist . But the Soviets are still adding an average of 3 new warheads a week , and now have 1 , 300 . These warheads can reach their targets in a matter of a few minutes . We still have none . So far , it seems that the Soviet definition of parity is a box score of 1 , 300 to nothing , in their favor . So , together with our NATO allies , we decided in 1979 to deploy new weapons , beginning this year , as a deterrent to their SS 20 s and as an incentive to the Soviet Union to meet us in serious arms control negotiations . We will begin that deployment late this year . At the same time , however , we are willing to cancel our program if the Soviets will dismantle theirs . This is what we have called a zero zero plan . The Soviets are now at the negotiating table and I think it is fair to say that without our planned deployments , they would not be there . Now , let us consider conventional forces . Since 1974 the United States has produced 3 , 050 tactical combat aircraft . By contrast , the Soviet Union has produced twice as many . When we look at attack submarines , the United States has produced 27 while the Soviet Union has produced 61 . For armored vehicles , including tanks , we have produced 11 , 200 . The Soviet Union has produced 54 , 000 nearly 5 to 1 in their favor . Finally , with artillery , we have produced 950 artillery and rocket launchers while the Soviets have produced more than 13 , 000 a staggering 14 to 1 ratio . There was a time when we were able to offset superior Soviet numbers with higher quality , but today they are building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own . As the Soviets have increased their military power , they have been emboldened to extend that power . They are spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies . The following aerial photographs , most of them secret until now , illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home Central America and the Caribbean Basin . They are not dramatic photographs . But I think they help give you a better understanding of what I am talking about . This Soviet intelligence collection facility , less than a hundred miles from our coast , is the largest of its kind in the world . The acres and acres of antennae fields and intelligence monitors are targeted on key military installations and sensitive activities . The installation in Lourdes , Cuba , is manned by 1 , 500 Soviet technicians . And the satellite ground station allows instant communications with Moscow . This 28 square mile facility has grown by more than 60 percent in size and capability during the past decade . In western Cuba , we see this military airfield and it complement of modern , Soviet built Mig 23 aircraft . The Soviet Union uses this Cuban airfield for its own long range reconnaissance missions . And earlier this month , two modern Soviet antisubmarine warfare aircraft began operating from it . During the past 2 years , the level of Soviet arms exports to Cuba can only be compared to the levels reached during the Cuban missile crisis 20 years ago . This third photo , which is the only one in this series that has been previously made public , shows Soviet military hardware that has made its way to Central America . This airfield with its MI 8 helicopters , anti aircraft guns , and protected fighter sites is one of a number of military facilities in Nicaragua which has received Soviet equipment funneled through Cuba , and reflects the massive military buildup going on in that country . On the small island of Grenada , at the southern end of the Caribbean chain , the Cubans , with Soviet financing and backing , are in the process of building an airfield with a 10 , 000 foot runway . Grenada does not even have an air force . Who is it intended for The Caribbean is a very important passageway for our international commerce and military lines of communication . More than half of all American oil imports now pass through the Caribbean . The rapid buildup of Grenada s military potential is unrelated to any conceivable threat to this island country of under 110 , 000 people and totally at odds with the pattern of other eastern Caribbean States , most of which are unarmed . The Soviet Cuban militarization of Grenada , in short , can only be seen as power projection into the region . And it is in this important economic and strategic area that we are trying to help the Governments of El Salvador , Costa Rica , Honduras , and others in their struggles for democracy against guerrillas supported through Cuba and Nicaragua . These pictures only tell a small part of the story . I wish I could show you more without compromising our most sensitive intelligence sources and methods . But the Soviet Union is also supporting Cuban military forces in Angola and Ethiopia . They have bases in Ethiopia and South Yemen , near the Persian Gulf oil fields . They have taken over the port that we built at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam . And now for the first time in history , the Soviet Navy is a force to be reckoned with in the South Pacific . Some people may still ask Would the Soviets ever use their formidable military power Well , again , can we afford to believe they will not There is Afghanistan . And in Poland , the Soviets denied the will of the people and in so doing demonstrated to the world how their military power could also be used to intimidate . The final fact is that the Soviet Union is acquiring what can only be considered an offensive military force . They have continued to build far more intercontinental ballistic missiles than they could possibly need simply to deter an attack . Their conventional forces are trained and equipped not so much to defend against an attack as they are to permit sudden , surprise offensives of their own . Our NATO allies have assumed a great defense burden , including the military draft in most countries . We are working with them and our other friends around the world to do more . Our defensive strategy means we need military forces that can move very quickly , forces that are trained and ready to respond to any emergency . Every item in our defense program our ships , our tanks , our planes , our funds for training and spare parts is intended for one all important purpose to keep the peace . Unfortunately , a decade of neglecting our military forces had called into question our ability to do that . When I took office in January 1981 , I was appalled by what I found American planes that could not fly and American ships that could not sail for lack of spare parts and trained personnel and insufficient fuel and ammunition for essential training . The inevitable result of all this was poor morale in our Armed Forces , difficulty in recruiting the brightest young Americans to wear the uniform , and difficulty in convincing our most experienced military personnel to stay on . There was a real question then about how well we could meet a crisis . And it was obvious that we had to begin a major modernization program to ensure we could deter aggression and preserve the peace in the years ahead . We had to move immediately to improve the basic readiness and staying power of our conventional forces , so they could meet and therefore help deter a crisis . We had to make up for lost years of investment by moving forward with a long term plan to prepare our forces to counter the military capabilities our adversaries were developing for the future . I know that all of you want peace , and so do I know too that many of you seriously believe that a nuclear freeze would further the cause of peace . But a freeze now would make us less , not more , secure and would raise , not reduce , the risks of war . It would be largely unverifiable and would seriously undercut our negotiations on arms reduction . It would reward the Soviets for their massive military buildup while preventing us from modernizing our aging and increasingly vulnerable forces . With their present margin of superiority , why should they agree to arms reductions knowing that we were prohibited from catching up Believe me , it was not pleasant for someone who had come to Washington determined to reduce government spending , but we had to move forward with the task of repairing our defenses or we would lose our ability to deter conflict now and in the future . We had to demonstrate to any adversary that aggression could not succeed , and that the only real solution was substantial , equitable , and effectively verifiable arms reduction the kind we are working for right now in Geneva . Thanks to your strong support , and bipartisan support from the Congress , we began to turn things around . Already , we are seeing some very encouraging results . Quality recruitment and retention are up dramatically more high school graduates are choosing military careers , and more experienced career personnel are choosing to stay . Our men and women in uniform at last are getting the tools and training they need to do their jobs . Ask around today , especially among our young people , and I think you will find a whole new attitude toward serving their country . This reflects more than just better pay , equipment , and leadership . You the American people have sent a signal to these young people that it is once again an honor to wear the uniform . That is not something you measure in a budget , but it is a very real part of our nation s strength . It will take us longer to build the kind of equipment we need to keep peace in the future , but we have made a good start . We have not built a new long range bomber for 21 years . Now we are building the B 1 . We had not launched one new strategic submarine for 17 years . Now we are building one Trident submarine a year . Our land based missiles are increasingly threatened by the many huge , new Soviet ICBM s . We are determining how to solve that problem . At the same time , we are working in the START and INF negotiations with the goal of achieving deep reductions in the strategic and intermediate nuclear arsenals of both sides . We have also begun the long needed modernization of our conventional forces . The Army is getting its first new tank in 20 years . The Air Force is modernizing . We are rebuilding our Navy , which shrank from about a thousand ships in the late 1960 s to 453 during the 1970 s . Our nation needs a superior navy to support our military forces and vital interests overseas . We are now on the road to achieving a 600 ship navy and increasing the amphibious capabilities of our marines , who are now serving the cause of peace in Lebanon . And we are building a real capability to assist our friends in the vitally important Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf region . This adds up to a major effort , and it is not cheap . It comes at a time when there are many other pressures on our budget and when the American people have already had to make major sacrifices during the recession . But we must not be misled by those who would make defense once again the scapegoat of the Federal budget . The fact is that in the past few decades we have seen a dramatic shift in how we spend the taxpayer s dollar . Back in 1955 , payments to individuals took up only about 20 percent of the Federal budget . For nearly three decades , these payments steadily increased and , this year , will account for 49 percent of the budget . By contrast , in 1955 defense took up more than half of the Federal budget . By 1980 this spending had fallen to a low of 23 percent . Even with the increase that I am requesting this year , defense will still amount to only 28 percent of the budget . The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice , simple arithmetic . They are the same kind of talk that led the democracies to neglect their defenses in the 1930 s and invited the tragedy of World War IWe must not let that grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or neglect . This is why I am speaking to you tonight to urge you to tell your Senators and Congressmen that you know we must continue to restore our military strength . If we stop in midstream , we will send a signal of decline , of lessened will , to friends and adversaries alike . Free people must voluntarily , through open debate and democratic means , meet the challenge that totalitarians pose by compulsion . It is up to us , in our time , to choose and choose wisely between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day . The solution is well within our grasp . But to reach it , there is simply no alternative but to continue this year , in this budget , to provide the resources we need to preserve the peace and guarantee our freedom . Now , thus far tonight I have shared with you my thoughts on the problems of national security we must face together . My predecessors in the Oval Office have appeared before you on other occasions to describe the threat posed by Soviet power and have proposed steps to address that threat . But since the advent of nuclear weapons , those steps have been increasingly directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise of retaliation . This approach to stability through offensive threat has worked . We and our allies have succeeded in preventing nuclear war for more than three decades . In recent months , however , my advisers , including in particular the Joint Chiefs of Staff , have underscored the necessity to break out of a future that relies solely on offensive retaliation for our security . Over the course of these discussions , I have become more and more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings by threatening their existence . Feeling this way , I believe we must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reducing tensions and for introducing greater stability into the strategic calculus on both sides . One of the most important contributions we can make is , of course , to lower the level of all arms , and particularly nuclear arms . We are engaged right now in several negotiations with the Soviet Union to bring about a mutual reduction of weapons . I will report to you a week from tomorrow my thoughts on that score . But let me just say , I am totally committed to this course . If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to achieve major arms reduction , we will have succeeded in stabilizing the nuclear balance . Nevertheless , it will still be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation , on mutual threat . And that is a sad commentary on the human condition . Would not it be better to save lives than to avenge them Are we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a truly lasting stability I think we are . Indeed , we must . After careful consultation with my advisers , including the Joint Chiefs of Staff , I believe there is a way . Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope . It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive . Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today . What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant retaliation to deter a Soviet attack , that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies I know this is a formidable , technical task , one that may not be accomplished before the end of this century . Yet , current technology has attained a level of sophistication where it is reasonable for us to begin this effort . It will take years , probably decades of effort on many fronts . There will be failures and setbacks , just as there will be successes and breakthroughs . And as we proceed , we must remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible response . But is not it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war We know it is . In the meantime , we will continue to pursue real reductions in nuclear arms , negotiating from a position of strength that can be ensured only by modernizing our strategic forces . At the same time , we must take steps to reduce the risk of a conventional military conflict escalating to nuclear war by improving our nonnuclear capabilities . America does possess now the technologies to attain very significant improvements in the effectiveness of our conventional , nonnuclear forces . Proceeding boldly with these new technologies , we can significantly reduce any incentive that the Soviet Union may have to threaten attack against the United States or its allies . As we pursue our goal of defensive technologies , we recognize that our allies rely upon our strategic offensive power to deter attacks against them . Their vital interests and ours are inextricably linked . Their safety and ours are one . And no change in technology can or will alter that reality . We must and shall continue to honor our commitments . I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations and raise certain problems and ambiguities . If paired with offensive systems , they can be viewed as fostering an aggressive policy , and no one wants that . But with these considerations firmly in mind , I call upon the scientific community in our country , those who gave us nuclear weapons , to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace , to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete . Tonight , consistent with our obligations of the ABM treaty and recognizing the need for closer consultation with our allies , I am taking an important first step . I am directing a comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long term research and development program to begin to achieve our ultimate goal of eliminating the threat posed by strategic nuclear missiles . This could pave the way for arms control measures to eliminate the weapons themselves . We seek neither military superiority nor political advantage . Our only purpose one all people share is to search for ways to reduce the danger of nuclear war . My fellow Americans , tonight we are launching an effort which holds the promise of changing the course of human history . There will be risks , and results take time . But I believe we can do it . As we cross this threshold , I ask for your prayers and your support . Thank you , good night , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Chairman , Vice President to be , this convention , my fellow citizens of this great nation With a deep awareness of the responsibility conferred by your trust , I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States . I do so with deep gratitude , and I think also I might interject on behalf of all of us , our thanks to Detroit and the people of Michigan and to this city for the warm hospitality they have shown . And I thank you for your wholehearted response to my recommendation in regard to George Bush as a candidate for vice president . I am very proud of our party tonight . This convention has shown to all America a party united , with positive programs for solving the nation s problems a party ready to build a new consensus with all those across the land who share a community of values embodied in these words family , work , neighborhood , peace and freedom . I know we have had a quarrel or two , but only as to the method of attaining a goal . There was no argument about the goal . As president , I will establish a liaison with the 50 governors to encourage them to eliminate , where it exists , discrimination against women . I will monitor federal laws to insure their implementation and to add statutes if they are needed . More than anything else , I want my candidacy to unify our country to renew the American spirit and sense of purpose . I want to carry our message to every American , regardless of party affiliation , who is a member of this community of shared values . Never before in our history have Americans been called upon to face three grave threats to our very existence , any one of which could destroy us . We face a disintegrating economy , a weakened defense and an energy policy based on the sharing of scarcity . The major issue of this campaign is the direct political , personal and moral responsibility of Democratic Party leadership i n the White House and in Congress for this unprecedented calamity which has befallen us . They tell us they have done the most that humanly could be done . They say that the United States has had its day in the sun that our nation has passed its zenith . They expect you to tell your children that the American people no longer have the will to cope with their problems that the future will be one of sacrifice and few opportunities . My fellow citizens , I utterly reject that view . The American people , the most generous on earth , who created the highest standard of living , are not going to accept the notion that we can only make a better world for others by moving backwards ourselves . Those who believe we can have no business leading the nation . I will not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself under mediocre leadership that drifts from one crisis to the next , eroding our national will and purpose . We have come together here because the American people deserve better from those to whom they entrust our nation s highest offices , and we stand united in our resolve to do something about it . We need rebirth of the American tradition of leadership at every level of government and in private life as well . The United States of America is unique in world history because it has a genius for leaders many leaders on many levels . But , back in 1976 , Carter said , Trust me . And a lot of people did . Now , many of those people are out of work . Many have seen their savings eaten away by inflation . Many others on fixed incomes , especially the elderly , have watched helplessly as the cruel tax of inflation wasted away their purchasing power . And , today , a great many who trusted Carter wonder if we can survive the Carter policies of national defense . Trust me government asks that we concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man that we trust him to do what is best for us . My view of government places trust not in one person or one party , but in those values that transcend persons and parties . The trust is where it belongs in the people . The responsibility to live up to that trust is where it belongs , in their elected leaders . That kind of relationship , between the people and their elected leaders , is a special kind of compact . Three hundred and sixty years ago , in 1620 , a group of families dared to cross a mighty ocean to build a future for themselves in a new world . When they arrived at Plymouth , Massachusetts , they formed what they called a compact an agreement among themselves to build a community and abide by its laws . The single act the voluntary binding together of free people to live under the law set the pattern for what was to come . A century and a half later , the descendants of those people pledged their lives , their fortunes and their sacred honor to found this nation . Some forfeited their fortunes and their lives none sacrificed honor . Four score and seven years later , Abraham Lincoln called upon the people of all America to renew their dedication and their commitment to a government of , for and by the people . Is not it once again time to renew our compact of freedom to pledge to each other all that is best in our lives all that gives meaning to them for the sake of this , our beloved and blessed land Together , let us make this a new beginning . Let us make a commitment to care for the needy to teach our children the values and the virtues handed down to us by our families to have the courage to defend those values and the willingness to sacrifice for them . Let us pledge to restore , in our time , the American spirit of voluntary service , of cooperation , of private and community initiative a spirit that flows like a deep and mighty river through the history of our nation . As your nominee , I pledge to restore to the federal government the capacity to do the people s work without dominating their lives . I pledge to you a government that will not only work well , but wisely its ability to act tempered by prudence and its willingness to do good balanced by the knowledge that government is never more dangerous than when our desire to have it help us blinds us to its great power to harm us . The first Republican president once said , While the people retain their virtue and their vigilance , no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can seriously injure the government in the short space of four years . If Lincoln could see what is happened in these last three and a half years , he might hedge a little on that statement . But , with the virtues that our legacy as a free people and with the vigilance that sustains liberty , we still have time to use our renewed compact to overcome the injuries that have been done to America these past three and a half years . First , we must overcome something the present administration has cooked up a new and altogether indigestible economic stew , one part inflation , one part high unemployment , one part recession , one part runaway taxes , one party deficit spending and seasoned by an energy crisis . It is an economic stew that has turned the national stomach . Ours are not problems of abstract economic theory . Those are problems of flesh and blood problems that cause pain and destroy the moral fiber of real people who should not suffer the further indignity of being told by the government that it is all somehow their fault . We do not have inflation because as Carter says we have lived too well . The head of a government which has utterly refused to live within its means and which has , in the last few days , told us that this year s deficit will be 60 billion , dares to point the finger of blame at business and labor , both of which have been engaged in a losing struggle just trying to stay even . High taxes , we are told , are somehow good for us , as if , when government spends our money it is not inflationary , but when we spend it , it is . Those who preside over the worst energy shortage in our history tell us to use less , so that we will run out of oil , gasoline , and natural gas a little more slowly . Conservation is desirable , of course , for we must not waste energy . But conservation is not the sole answer to our energy needs . America must get to work producing more energy . The Republican program for solving economic problems is based on growth and productivity . Large amounts of oil and natural gas lay beneath our land and off our shores , untouched because the present administration seems to believe the American people would rather see more regulation , taxes and controls than more energy . Coal offers great potential . So does nuclear energy produced under rigorous safety standards . It could supply electricity for thousands of industries and millions of jobs and homes . It must not be thwarted by a tiny minority opposed to economic growth which often finds friendly ears in regulatory agencies for its obstructionist campaigns . Make no mistake . We will not permit the safety of our people or our environment heritage to be jeopardized , but we are going to reaffirm that the economic prosperity of our people is a fundamental part of our environment . Our problems are both acute and chronic , yet all we hear from those in positions of leadership are the same tired proposals for more government tinkering , more meddling and more control all of which led us to this state in the first place . Can anyone look at the record of this administration and say , Well done Can anyone compare the state of our economy when the Carter Administration took office with where we are today and say , Keep up the good work Can anyone look at our reduced standing in the world today and say , Let us have four more years of this I believe the American people are going to answer these questions the first week of November and their answer will be , No we have had enough . And , then it will be up to us beginning next January 20th to offer an administration and congressional leadership of competence and more than a little courage . We must have the clarity of vision to see the difference between what is essential and what is merely desirable , and then the courage to bring our government back under control and make it acceptable to the people . It is essential that we maintain both the forward momentum of economic growth and the strength of the safety net beneath those in society who need help . We also believe it is essential that the integrity of all aspects of Social Security are preserved . Beyond these essentials , I believe it is clear our federal government is overgrown and overweight . Indeed , it is time for our government to go on a diet . Therefore , my first act as chief executive will be to impose an immediate and thorough freeze on federal hiring . Then , we are going to enlist the very best minds from business , labor and whatever quarter to conduct a detailed review of every department , bureau and agency that lives by federal appropriations . We are also going to enlist the help and ideas of many dedicated and hard working government employees at all levels who want a more efficient government as much as the rest of us do . I know that many are demoralized by the confusion and waste they confront in their work as a result of failed and failing policies . Our instructions to the groups we enlist will be simple and direct . We will remind them that government programs exist at the sufferance of the American taxpayer and are paid for with money earned by working men and women . Any program that represents a waste of their money a theft from their pocketbooks must have that waste eliminated or the program must go by executive order where possible by congressional action where necessary . Everything that can be run more effectively by state and local government we shall turn over to state and local government , along with the funding sources to pay for it . We are going to put an end to the money merry go round where our money becomes Washington s money , to be spent by the states and cities exactly the way the federal bureaucrats tell them to . I will not accept the excuse that the federal government has grown so big and powerful that it is beyond the control of any president , any administration or Congress . We are going to put an end to the notion that the American taxpayer exists to fund the federal government . The federal government exists to serve the American people . On January 20th , we are going to re establish that truth . Also on that date we are going to initiate action to get substantial relief for our taxpaying citizens and action to put people back to work . None of this will be based on any new form of monetary tinkering or fiscal sleight of hand . We will simply apply to government the common sense we all use in our daily lives . Work and family are at the center of our lives the foundation of our dignity as a free people . When we deprive people of what they have earned , or take away their jobs , we destroy their dignity and undermine their families . We cannot support our families unless there are jobs and we cannot have jobs unless people have both money to invest and the faith to invest it . There are concepts that stem from an economic system that for more than 200 years has helped us master a continent , create a previously undreamed of prosperity for our people and has fed millions of others around the globe . That system will continue to serve us in the future if our government will stop ignoring the basic values on which it was built and stop betraying the trust and good will of the American workers who keep it going . The American people are carrying the heaviest peacetime tax burden in our nation s history and it will grow even heavier , under present law , next January . We are taxing ourselves into economic exhaustion and stagnation , crushing our ability and incentive to save , invest and produce . This must stop . We must halt this fiscal self destruction and restore sanity to our economic system . I have long advocated a 30 percent reduction in income tax rates over a period of three years . This phased tax reduction would begin with a 10 percent down payment tax cut in 1981 , which the Republicans and Congress and I have already proposed . A phased reduction of tax rates would go a long way toward easing the heavy burden on the American people . But , we should not stop here . Within the context of economic conditions and appropriate budget priorities during each fiscal year of my presidency , I would strive to go further . This would include improvement in business depreciation taxes so we can stimulate investment in order to get plants and equipment replaced , put more Americans back to work and put our nation back on the road to being competitive in world commerce . We will also work to reduce the cost of government as a percentage of our gross national product . The first task of national leadership is to set honest and realistic priorities in our policies and our budget and I pledge that my administration will do that . When I talk of tax cuts , I am reminded that every major tax cut in this century has strengthened the economy , generated renewed productivity and ended up yielding new revenues for the government by creating new investment , new jobs and more commerce among our people . The present administration has been forced by us Republicans to play follow the leader with regard to a tax cut . But , in this election year we must take with the proverbial grain of salt any tax cut proposed by those who have given us the greatest tax increase in our history . When those in leadership give us tax increases and tell us we must also do with less , have they thought about those who have always had less especially the minorities This is like telling them that just as they step on the first rung of the ladder of opportunity , the ladder is being pulled out from under them . That may be the Democratic leadership s message to the minorities , but it will not be ours . Our message will be we have to move ahead , but we are not going to leave anyone behind . Thanks to the economic policies of the Democratic Party , millions of Americans find themselves out of work . Millions more have never even had a fair chance to learn new skills , hold a decent job , or secure for themselves and their families a share in the prosperity of this nation . It is time to put America back to work to make our cities and towns resound with the confident voices of men and women of all races , nationalities and faiths bringing home to their families a decent paycheck they can cash for honest money . For those without skills , we will find a way to help them get skills . For those without job opportunities , we will stimulate new opportunities , particularly in the inner cities where they live . For those who have abandoned hope , we will restore hope and we will welcome them into a great national crusade to make America great again When we move from domestic affairs and cast our eyes abroad , we see an equally sorry chapter on the record of the present administration . As Soviet combat brigade trains in Cuba , just 90 miles from our shores . A Soviet army of invasion occupies Afghanistan , further threatening our vital interests in the Middle East . America s defense strength is at its lowest ebb in a generation , while the Soviet Union is vastly outspending us in both strategic and conventional arms . Our European allies , looking nervously at the growing menace from the East , turn to us for leadership and fail to find it . And , incredibly more than 50 of our fellow Americans have been held captive for over eight months by a dictatorial foreign power that holds us up to ridicule before the world . Adversaries large and small test our will and seek to confound our resolve , but we are given weakness when we need strength vacillation when the times demand firmness . The Carter Administration lives in the world of make believe . Every day , drawing up a response to that day s problems , troubles , regardless of what happened yesterday and what will happen tomorrow . The rest of us , however , live in the real world . It is here that disasters are overtaking our nation without any real response from Washington . This is make believe , self deceit and above all transparent hypocrisy . For example , Carter says he supports the volunteer army , but he lets military pay and benefits slip so low that many of our enlisted personnel are actually eligible for food stamps . Re enlistment rates drop and , just recently , after he fought all week against a proposal to increase the pay of our men and women in uniform , he helicoptered to our carrier , the S . Nimitz , which was returning from long months of duty . He told the crew that he advocated better pay for them and their comrades Where does he really stand , now that he is back on shore I will tell you where I stand . I do not favor a peacetime draft or registration , but I do favor pay and benefit levels that will attract and keep highly motivated men and women in our volunteer forces and an active reserve trained and ready for an instant call in case of an emergency . There may be a sailor at the helm of the ship of state , but the ship has no rudder . Critical decisions are made at times almost in comic fashion , but who can laugh Who was not embarrassed when the administration handed a major propaganda victory in the United Nations to the enemies of Israel , our staunch Middle East ally for three decades , and them claim that the American vote was a mistake , the result of a failure of communication between the president , his secretary of state , and his ambassador Who does not feel a growing sense of unease as our allies , facing repeated instances of an amateurish and confused administration , reluctantly conclude that America is unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations as the leader of the free world Who does not feel rising alarm when the question in any discussion of foreign policy is no longer , Should we do something , but Do we have the capacity to do anything The administration which has brought us to this state is seeking your endorsement for four more years of weakness , indecision , mediocrity and incompetence . No American should vote until he or she has asked , is the United States stronger and more respected now than it was three and a half years ago Is the world today a safer place in which to live It is the responsibility of the president of the United States , in working for peace , to insure that the safety of our people cannot successfully be threatened by a hostile foreign power . As president , fulfilling that responsibility will be my number one priority . We are not a warlike people . Quite the opposite . We always seek to live in peace . We resort to force infrequently and with great reluctance and only after we have determined that it is absolutely necessary . We are awed and rightly so by the forces of destruction at loose in the world in this nuclear era . But neither can we be naive or foolish . Four times in my lifetime America has gone to war , bleeding the lives of its young men into the sands of beachheads , the fields of Europe and the jungles and rice paddies of Asia . We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong , but when they are weak . It is then that tyrants are tempted . We simply cannot learn these lessons the hard way again without risking our destruction . Of all the objectives we seek , first and foremost is the establishment of lasting world peace . We must always stand ready to negotiate in good faith , ready to pursue any reasonable avenue that holds forth the promise of lessening tensions and furthering the prospects of peace . But let our friends and those who may wish us ill take note the United States has an obligation to its citizens and to the people of the world never to let those who would destroy freedom dictate the future course of human life on this planet . I would regard my election as proof that we have renewed our resolve to preserve world peace and freedom . This nation will once again be strong enough to do that . This evening marks the last step save one of a campaign that has taken Nancy and me from one end of this great land to the other , over many months and thousands of miles . There are those who question the way we choose a president who say that our process imposes difficult and exhausting burdens on those who seek the office . I have not found it so . It is impossible to capture in words the splendor of this vast continent which God has granted as our portion of this creation . There are no words to express the extraordinary strength and character of this breed of people we call Americans . Everywhere we have met thousands of Democrats , Independents , and Republicans from all economic conditions and walks of life bound together in that community of shared values of family , work , neighborhood , peace and freedom . They are concerned , yes , but they are not frightened . They are disturbed , but not dismayed . They are the kind of men and women Tom Paine had in mind when he wrote during the darkest days of the American Revolution We have it in our power to begin the world over again . Nearly 150 years after Tom Paine wrote those words , an American president told the generation of the Great Depression that it had a rendezvous with destiny . I believe that this generation of Americans today has a rendezvous with destiny . Tonight , let us dedicate ourselves to renewing the American compact . I ask you not simply to Trust me , but to trust your values our values and to hold me responsible for living up to them . I ask you to trust that American spirit which knows no ethnic , religious , social , political , regional , or economic boundaries the spirit that burned with zeal in the hearts of millions of immigrants from every corner of the Earth who came here in search of freedom . Some say that spirit no longer exists . But I have seen it I have felt it all across the land in the big cities , the small towns and in rural America . The American spirit is still there , ready to blaze into life if you and I are willing to do what has to be done the practical , down to earth things that will stimulate our economy , increase productivity and put America back to work . The time is now to resolve that the basis of a firm and principled foreign policy is one that takes the world as it is and seeks to change it by leadership and example not by harangue , harassment or wishful thinking . The time is now to say that while we shall seek new friendships and expand and improve others , we shall not do so by breaking our word or casting aside old friends and allies . And , the time is now to redeem promises once made to the American people by another candidate , in another time and another place . He said , For three long years I have been going up and down this country preaching that government federal , state , and local costs too much . I shall not stop that preaching . As an immediate program of action , we must abolish useless offices . We must eliminate unnecessary functions of government . . . we must consolidate subdivisions of government and , like the private citizen , give up luxuries which we can no longer afford . I propose to you , my friends , and through you that government of all kinds , big and little be made solvent and that the example be set by the president of the United State and his Cabinet . So said Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention in July 1932 . The time is now , my fellow Americans , to recapture our destiny , to take it into our own hands . But , to do this will take many of us , working together . I ask you tonight to volunteer your help in this cause so we can carry our message throughout the land . Yes , is not now the time that we , the people , carried out these unkempt promises Let us pledge to each other and to all America on this July day 48 years later , we intend to do just that . I have thought of something that is not part of my speech and I am worried over whether I should do it . Can we doubt that only a Divine Providence placed this land , this island of freedom , here as a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe freely Jews and Christians enduring persecution behind the Iron Curtain , the boat people of Southeast Asia , of Cuba and Haiti , the victims of drought and famine in Africa , the freedom fighters of Afghanistan and our own countrymen held in savage captivity . I will confess that I have been a little afraid to suggest what I am going to suggest I am more afraid not to that we begin our crusade joined together in a moment of silent prayer . God bless America .<speech_sep>Chairwoman Margaret Bush Wilson , I thank you very much for that introduction and that explanation also of my year s tardiness in getting here . I remember a year ago I was in California when I received your invitation at the same time that I received a clipping that I had not answered your invitation . Now , at that moment it was almost impossible for me well , it was impossible to find a way not even Air Force One could have bridged from California to Florida . But I am delighted that this time , as you say , there was better staff work and I was able to get the invitation in plenty of time . President Cobb , Vice Chairman Kelly Alexander , and Executive Director Benjamin Hooks , the ladies and gentlemen here on the platform , the members of the board of directors , and you , ladies and gentlemen , representatives to this convention I am very happy to be talking to the NAACP s 72rd annual convention . There are many things that we need to discuss , and I thank you for the invitation to do so . Let us talk today about the needs of the future , not the misunderstandings of the past about new ideas , not old ones about what must become a continuing dialog , not a dialog that flows only at intermittent conventions that we both attend . Part of that continuing dialog took place last Tuesday when I met with Ben Hooks and Margaret Bush Wilson in the Oval Office . Our discussion was candid and useful . The wide range of our conversation showed that there is a great deal to be gained when we take time to share our views . And while our communication should always deal with current issues of importance , it must never stray far from our national commitment to battle against discrimination and increase our knowledge of each other . A few isolated groups in the backwater of American life still hold perverted notions of what America is all about . Recently in some places in the nation there is been a disturbing reoccurrence of bigotry and violence . If I may , from the platform of this organization , known for its tolerance , I would like to address a few remarks to those groups who still adhere to senseless racism and religious prejudice , to those individuals who persist in such hateful behavior . If I were speaking to them instead of to you , I would say to them , You are the ones who are out of step with our society . You are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of the dream that is America . And this country , because of what it stands for , will not stand for your conduct . My administration will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who , by violence or intimidation , would attempt to deny Americans their constitutional rights . Another kind of terror has recently plagued the city of Atlanta . Not long ago in a speech before the Congress I read the now famous pajama letter from Peter Sweeney . If only my letters from children could all be as lighthearted as Peter s . Other letters are more poignant . When little girls in Atlanta write asking that I make things right so they will not be scared anymore , even a President of the United States can feel a little helpless . We committed the resources of the FBI and a number of Federal agencies to help Mayor Jackson . I appointed Vice President Bush to head this Federal task force , and its work will continue until this tragic episode is over . Not counting manpower and equipment , we have provided over 4 million to this cause . I know that all of us wish we could tell the children of Atlanta that they need no longer fear , and until we can say that , however , we will not be satisfied until those children can once again play safely in their school yards and parks . Our dialog must also include discussions on how we can best protect the rights and privileges of all our citizens . My administration will root out any case of government discrimination against minorities and uphold and enforce the laws that protect them . I emphasize that we will not retreat on the nation s commitment to equal treatment of all citizens . Now , that , in my view , is the primary responsibility of National Government . The Attorney General is now carefully studying the decennial redistricting plans being submitted under the current Voting Rights Act . As soon as we have all the information there will be a decision regarding extension of the act . Until a decision is announced , you should know this I regard voting as the most sacred right of free men and women . We have not sacrificed and fought and toiled to protect that right so that now we can sit back and permit a barrier to come between a secret ballot and any citizen who makes a choice to cast it . Nothing nothing will change that as long as I am in a position to uphold the Constitution of the United States . In the months ahead , our dialog also will include tough and realistic questions about the role of the Federal Government in the black community . I am not satisfied with its results , and I do not think you are either . And the failures of the past have been particularly hard on the minority poor , because their hopes have failed as surely as the Federal programs that built those hopes . But I must not be the only one who questions about government policies . Can the black teenager who faces a staggering unemployment rate feel that government policies are a success Can the black wage earner who sees more and more of his take home pay shrinking because of government taxes feel satisfied Can black parents say , despite a massive influx of Federal aid , that educational standards in our schools have improved appreciably Can the women I saw on television recently whose family had been on welfare for three generations and who feared that her children might be the fourth can she believe that current government policies will save her children from such a fate We ask these tough questions , because we share your concerns about the future of the black community . We ask these questions , because the blacks of America should not be patronized as just one more voting bloc to be wooed and won . You are individuals as we all are . Some have special needs . I do not think the Federal Government has met those needs . I have been listening to the specific needs of many people blacks , farmers , refugees , union members , women , small business men and women , and other groups they are commonly referred to as special interest groups . Well , in reality they are all members of the interest group that I spoke of the day I took the oath of office . They are the people of America . And I am pleased to serve that special interest group . The people of the inner cities will be represented by this administration every bit as much as the citizens of Flagstaff , Arizona , Ithaca , New York , or Dixon , Illinois , where I grew up . Anyone who becomes President realizes he must represent all the people of the land , not just those of a home State or a particular party . Nor can he be just President of those who voted for him . But it does not matter what groups we belong to , what area we live in , how much or how little we earn the economy affects every single one of us regardless of our other interests and affiliations . We have proceeded full throttle on our economic recovery program , because a strong , growing economy without inflation is the surest , most equitable way to ease the pressures on all the segments of our society . The well being of blacks , like the well being of every other American , is linked directly to the health of the economy . For example , industries in which blacks had made sufficient gains in employment substantial gains , like autos and steel have been particularly hard hit . And last hired , first fired is a familiar refrain to too many black workers . And I do not need to tell this group what inflation has done to those who can least afford it . A declining economy is a poisonous gas that claims its first victims in poor neighborhoods , before floating out into the community at large . Therefore , in our national debate over budget and tax proposals , we shall not concede the moral high ground to the proponents of those policies that are responsible in the first place for our economic mess a mess which has injured all Americans . We will not concede the moral high ground to those who show more concern for Federal programs than they do for what really determines the income and financial health of blacks the nation s economy . Now , I know you have been told that my proposal for economic recovery is designed to discriminate against all who are economically deprived . Now , those who say that could be confused by the misstatements that have been made by some who are either ignorant of the facts or those who are practicing , for political reasons , pure demagoguery . Rebuilding America s economy is an absolute moral imperative if we are to avoid splitting this society in two with class against class . I do not intend to let America drift further toward economic segregation . We must change the economic direction of this country to bring more blacks into the mainstream , and we must do it now . And in 1938 , before we had the equality we know today , Langston Hughes wrote Let America Be America Again . And he wrote Oh , yes , I see it plain America never was America to me . And yet I swear this oath America will be America will be . That is the philosophy the people proclaimed in last November s election . America will be . And this time , she will be for everyone . Together , we can recreate for every citizen the same economic opportunities that we saw lift up a land of immigrant people , the kind of opportunities that have swept the hungry and the persecuted into the mainstream of our life since the American experiment began . To a number of black Americans , the economy has been something of an underground railroad it has spirited them away from poverty to middle class prosperity and beyond . But too many blacks still remain behind . A glance at the statistics will show that a large proportion of the black people have not found economic freedom . Nationwide , for example , 43 percent of black families in 1979 had money incomes under 10 , 000 . Harriet Tubman , who was known as the conductor of that earlier underground railroad , said on her first escape from slavery , When I found I had crossed that line , I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person . There was such a glory over everything . Even after a century the beauty of her words is powerful . We can only imagine the soaring of her soul , what a feeling that must have been when she crossed into freedom and the physical and mental shackles fell from her person . Harriet Tubman s glory was the glory of the American experience . It was a glory which had no color or religious preference or nationality . It was simply , eloquently , the universal thirst that all people have for freedom . Well , there are poor people in this country who should experience just such an elation if they found the economic freedom of a solid job , a productive job not one concocted by government and dependent on Washington winds a real job where they could put in a good day s work , complain about the boss , and then go home with confidence and self respect . Why has this Nation been unable to fill such a basic , admirable need The government can provide subsistence , yes , but it seldom moves people up the economic ladder . And as I have said before , you have to get on the ladder before you can move up on it . I believe many in Washington , over the years , have been more dedicated to making needy people government dependent rather than independent . They have created a new kind of bondage , because regardless of how honest their intention in the beginning , those they set out to help soon became clients essential to the well being of those who administered the programs . An honest program would be dedicated to making people independent , no longer in need of government assistance . But then what would happen to those who made a career of helping Well , Americans have been very generous , with good intentions and billions of dollars , toward those they believed were living in hardship . And yet , in spite of the hopes , the government has never lived up to the dreams of poor people . Just as the Emancipation Proclamation freed black people 118 years ago , today we need to declare an economic emancipation . I genuinely and deeply believe the economic package we have put forth will move us toward black economic freedom , because it is aimed at lifting an entire country and not just parts of it . There is a truth to the words spoken by John Kennedy that a rising tide lifts all boats . Yes , I know it is been said , What about the fellow without a boat who cannot swim Well , I believe John Kennedy s figure of speech was referring to the benefits which accrue to all when the economy is flourishing . Now , much has been said and written not all of it flattering about the savings I have proposed in the budget which were adopted by the House last Friday . I can assure you that the budget savings we have advocated are much more equitable than the tremendous cuts in social programs , made by inflation and the declining economy , which cannot find jobs for almost 8 million men and women who are unemployed . Those cuts are exacted without regard to need or age . Let me give some examples . In the prosperity of the 1960 s , an era of only a few Federal programs costing very little , the number of people living in poverty was reduced by nearly 50 percent . During the stagflation of the 1970 s with many Federal programs with huge budgets , the number living in poverty was reduced by only 6 percent . In the 1960 s black unemployment fell from 10 . 7 percent to 6 . 4 percent . In the 1970 s it increased from 6 . 4 percent to 11 . 3 percent . What is more , relative to the white unemployment rate , black unemployment fell more in the 1960 s but rose more in the 1970 s . The declining economy has cut black family income . From 1959 to 1969 , the median family income of blacks , after adjusting for inflation , rose at 5 percent per year , but from 1969 to 1979 , income actually dropped . Now , these are hard economic facts which are hard to take , because they show massive amounts of government aid and intervention have failed to produce the desired results . A strong economy returns the greatest good to the black population . It returns a benefit greater than that provided by specific Federal programs . By slowing the growth of government and by limiting the tax burden and thus stimulating investment , we will also be reducing inflation and unemployment . We will be creating jobs , nearly 3 million additional new jobs by 1986 . We will be aiding minority businesses , which have been particularly hard hit by the scarcity of capital and the prohibitive interest rates . And these concerns are what the bipartisan tax cut proposal currently before the Congress is all about . I said the other day in our conversation in the Oval Office that the income a year or two ago I do not have the most recent figure for the black community was something like 140 billion . Now , in most neighborhoods what really brings prosperity is when the income of that neighborhood is then multiplied by turning over several times within that community . I must tell you that in the black communities in America the turnover is less than once before the dollars , those 140 billion , go out into the community at large . And that has to be changed . In the convention last summer Benjamin Hooks the one that I missed well , no , this was the Republican Convention I made that one Benjamin Hooks said to the assembled delegates , We must decide as a nation if we are to become prisoners of our past or possessors of an enlightened and progressive future . Those are the very words I want to say to you today . We cannot be tied to the old ways of solving our economic and racial problems . But it is time we looked to new answers and new ways of thinking that will accomplish the very ends the New Deal and the Great Society anticipated . We are not repealing the gains of black people . We are solidifying those gains and making them safe for your children and grandchildren . It is time that we found ways to make the American economic pie bigger instead of just cutting an ever smaller pie into more but smaller slices . It is time we welcomed those Americans into the circle of prosperity to let them share in the wonders of our society , and it is time to break the cycle of dependency that has become the legacy of so many Federal programs that no longer work indeed , some of which never did work . Let me give you an idea of how bountiful this famous economic pie could have been by now . If productivity had not stopped growing and then started downhill after 1965 , the gross national product today would be 850 billion bigger enough to balance the budget , cut personal and social security taxes in half , and still provide every American with an extra 2 , 500 in spending money . And all of this would have happened with the compliments of the private sector . Now , you wisely learned to harness the Federal Government in the hard pull toward equality , and that was right , because guaranteeing equality of treatment is government s proper function . But as the last decade of statistics I just read indicated , government is no longer the strong draft horse of minority progress , because it has attempted to do too many things it is not equipped to do . I ask you if it is not time to hitch up a fresh horse to finish the task . Free enterprise is a powerful workhorse that can solve many problems of the black community that government alone can no longer solve . The black leadership of this Nation has shown tremendous courage , both physical and intellectual , and great creativity as it sought to bring equality to its people . You in this audience are the inheritors of that proud black heritage . You are the black leaders of today , and I believe you possess the very same courage and creativity . I ask you to use that courage and creativity to examine the challenges that are facing not just blacks but all of America . I ask you to question the status quo as your predecessors did and look for new and imaginative ways to overcome minority problems . I am talking about the kind of courage and questioning your chairman , Margaret Bush Wilson , showed in taking the heat for the NAACP s controversial 1978 energy statement a statement which shook the elitists of our country back into the real world , at least for a time . What I am asking you to consider requires not so much a leap of faith , but a realization that the Federal Government alone is just not capable of doing the job we all want done for you or any other Americans . In the months ahead , as the administration is free to turn attention from the economic program to other needs of America , we will be advancing proposals on a number of issues of concern to this convention . The inner cities , for example , should be communities , neighborhoods , not warehouses of despair where children are bused out and ineffectual Federal funds are bused in . I believe that with the aid of commonsense government assistance and the use of free enterprise zones , with less reliance on busing and more reliance on better , basic education , and with an emphasis on local activism , such as you represent , communities can be reinvigorated . Certainly , we are all inspired by the wonderful example of Marva Collins in Chicago , the gallant lady who has the educational grit to make Shakespeare admirers out of inner city children . She just proves to me what a friend of mine , Wilson Riles , California s superintendent of education , used to say The concept that black children cannot learn unless they are sitting among white children is utter and complete nonsense . Now , Riles was not suggesting that integration is not a good and proper thing it is . And it is good for all of us when it is brought about with commonsense and attention to what is best for the children . We plan to take a look , a comprehensive look , at the education of blacks from primary school upward and strengthen the base of black colleges , which are a sound educational investment . They are more than that . They are a proud tradition , a symbol of black determination and accomplishment , and I feel deeply they must be preserved . We have increased the share of Department of Education Title III funds spend on black colleges , and that trend will continue . We have equal concern for the black business leaders of today . Minority business development , as I indicated earlier , is a key to black economic progress . Black owned businesses are especially important in neighborhood economies where the dollars , as I said , spent have a beneficial multiplier effect . We want your input . I expect my domestic advisers to be in regular touch with you as our policies evolve . We may not always agree , but new ideas are often sparked by opinions clashing . I did not come here today bearing the promises of government handouts , which others have brought and which you have rightly learned to mistrust . Instead , I ask you to join me to build a coalition for change . Seventy two years ago the famous call went forth , the call for a conference emphasizing the civil and political rights of blacks . And the result of that call , of course , was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . Well , today let us issue a call for new perspectives on the economic challenges facing black Americans . Let us issue a call for exciting programs to spring America forward toward the next century , an America full of new solutions to old problems . We will link hands to build an era where we can put fear behind us and hope in front of us . It can be an era in which programs are less important than opportunities . It can be an era where we all reach out in reconciliation instead of anger and dispute . In the war in Vietnam several years ago , a live grenade fell among a group of American soldiers . They were frozen with horror knowing they were only seconds away from death . Then one young soldier , a black , threw himself on the grenade , covering it with his helmet and his body . He died to save his comrades . Greater glory hath no man . Congressional Medal of Honor winner , posthumously presented , Garfield Langhorn s last whispered words were , You have to care . Let us care . Let us work to build a nation that is free of racism , full of opportunity , and determined to loosen the creative energies of every person of every race , of every station , to make a better life . It will be my honor to stand alongside you to answer this call . Thank you .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans It is been nearly three years since I first spoke to you from this room . Together we have faced many difficult problems , and I have come to feel a special bond of kinship with each one of you . Tonight I am here for a different reason . I have come to a difficult personal decision as to whether or not I should seek reelection . When I first addressed you from here , our national defenses were dangerously weak , we had suffered humiliation in Iran , and at home we were adrift , possibly because of a failure here in Washington to trust the courage and character of you , the people . But worst of all , we were on the brink of economic collapse from years of government overindulgence and abusive overtaxation . Thus , I had to report that we were in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression . Inflation had risen to over 13 percent in 1979 and to 19 percent in March of 1980 . Those back to back years of price explosions were the highest in more than 60 years . In the five years before I came here , taxes had actually doubled . Your cost of living pay raises just bumped you into higher tax brackets . Interest rates over 21 percent , the highest in 120 years productivity , down 2 consecutive years industrial production down actual wages and earnings down the only things going up were prices , unemployment , taxes , and the size of government . While you tightened your belt , the federal government tightened its grip . Well , things have changed . This past year inflation dropped down to 3 . 2 percent . Interest rates , cut nearly in half . Retail sales are surging . Homes are being built and sold . Auto assembly lines are opening up . And in just the last year , 4 million people have found jobs the greatest employment gain in 33 years . By beginning to rebuild our defenses , we have restored credible deterrence and can confidently seek a secure and lasting peace , as well as a reduction in arms . As I said Wednesday night , America is back and standing tall . We have begun to restore great American values the dignity of work , the warmth of family , the strength of neighborhood , and the nourishment of human freedom . But our work is not finished . We have more to do in creating jobs , achieving control over government spending , returning more autonomy to the States , keeping peace in a more settled world , and seeing if we cannot find room in our schools for God . At my inaugural , I quoted words that had been spoken over 200 years ago by Joseph Warren , president of the Massachusetts Congress . On you depend the fortunes of America , he told his fellow Americans . You are to decide the important question on which rests the happiness and liberty of millions yet unborn . And he added , Act worthy of yourselves . Over these last three years , Nancy and I have been sustained by the way you , the real heroes of American democracy , have met Warren s challenge . You were magnificent as we pulled the Nation through the long night of our national calamity . You have , indeed , acted worthy of yourselves . Your high standards make us remember the central question of public service Why are we here Well , we are here to see that government continues to serve you , not the other way around . We are here to lift the weak and to build the peace , and most important , we are here , as Warren said , to act today for the happiness and liberty of millions yet unborn , to seize the future so that every new child of this beloved Republic can dream heroic dreams . If we do less , we betray the memory of those who have given so much . This historic room and the Presidency belong to you . It is your right and responsibility every four years to give someone temporary custody of this office and of the institution of the Presidency . You so honored me , and I am grateful grateful and proud of what , together , we have accomplished . We have made a new beginning . Vice President Bush and I would like to have your continued support and cooperation in completing what we began three years ago . I am , therefore , announcing that I am a candidate and will seek reelection to the office I presently hold . Thank you for the trust you have placed in me . God bless you , and good night .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans Some 2 months ago we were shocked by the brutal massacre of 269 men , women , and children , more than 60 of them Americans , in the shooting down of a Korean airliner . Now , in these past several days , violence has erupted again , in Lebanon and Grenada . In Lebanon , we have some 1 , 600 marines , part of a multinational force that is trying to help the people of Lebanon restore order and stability to that troubled land . Our marines are assigned to the south of the city of Beirut , near the only airport operating in Lebanon . Just a mile or so to the north is the Italian contingent and not far from them , the French and a company of British soldiers . This past Sunday , at 22 minutes after 6 Beirut time , with dawn just breaking , a truck , looking like a lot of other vehicles in the city , approached the airport on a busy , main road . There was nothing in its appearance to suggest it was any different than the trucks or cars that were normally seen on and around the airport . But this one was different . At the wheel was a young man on a suicide mission . The truck carried some 2 , 000 pounds of explosives , but there was no way our marine guards could know this . Their first warning that something was wrong came when the truck crashed through a series of barriers , including a chain link fence and barbed wire entanglements . The guards opened fire , but it was too late . The truck smashed through the doors of the headquarters building in which our marines were sleeping and instantly exploded . The four story concrete building collapsed in a pile of rubble . More than 200 of the sleeping men were killed in that one hideous , insane attack . Many others suffered injury and are hospitalized here or in Europe . This was not the end of the horror . At almost the same instant , another vehicle on a suicide and murder mission crashed into the headquarters of the French peacekeeping force , an eight story building , destroying it and killing more than 50 French soldiers . Prior to this day of horror , there had been several tragedies for our men in the multinational force . Attacks by snipers and mortar fire had taken their toll . I called bereaved parents and or widows of the victims to express on behalf of all of us our sorrow and sympathy . Sometimes there were questions . And now many of you are asking Why should our young men be dying in Lebanon Why is Lebanon important to us Well , it is true , Lebanon is a small country , more than five and a half thousand miles from our shores on the edge of what we call the Middle East . But every President who has occupied this office in recent years has recognized that peace in the Middle East is of vital concern to our nation and , indeed , to our allies in Western Europe and Japan . We have been concerned because the Middle East is a powderkeg four times in the last 30 years , the Arabs and Israelis have gone to war . And each time , the world has teetered near the edge of catastrophe . The area is key to the economic and political life of the West . Its strategic importance , its energy resources , the Suez Canal , and the well being of the nearly 200 million people living there all are vital to us and to world peace . If that key should fall into the hands of a power or powers hostile to the free world , there would be a direct threat to the United States and to our allies . We have another reason to be involved . Since 1948 our Nation has recognized and accepted a moral obligation to assure the continued existence of Israel as a nation . Israel shares our democratic values and is a formidable force an invader of the Middle East would have to reckon with . For several years , Lebanon has been torn by internal strife . Once a prosperous , peaceful nation , its government had become ineffective in controlling the militias that warred on each other . Sixteen months ago , we were watching on our TV screens the shelling and bombing of Beirut which was being used as a fortress by PLO bands . Hundreds and hundreds of civilians were being killed and wounded in the daily battles . Syria , which makes no secret of its claim that Lebanon should be a part of a Greater Syria , was occupying a large part of Lebanon . Today , Syria has become a home for 7 , 000 Soviet advisers and technicians who man a massive amount of Soviet weaponry , including SS 21 ground to ground missiles capable of reaching vital areas of Israel . A little over a year ago , hoping to build on the Camp David accords , which had led to peace between Israel and Egypt , I proposed a peace plan for the Middle East to end the wars between the Arab States and Israel . It was based on resolutions 242 and 338 and called for a fair and just solution to the Palestinian problem , as well as a fair and just settlement of issues between the Arab States and Israel . Before the necessary negotiations could begin , it was essential to get all foreign forces out of Lebanon and to end the fighting there . So , why are we there Well , the answer is straightforward to help bring peace to Lebanon and stability to the vital Middle East . To that end , the multinational force was created to help stabilize the situation in Lebanon until a government could be established and a Lebanese army mobilized to restore Lebanese sovereignty over its own soil as the foreign forces withdrew . Israel agreed to withdraw as did Syria , but Syria then reneged on its promise . Over 10 , 000 Palestinians who had been bringing ruin down on Beirut , however , did leave the country . Lebanon has formed a government under the leadership of President Gemayal , and that government , with our assistance and training , has set up its own army . In only a year s time , that army has been rebuilt . It is a good army , composed of Lebanese of all factions . A few weeks ago , the Israeli army pulled back to the Awali River in southern Lebanon . Despite fierce resistance by Syrian backed forces , the Lebanese army was able to hold the line and maintain the defensive perimeter around Beirut . In the year that our marines have been there , Lebanon has made important steps toward stability and order . The physical presence of the marines lends support to both the Lebanese Government and its army . It allows the hard work of diplomacy to go forward . Indeed , without the peacekeepers from the S . , France , Italy , and Britain , the efforts to find a peaceful solution in Lebanon would collapse . As to that narrower question what exactly is the operational mission of the marines the answer is , to secure a piece of Beirut , to keep order in their sector , and to prevent the area from becoming a battlefield . Our marines are not just sitting in an airport . Part of their task is to guard that airport . Because of their presence , the airport has remained operational . In addition , they patrol the surrounding area . This is their part a limited , but essential part in the larger effort that I have described . If our marines must be there , I am asked , why cannot we make them safer Who committed this latest atrocity against them and why Well , we will do everything we can to ensure that our men are as safe as possible . We ordered the battleship New Jersey to join our naval forces offshore . Without even firing them , the threat of its 16 inch guns silenced those who once fired down on our marines from the hills , and they are a good part of the reason we suddenly had a ceasefire . We are doing our best to make our forces less vulnerable to those who want to snipe at them or send in future suicide missions . Secretary Shultz called me today from Europe , where he was meeting with the Foreign Ministers of our allies in the multinational force . They remain committed to our task . And plans were made to share information as to how we can improve security for all our men . We have strong circumstantial evidence that the attack on the marines was directed by terrorists who used the same method to destroy our Embassy in Beirut . Those who directed this atrocity must be dealt justice , and they will be . The obvious purpose behind the sniping and , now , this attack was to weaken American will and force the withdrawal of and French forces from Lebanon . The clear intent of the terrorists was to eliminate our support of the Lebanese Government and to destroy the ability of the Lebanese people to determine their own destiny . To answer those who ask if we are serving any purpose in being there , let me answer a question with a question . Would the terrorists have launched their suicide attacks against the multinational force if it were not doing its job The multinational force was attacked precisely because it is doing the job it was sent to do in Beirut . It is accomplishing its mission . Now then , where do we go from here What can we do now to help Lebanon gain greater stability so that our marines can come home Well , I believe we can take three steps now that will make a difference . First , we will accelerate the search for peace and stability in that region . Little attention has been paid to the fact that we have had special envoys there working , literally , around the clock to bring the warring factions together . This coming Monday in Geneva , President Gemayel of Lebanon will sit down with other factions from his country to see if national reconciliation can be achieved . He has our firm support . I will soon be announcing a replacement for Bud McFarlane , who was preceded by Phil Habib . Both worked tirelessly and must be credited for much if not most of the progress we have made . Second , we will work even more closely with our allies in providing support for the Government of Lebanon and for the rebuilding of a national consensus . Third , we will ensure that the multinational peace keeping forces , our marines , are given the greatest possible protection . Our Commandant of the Marine Corps , General Kelley , returned from Lebanon today and will be advising us on steps we can take to improve security . Vice President Bush returned just last night from Beirut and gave me a full report of his brief visit . Beyond our progress in Lebanon , let us remember that our main goal and purpose is to achieve a broader peace in all of the Middle East . The factions and bitterness that we see in Lebanon are just a microcosm of the difficulties that are spread across much of that region . A peace initiative for the entire Middle East , consistent with the Camp David accords and resolutions 242 and 338 , still offers the best hope for bringing peace to the region . Let me ask those who say we should get out of Lebanon If we were to leave Lebanon now , what message would that send to those who foment instability and terrorism If America were to walk away from Lebanon , what chance would there be for a negotiated settlement , producing a unified democratic Lebanon If we turned our backs on Lebanon now , what would be the future of Israel At stake is the fate of only the second Arab country to negotiate a major agreement with Israel . That is another accomplishment of this past year , the May 17th accord signed by Lebanon and Israel . If terrorism and intimidation succeed , it will be a devastating blow to the peace process and to Israel s search for genuine security . It will not just be Lebanon sentenced to a future of chaos . Can the United States , or the free world , for that matter , stand by and see the Middle East incorporated into the Soviet bloc What of Western Europe and Japan s dependence on Middle East oil for the energy to fuel their industries The Middle East is , as I have said , vital to our national security and economic well being . Brave young men have been taken from us . Many others have been grievously wounded . Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted They gave their lives in defense of our national security every bit as much as any man who ever died fighting in a war . We must not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from their courageous sacrifice . We are a nation with global responsibilities . We are not somewhere else in the world protecting someone else s interests we are there protecting our own . I received a message from the father of a marine in Lebanon . He told me , In a world where we speak of human rights , there is a sad lack of acceptance of responsibility . My son has chosen the acceptance of responsibility for the privilege of living in this country . Certainly in this country one does not inherently have rights unless the responsibility for these rights is accepted . Kenneth Morrison said that while he was waiting to learn if his son was one of the dead . I was thrilled for him to learn today that his son Ross is alive and well and carrying on his duties in Lebanon . Let us meet our responsibilities . For longer than any of us can remember , the people of the Middle East have lived from war to war with no prospect for any other future . That dreadful cycle must be broken . Why are we there Well , a Lebanese mother told one of our Ambassadors that her little girl had only attended school 2 of the last 8 years . Now , because of our presence there , she said her daughter could live a normal life . With patience and firmness , we can help bring peace to that strife torn region and make our own lives more secure . Our role is to help the Lebanese put their country together , not to do it for them . Now , I know another part of the world is very much on our minds , a place much closer to our shores Grenada . The island is only twice the size of the District of Columbia , with a total population of about 110 , 000 people . Grenada and a half dozen other Caribbean islands here were , until recently , British colonies . They are now independent states and members of the British Commonwealth . While they respect each other s independence , they also feel a kinship with each other and think of themselves as one people . In 1979 trouble came to Grenada . Maurice Bishop , a protege of Fidel Castro , staged a military coup and overthrew the government which had been elected under the constitution left to the people by the British . He sought the help of Cuba in building an airport , which he claimed was for tourist trade , but which looked suspiciously suitable for military aircraft , including Soviet built long range bombers . The six sovereign countries and one remaining colony are joined together in what they call the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States . The six became increasingly alarmed as Bishop built an army greater than all of theirs combined . Obviously , it was not purely for defense . In this last year or so , Prime Minister Bishop gave indications that he might like better relations with the United States . He even made a trip to our country and met with senior officials of the White House and the State Department . Whether he was serious or not , we will never know . On October 12th , a small group in his militia seized him and put him under arrest . They were , if anything , more radical and more devoted to Castro s Cuba than he had been . Several days later , a crowd of citizens appeared before Bishop s home , freed him , and escorted him toward the headquarters of the military council . They were fired upon . A number , including some children , were killed , and Bishop was seized . He and several members of his cabinet were subsequently executed , and a 24 hour shoot to kill curfew was put in effect . Grenada was without a government , its only authority exercised by a self proclaimed band of military men . There were then about 1 , 000 of our citizens on Grenada , 800 of them students in George s University Medical School . Concerned that they had be harmed or held as hostages , I ordered a flotilla of ships , then on its way to Lebanon with marines , part of our regular rotation program , to circle south on a course that would put them somewhere in the vicinity of Grenada in case there should be a need to evacuate our people . Last weekend , I was awakened in the early morning hours and told that six members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States , joined by Jamaica and Barbados , had sent an urgent request that we join them in a military operation to restore order and democracy to Grenada . They were proposing this action under the terms of a treaty , a mutual assistance pact that existed among them . These small , peaceful nations needed our help . Three of them do not have armies at all , and the others have very limited forces . The legitimacy of their request , plus my own concern for our citizens , dictated my decision . I believe our government has a responsibility to go to the aid of its citizens , if their right to life and liberty is threatened . The nightmare of our hostages in Iran must never be repeated . We knew we had little time and that complete secrecy was vital to ensure both the safety of the young men who would undertake this mission and the Americans they were about to rescue . The Joint Chiefs worked around the clock to come up with a plan . They had little intelligence information about conditions on the island . We had to assume that several hundred Cubans working on the airport could be military reserves . Well , as it turned out , the number was much larger , and they were a military force . Six hundred of them have been taken prisoner , and we have discovered a complete base with weapons and communications equipment , which makes it clear a Cuban occupation of the island had been planned . Two hours ago we released the first photos from Grenada . They included pictures of a warehouse of military equipment one of three we have uncovered so far . This warehouse contained weapons and ammunition stacked almost to the ceiling , enough to supply thousands of terrorists . Grenada , we were told , was a friendly island paradise for tourism . Well , it was not . It was a Soviet Cuban colony , being readied as a major military bastion to export terror and undermine democracy . We got there just in time . I cannot say enough in praise of our military Army rangers and paratroopers , Navy , Marine , and Air Force personnel those who planned a brilliant campaign and those who carried it out . Almost instantly , our military seized the two airports , secured the campus where most of our students were , and are now in the mopping up phase . It should be noted that in all the planning , a top priority was to minimize risk , to avoid casualties to our own men and also the Grenadian forces as much as humanly possible . But there were casualties , and we all owe a debt to those who lost their lives or were wounded . They were few in number , but even one is a tragic price to pay . It is our intention to get our men out as soon as possible . Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica I called that wrong she pronounces it Dominica she is Chairman of OECShe is calling for help from Commonwealth nations in giving the people their right to establish a constitutional government on Grenada . We anticipate that the Governor General , a Grenadian , will participate in setting up a provisional government in the interim . The events in Lebanon and Grenada , though oceans apart , are closely related . Not only has Moscow assisted and encouraged the violence in both countries , but it provides direct support through a network of surrogates and terrorists . It is no coincidence that when the thugs tried to wrest control over Grenada , there were 30 Soviet advisers and hundreds of Cuban military and paramilitary forces on the island . At the moment of our landing , we communicated with the Governments of Cuba and the Soviet Union and told them we would offer shelter and security to their people on Grenada . Regrettably , Castro ordered his men to fight to the death , and some did . The others will be sent to their homelands . You know , there was a time when our national security was based on a standing army here within our own borders and shore batteries of artillery along our coasts , and , of course , a navy to keep the sealanes open for the shipping of things necessary to our well being . The world has changed . Today , our national security can be threatened in faraway places . It is up to all of us to be aware of the strategic importance of such places and to be able to identify them . Sam Rayburn once said that freedom is not something a nation can work for once and win forever . He said it is like an insurance policy its premiums must be kept up to date . In order to keep it , we have to keep working for it and sacrificing for it just as long as we live . If we do not , our children may not know the pleasure of working to keep it , for it may not be theirs to keep . In these last few days , I have been more sure than I have ever been that we Americans of today will keep freedom and maintain peace . I have been made to feel that by the magnificent spirit of our young men and women in uniform and by something here in our Nation s Capital . In this city , where political strife is so much a part of our lives , I have seen Democratic leaders in the Congress join their Republican colleagues , send a message to the world that we are all Americans before we are anything else , and when our country is threatened , we stand shoulder to shoulder in support of our men and women in the Armed Forces . May I share something with you I think you had like to know It is something that happened to the Commandant of our Marine Corps , General Paul Kelley , while he was visiting our critically injured marines in an Air Force hospital . It says more than any of us could ever hope to say about the gallantry and heroism of these young men , young men who serve so willingly so that others might have a chance at peace and freedom in their own lives and in the life of their country . I will let General Kelley s words describe the incident . He spoke of a young marine with more tubes going in and out of his body than I have ever seen in one body . He could not see very well . He reached up and grabbed my four stars , just to make sure I was who I said I was . He held my hand with a firm grip . He was making signals , and we realized he wanted to tell me something . We put a pad of paper in his hand and he wrote Semper Fi . Well , if you have been a marine or if , like myself , you are an admirer of the marines , you know those words are a battle cry , a greeting , and a legend in the Marine Corps . They are marine shorthand for the motto of the Corps Semper Fidelis always faithful . General Kelley has a reputation for being a very sophisticated general and a very tough marine . But he cried when he saw those words , and who can blame him That marine and all those others like him , living and dead , have been faithful to their ideals . They have given willingly of themselves so that a nearly defenseless people in a region of great strategic importance to the free world will have a chance someday to live lives free of murder and mayhem and terrorism . I think that young marine and all of his comrades have given every one of us something to live up to . They were not afraid to stand up for their country or , no matter how difficult and slow the journey might be , to give to others that last , best hope of a better future . We cannot and will not dishonor them now and the sacrifices they have made by failing to remain as faithful to the cause of freedom and the pursuit of peace as they have been . I will not ask you to pray for the dead , because they are safe in God s loving arms and beyond need of our prayers . I would like to ask you all wherever you may be in this blessed land to pray for these wounded young men and to pray for the bereaved families of those who gave their lives for our freedom . God bless you , and God bless America . My fellow Americans Some two months ago we were shocked by the brutal massacre of 269 men , women , and children , more than 60 of them Americans , in the shooting down of a Korean airliner . Now , in these past several days , violence has erupted again , in Lebanon and Grenada . In Lebanon , we have some 1 , 600 marines , part of a multinational force that is trying to help the people of Lebanon restore order and stability to that troubled land . Our marines are assigned to the south of the city of Beirut , near the only airport operating in Lebanon . Just a mile or so to the north is the Italian contingent and not far from them , the French and a company of British soldiers . This past Sunday , at 22 minutes after 6 Beirut time , with dawn just breaking , a truck , looking like a lot of other vehicles in the city , approached the airport on a busy , main road . There was nothing in its appearance to suggest it was any different than the trucks or cars that were normally seen on and around the airport . But this one was different . At the wheel was a young man on a suicide mission . The truck carried some 2 , 000 pounds of explosives , but there was no way our marine guards could know this . Their first warning that something was wrong came when the truck crashed through a series of barriers , including a chain link fence and barbed wire entanglements . The guards opened fire , but it was too late . The truck smashed through the doors of the headquarters building in which our marines were sleeping and instantly exploded . The four story concrete building collapsed in a pile of rubble . More than 200 of the sleeping men were killed in that one hideous , insane attack . Many others suffered injury and are hospitalized here or in Europe . This was not the end of the horror . At almost the same instant , another vehicle on a suicide and murder mission crashed into the headquarters of the French peacekeeping force , an eight story building , destroying it and killing more than 50 French soldiers . Prior to this day of horror , there had been several tragedies for our men in the multinational force . Attacks by snipers and mortar fire had taken their toll . I called bereaved parents and or widows of the victims to express on behalf of all of us our sorrow and sympathy . Sometimes there were questions . And now many of you are asking Why should our young men be dying in Lebanon Why is Lebanon important to us Well , it is true , Lebanon is a small country , more than five and a half thousand miles from our shores on the edge of what we call the Middle East . But every President who has occupied this office in recent years has recognized that peace in the Middle East is of vital concern to our nation and , indeed , to our allies in Western Europe and Japan . We have been concerned because the Middle East is a powderkeg four times in the last 30 years , the Arabs and Israelis have gone to war . And each time , the world has teetered near the edge of catastrophe . The area is key to the economic and political life of the West . Its strategic importance , its energy resources , the Suez Canal , and the well being of the nearly 200 million people living there all are vital to us and to world peace . If that key should fall into the hands of a power or powers hostile to the free world , there would be a direct threat to the United States and to our allies . We have another reason to be involved . Since 1948 our Nation has recognized and accepted a moral obligation to assure the continued existence of Israel as a nation . Israel shares our democratic values and is a formidable force an invader of the Middle East would have to reckon with . For several years , Lebanon has been torn by internal strife . Once a prosperous , peaceful nation , its government had become ineffective in controlling the militias that warred on each other . Sixteen months ago , we were watching on our TV screens the shelling and bombing of Beirut which was being used as a fortress by PLO bands . Hundreds and hundreds of civilians were being killed and wounded in the daily battles . Syria , which makes no secret of its claim that Lebanon should be a part of a Greater Syria , was occupying a large part of Lebanon . Today , Syria has become a home for 7 , 000 Soviet advisers and technicians who man a massive amount of Soviet weaponry , including SS 21 ground to ground missiles capable of reaching vital areas of Israel . A little over a year ago , hoping to build on the Camp David accords , which had led to peace between Israel and Egypt , I proposed a peace plan for the Middle East to end the wars between the Arab States and Israel . It was based on resolutions 242 and 338 and called for a fair and just solution to the Palestinian problem , as well as a fair and just settlement of issues between the Arab States and Israel . Before the necessary negotiations could begin , it was essential to get all foreign forces out of Lebanon and to end the fighting there . So , why are we there Well , the answer is straightforward to help bring peace to Lebanon and stability to the vital Middle East . To that end , the multinational force was created to help stabilize the situation in Lebanon until a government could be established and a Lebanese army mobilized to restore Lebanese sovereignty over its own soil as the foreign forces withdrew . Israel agreed to withdraw as did Syria , but Syria then reneged on its promise . Over 10 , 000 Palestinians who had been bringing ruin down on Beirut , however , did leave the country . Lebanon has formed a government under the leadership of President Gemayal , and that government , with our assistance and training , has set up its own army . In only a year s time , that army has been rebuilt . It is a good army , composed of Lebanese of all factions . A few weeks ago , the Israeli army pulled back to the Awali River in southern Lebanon . Despite fierce resistance by Syrian backed forces , the Lebanese army was able to hold the line and maintain the defensive perimeter around Beirut . In the year that our marines have been there , Lebanon has made important steps toward stability and order . The physical presence of the marines lends support to both the Lebanese Government and its army . It allows the hard work of diplomacy to go forward . Indeed , without the peacekeepers from the S . , France , Italy , and Britain , the efforts to find a peaceful solution in Lebanon would collapse . As to that narrower question what exactly is the operational mission of the marines the answer is , to secure a piece of Beirut , to keep order in their sector , and to prevent the area from becoming a battlefield . Our marines are not just sitting in an airport . Part of their task is to guard that airport . Because of their presence , the airport has remained operational . In addition , they patrol the surrounding area . This is their part a limited , but essential part in the larger effort that I have described . If our marines must be there , I am asked , why cannot we make them safer Who committed this latest atrocity against them and why Well , we will do everything we can to ensure that our men are as safe as possible . We ordered the battleship New Jersey to join our naval forces offshore . Without even firing them , the threat of its 16 inch guns silenced those who once fired down on our marines from the hills , and they are a good part of the reason we suddenly had a ceasefire . We are doing our best to make our forces less vulnerable to those who want to snipe at them or send in future suicide missions . Secretary Shultz called me today from Europe , where he was meeting with the Foreign Ministers of our allies in the multinational force . They remain committed to our task . And plans were made to share information as to how we can improve security for all our men . We have strong circumstantial evidence that the attack on the marines was directed by terrorists who used the same method to destroy our Embassy in Beirut . Those who directed this atrocity must be dealt justice , and they will be . The obvious purpose behind the sniping and , now , this attack was to weaken American will and force the withdrawal of and French forces from Lebanon . The clear intent of the terrorists was to eliminate our support of the Lebanese Government and to destroy the ability of the Lebanese people to determine their own destiny . To answer those who ask if we are serving any purpose in being there , let me answer a question with a question . Would the terrorists have launched their suicide attacks against the multinational force if it were not doing its job The multinational force was attacked precisely because it is doing the job it was sent to do in Beirut . It is accomplishing its mission . Now then , where do we go from here What can we do now to help Lebanon gain greater stability so that our marines can come home Well , I believe we can take three steps now that will make a difference . First , we will accelerate the search for peace and stability in that region . Little attention has been paid to the fact that we have had special envoys there working , literally , around the clock to bring the warring factions together . This coming Monday in Geneva , President Gemayel of Lebanon will sit down with other factions from his country to see if national reconciliation can be achieved . He has our firm support . I will soon be announcing a replacement for Bud McFarlane , who was preceded by Phil Habib . Both worked tirelessly and must be credited for much if not most of the progress we have made . Second , we will work even more closely with our allies in providing support for the Government of Lebanon and for the rebuilding of a national consensus . Third , we will ensure that the multinational peace keeping forces , our marines , are given the greatest possible protection . Our Commandant of the Marine Corps , General Kelley , returned from Lebanon today and will be advising us on steps we can take to improve security . Vice President Bush returned just last night from Beirut and gave me a full report of his brief visit . Beyond our progress in Lebanon , let us remember that our main goal and purpose is to achieve a broader peace in all of the Middle East . The factions and bitterness that we see in Lebanon are just a microcosm of the difficulties that are spread across much of that region . A peace initiative for the entire Middle East , consistent with the Camp David accords and resolutions 242 and 338 , still offers the best hope for bringing peace to the region . Let me ask those who say we should get out of Lebanon If we were to leave Lebanon now , what message would that send to those who foment instability and terrorism If America were to walk away from Lebanon , what chance would there be for a negotiated settlement , producing a unified democratic Lebanon If we turned our backs on Lebanon now , what would be the future of Israel At stake is the fate of only the second Arab country to negotiate a major agreement with Israel . That is another accomplishment of this past year , the May 17th accord signed by Lebanon and Israel . If terrorism and intimidation succeed , it will be a devastating blow to the peace process and to Israel s search for genuine security . It will not just be Lebanon sentenced to a future of chaos . Can the United States , or the free world , for that matter , stand by and see the Middle East incorporated into the Soviet bloc What of Western Europe and Japan s dependence on Middle East oil for the energy to fuel their industries The Middle East is , as I have said , vital to our national security and economic well being . Brave young men have been taken from us . Many others have been grievously wounded . Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted They gave their lives in defense of our national security every bit as much as any man who ever died fighting in a war . We must not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from their courageous sacrifice . We are a nation with global responsibilities . We are not somewhere else in the world protecting someone else s interests we are there protecting our own . I received a message from the father of a marine in Lebanon . He told me , In a world where we speak of human rights , there is a sad lack of acceptance of responsibility . My son has chosen the acceptance of responsibility for the privilege of living in this country . Certainly in this country one does not inherently have rights unless the responsibility for these rights is accepted . Kenneth Morrison said that while he was waiting to learn if his son was one of the dead . I was thrilled for him to learn today that his son Ross is alive and well and carrying on his duties in Lebanon . Let us meet our responsibilities . For longer than any of us can remember , the people of the Middle East have lived from war to war with no prospect for any other future . That dreadful cycle must be broken . Why are we there Well , a Lebanese mother told one of our Ambassadors that her little girl had only attended school 2 of the last 8 years . Now , because of our presence there , she said her daughter could live a normal life . With patience and firmness , we can help bring peace to that strife torn region and make our own lives more secure . Our role is to help the Lebanese put their country together , not to do it for them . Now , I know another part of the world is very much on our minds , a place much closer to our shores Grenada . The island is only twice the size of the District of Columbia , with a total population of about 110 , 000 people . Grenada and a half dozen other Caribbean islands here were , until recently , British colonies . They are now independent states and members of the British Commonwealth . While they respect each other s independence , they also feel a kinship with each other and think of themselves as one people . In 1979 trouble came to Grenada . Maurice Bishop , a protege of Fidel Castro , staged a military coup and overthrew the government which had been elected under the constitution left to the people by the British . He sought the help of Cuba in building an airport , which he claimed was for tourist trade , but which looked suspiciously suitable for military aircraft , including Soviet built long range bombers . The six sovereign countries and one remaining colony are joined together in what they call the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States . The six became increasingly alarmed as Bishop built an army greater than all of theirs combined . Obviously , it was not purely for defense . In this last year or so , Prime Minister Bishop gave indications that he might like better relations with the United States . He even made a trip to our country and met with senior officials of the White House and the State Department . Whether he was serious or not , we will never know . On October 12th , a small group in his militia seized him and put him under arrest . They were , if anything , more radical and more devoted to Castro s Cuba than he had been . Several days later , a crowd of citizens appeared before Bishop s home , freed him , and escorted him toward the headquarters of the military council . They were fired upon . A number , including some children , were killed , and Bishop was seized . He and several members of his cabinet were subsequently executed , and a 24 hour shoot to kill curfew was put in effect . Grenada was without a government , its only authority exercised by a self proclaimed band of military men . There were then about 1 , 000 of our citizens on Grenada , 800 of them students in George s University Medical School . Concerned that they had be harmed or held as hostages , I ordered a flotilla of ships , then on its way to Lebanon with marines , part of our regular rotation program , to circle south on a course that would put them somewhere in the vicinity of Grenada in case there should be a need to evacuate our people . Last weekend , I was awakened in the early morning hours and told that six members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States , joined by Jamaica and Barbados , had sent an urgent request that we join them in a military operation to restore order and democracy to Grenada . They were proposing this action under the terms of a treaty , a mutual assistance pact that existed among them . These small , peaceful nations needed our help . Three of them do not have armies at all , and the others have very limited forces . The legitimacy of their request , plus my own concern for our citizens , dictated my decision . I believe our government has a responsibility to go to the aid of its citizens , if their right to life and liberty is threatened . The nightmare of our hostages in Iran must never be repeated . We knew we had little time and that complete secrecy was vital to ensure both the safety of the young men who would undertake this mission and the Americans they were about to rescue . The Joint Chiefs worked around the clock to come up with a plan . They had little intelligence information about conditions on the island . We had to assume that several hundred Cubans working on the airport could be military reserves . Well , as it turned out , the number was much larger , and they were a military force . Six hundred of them have been taken prisoner , and we have discovered a complete base with weapons and communications equipment , which makes it clear a Cuban occupation of the island had been planned . Two hours ago we released the first photos from Grenada . They included pictures of a warehouse of military equipment one of three we have uncovered so far . This warehouse contained weapons and ammunition stacked almost to the ceiling , enough to supply thousands of terrorists . Grenada , we were told , was a friendly island paradise for tourism . Well , it was not . It was a Soviet Cuban colony , being readied as a major military bastion to export terror and undermine democracy . We got there just in time . I cannot say enough in praise of our military Army rangers and paratroopers , Navy , Marine , and Air Force personnel those who planned a brilliant campaign and those who carried it out . Almost instantly , our military seized the two airports , secured the campus where most of our students were , and are now in the mopping up phase . It should be noted that in all the planning , a top priority was to minimize risk , to avoid casualties to our own men and also the Grenadian forces as much as humanly possible . But there were casualties , and we all owe a debt to those who lost their lives or were wounded . They were few in number , but even one is a tragic price to pay . It is our intention to get our men out as soon as possible . Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica I called that wrong she pronounces it Dominica she is Chairman of OECShe is calling for help from Commonwealth nations in giving the people their right to establish a constitutional government on Grenada . We anticipate that the Governor General , a Grenadian , will participate in setting up a provisional government in the interim . The events in Lebanon and Grenada , though oceans apart , are closely related . Not only has Moscow assisted and encouraged the violence in both countries , but it provides direct support through a network of surrogates and terrorists . It is no coincidence that when the thugs tried to wrest control over Grenada , there were 30 Soviet advisers and hundreds of Cuban military and paramilitary forces on the island . At the moment of our landing , we communicated with the Governments of Cuba and the Soviet Union and told them we would offer shelter and security to their people on Grenada . Regrettably , Castro ordered his men to fight to the death , and some did . The others will be sent to their homelands . You know , there was a time when our national security was based on a standing army here within our own borders and shore batteries of artillery along our coasts , and , of course , a navy to keep the sealanes open for the shipping of things necessary to our well being . The world has changed . Today , our national security can be threatened in faraway places . It is up to all of us to be aware of the strategic importance of such places and to be able to identify them . Sam Rayburn once said that freedom is not something a nation can work for once and win forever . He said it is like an insurance policy its premiums must be kept up to date . In order to keep it , we have to keep working for it and sacrificing for it just as long as we live . If we do not , our children may not know the pleasure of working to keep it , for it may not be theirs to keep . In these last few days , I have been more sure than I have ever been that we Americans of today will keep freedom and maintain peace . I have been made to feel that by the magnificent spirit of our young men and women in uniform and by something here in our Nation s Capital . In this city , where political strife is so much a part of our lives , I have seen Democratic leaders in the Congress join their Republican colleagues , send a message to the world that we are all Americans before we are anything else , and when our country is threatened , we stand shoulder to shoulder in support of our men and women in the Armed Forces . May I share something with you I think you had like to know It is something that happened to the Commandant of our Marine Corps , General Paul Kelley , while he was visiting our critically injured marines in an Air Force hospital . It says more than any of us could ever hope to say about the gallantry and heroism of these young men , young men who serve so willingly so that others might have a chance at peace and freedom in their own lives and in the life of their country .

We put a pad of paper in his hand and he wrote Semper Fi . Well , if you have been a marine or if , like myself , you are an admirer of the marines , you know those words are a battle cry , a greeting , and a legend in the Marine Corps . They are marine shorthand for the motto of the Corps Semper Fidelis always faithful . General Kelley has a reputation for being a very sophisticated general and a very tough marine . But he cried when he saw those words , and who can blame him That marine and all those others like him , living and dead , have been faithful to their ideals . They have given willingly of themselves so that a nearly defenseless people in a region of great strategic importance to the free world will have a chance someday to live lives free of murder and mayhem and terrorism . I think that young marine and all of his comrades have given every one of us something to live up to . They were not afraid to stand up for their country or , no matter how difficult and slow the journey might be , to give to others that last , best hope of a better future . We cannot and will not dishonor them now and the sacrifices they have made by failing to remain as faithful to the cause of freedom and the pursuit of peace as they have been . I will not ask you to pray for the dead , because they are safe in God s loving arms and beyond need of our prayers . I would like to ask you all wherever you may be in this blessed land to pray for these wounded young men and to pray for the bereaved families of those who gave their lives for our freedom . God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , distinguished Members of the Congress , honored guests , and fellow citizens Thank you for allowing me to delay my address until this evening . We paused together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven Challenger heroes . And I hope that we are now ready to do what they would want us to do Go forward , America , and reach for the stars . We will never forget those brave seven , but we shall go forward . Speaker , before I begin my prepared remarks , may I point out that tonight marks the 10th and last State of the Union Message that you have presided over . And on behalf of the American people , I want to salute you for your service to Congress and country . Here s to you I have come to review with you the progress of our nation , to speak of unfinished work , and to set our sights on the future . I am pleased to report the state of our Union is stronger than a year ago and growing stronger each day . Tonight we look out on a rising America , firm of heart , united in spirit , powerful in pride and patriotism . America is on the move But it was not long ago that we looked out on a different land locked factory gates , long gasoline lines , intolerable prices , and interest rates turning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams . Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant , slamming shut the gates of opportunity , threatening to crush the very roots of our freedom . What brought America back The American people brought us back with quiet courage and common sense , with undying faith that in this nation under God the future will be ours for the future belongs to the free . Tonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of economic growth , for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9 million new jobs in 3 years , interest rates cut in half , inflation falling over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today , and a mighty river of good works a record 74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone . And despite the pressures of our modern world , family and community remain the moral core of our society , guardians of our values and hopes for the future . Family and community are the costars of this great American comeback . They are why we say tonight Private values must be at the heart of public policies . What is true for families in America is true for America in the family of free nations . History is no captive of some inevitable force . History is made by men and women of vision and courage . Tonight freedom is on the march . The United States is the economic miracle , the model to which the world once again turns . We stand for an idea whose time is now Only by lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and can peace among all nations be secure . Teddy Roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever . We have done well , but we cannot stop at the foothills when Everest beckons . It is time for America to be all that we can be . We speak tonight of an agenda for the future , an agenda for a safer , more secure world . And we speak about the necessity for actions to steel us for the challenges of growth , trade , and security in the next decade and the year 2000 . And we will do it not by breaking faith with bedrock principles but by breaking free from failed policies . Let us begin where storm clouds loom darkest right here in Washington , DThis week I will send you our detailed proposals tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government s role not to control , not to demand or command , not to contain us , but to help in times of need and , above all , to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that all Americans can climb toward economic power and justice on their own . But we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that cannot even pass a Federal budget . We cannot win that race held back by horse and buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human potential . We cannot win that race if we are swamped in a sea of red ink . Now , Speaker , you know , I know , and the American people know the Federal budget system is broken . It does not work . Before we leave this city , let us you and I work together to fix it , and then we can finally give the American people a balanced budget . Members of Congress , passage of Gramm Rudman Hollings gives us an historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades forcing the Federal Government to live within its means . Your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th , the very day America s families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce . How often we read of a husband and wife both working , struggling from paycheck to paycheck to raise a family , meet a mortgage , pay their taxes and bills . And yet some in Congress say taxes must be raised . Well , I am sorry they are asking the wrong people to tighten their belts . It is time we reduce the Federal budget and left the family budget alone . We do not face large deficits because American families are undertaxed we face those deficits because the Federal Government overspends . The detailed budget that we will submit will meet the Gramm Rudman Hollings target for deficit reductions , meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense , meet our commitment to protect Social Security and the truly less fortunate , and , yes , meet our commitment to not raise taxes . How should we accomplish this Well , not by taking from those in need . As families take care of their own , government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves . But we must revise or replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work , encourage family breakups , and drive entire communities into a bleak and heartless dependency . Gramm Rudman Hollings can mark a dramatic improvement . But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they will be met . We must proceed with Grace commission reforms against waste . And tonight I ask you to give me what 43 Governors have Give me a line item veto this year . Give me the authority to veto waste , and I will take the responsibility , I will make the cuts , I will take the heat . This authority would not give me any monopoly power , but simply prevent spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit . And you can sustain or override my veto that is the way the system should work . Once we have made the hard choices , we should lock in our gains with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution . I mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense . We must meet it . Defense is not just another budget expense . Keeping America strong , free , and at peace is solely the responsibility of the Federal Government it is government s prime responsibility . We have devoted 5 years trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect , and we have made important gains . Yet the threat from Soviet forces , conventional and strategic , from the Soviet drive for domination , from the increase in espionage and state terror remains great . This is reality . Closing our eyes will not make reality disappear . We pledged together to hold real growth in defense spending to the bare minimum . My budget honors that pledge , and I am now asking you , the Congress , to keep its end of the bargain . The Soviets must know that if America reduces her defenses , it will be because of a reduced threat , not a reduced resolve . Keeping America strong is as vital to the national security as controlling Federal spending is to our economic security . But , as I have said before , the most powerful force we can enlist against the Federal deficit is an ever expanding American economy , unfettered and free . The magic of opportunity unreserved , unfailing , unrestrained is not this the calling that unites us I believe our tax rate cuts for the people have done more to spur a spirit of risk taking and help America s economy break free than any program since John Kennedy s tax cut almost a quarter century ago . Now history calls us to press on , to complete efforts for an historic tax reform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay their fair share , but no more . We have come this far . Will you join me now , and we will walk this last mile together You know my views on this . We cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise . True reform must be an engine of productivity and growth , and that means a top personal rate no higher than 35 percent . True reform must be truly fair , and that means raising personal exemptions to 2 , 000 . True reform means a tax system that at long last is profamily , projobs , profuture , and pro America . As we knock down the barriers to growth , we must redouble our efforts for freer and fairer trade . We have already taken actions to counter unfair trading practices and to pry open closed foreign markets . We will continue to do so . We will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection that in reality pits one American worker against another , one industry against another , one community against another , and that raises prices for us all . If the United States can trade with other nations on a level playing field , we can outproduce , outcompete , and outsell anybody , anywhere in the world . The constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world . We must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other exporters . Farmers , in particular , have suffered from past unwise government policies . They must not be abandoned with problems they did not create and cannot control . We have begun coordinating economic and monetary policy among our major trading partners . But there is more to do , and tonight I am directing Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to determine if the nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our currencies . Confident in our future and secure in our values , Americans are striving forward to embrace the future . We see it not only in our recovery but in 3 straight years of falling crime rates , as families and communities band together to fight pornography , drugs , and lawlessness and to give back to their children the safe and , yes , innocent childhood they deserve . We see it in the renaissance in education , the rising SAT scores for three years last year s increase , the greatest since 1963 . It was not government and Washington lobbies that turned education around it was the American people who , in reaching for excellence , knew to reach back to basics . We must continue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools , vouchers that give parents freedom of choice and we must give back to our children their lost right to acknowledge God in their classrooms . We are a nation of idealists , yet today there is a wound in our national conscience . America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn . For the rest of my time , I shall do what I can to see that this wound is one day healed . As we work to make the American dream real for all , we must also look to the condition of America s families . Struggling parents today worry how they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave them . In the welfare culture , the breakdown of the family , the most basic support system , has reached crisis proportions female and child poverty , child abandonment , horrible crimes , and deteriorating schools . After hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs , the plight of the poor grows more painful . But the waste in dollars and cents pales before the most tragic loss the sinful waste of human spirit and potential . We can ignore this terrible truth no longer . As Franklin Roosevelt warned 51 years ago , standing before this Chamber , he said , Welfare is a narcotic , a subtle destroyer of the human spirit . And we must now escape the spider s web of dependency . Tonight I am charging the White House Domestic Council to present me by December 1 , 1986 , an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate action to meet the financial , educational , social , and safety concerns of poor families . I am talking about real and lasting emancipation , because the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare . Further , after seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family , I am directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services , Otis Bowen , to report to me by year end with recommendations on how the private sector and government can work together to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes . And tonight I want to speak directly to America s younger generation , because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands . With all the temptations young people face , it sometimes seems the allure of the permissive society requires superhuman feats of self control . But the call of the future is too strong , the challenge too great to get lost in the blind alleyways of dissolution , drugs , and despair . Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive , a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement . As they said in the film Back to the Future , Where we are going , we do not need roads . Well , today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith . Astronomers build a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and possibly back to the moment of creation . So , yes , this nation remains fully committed to America s space program . We are going forward with our shuttle flights . We are going forward to build our space station . And we are going forward with research on a new Orient Express that could , by the end of the next decade , take off from Dulles Airport , accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound , attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within 2 hours . And the same technology transforming our lives can solve the greatest problem of the 20th century . A security shield can one day render nuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror . America met one historic challenge and went to the Moon . Now America must meet another to make our strategic defense real for all the citizens of planet Earth . Let us speak of our deepest longing for the future to leave our children a land that is free and just and a world at peace . It is my hope that our fireside summit in Geneva and Gorbachev s upcoming visit to America can lead to a more stable relationship . Surely no people on Earth hate war or love peace more than we Americans . But we cannot stroll into the future with childlike faith . Our differences with a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged right to command people s lives and to export its ideology by force are deep and abiding . Logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by realism rock hard , cleareyed , steady , and sure . Our negotiators in Geneva have proposed a radical cut in offensive forces by each side with no cheating . They have made clear that Soviet compliance with the letter and spirit of agreements is essential . If the Soviet Government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms , there will be such an agreement . But arms control is no substitute for peace . We know that peace follows in freedom s path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied . So , we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by bolstering prosperity , liberty , and democracy however and wherever we can . We advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf of lower tax rates , freer markets , sound currencies around the world . We strengthen the family of freedom every time we work with allies and come to the aid of friends under siege . And we can enlarge the family of free nations if we will defend the unalienable rights of all God s children to follow their dreams . To those imprisoned in regimes held captive , to those beaten for daring to fight for freedom and democracy for their right to worship , to speak , to live , and to prosper in the family of free nations we say to you tonight You are not alone , freedom fighters . America will support with moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die for freedom but to fight and win freedom to win freedom in Afghanistan , in Angola , in Cambodia , and in Nicaragua . This is a great moral challenge for the entire free world . Surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere , for the security of our frontiers , for the protection of our vital interests , than to achieve democracy in Nicaragua and to protect Nicaragua s democratic neighbors . This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do what must be done for that great and good cause . As Scoop Jackson , the inspiration for our Bipartisan Commission on Central America , once said , In matters of national security , the best politics is no politics . What we accomplish this year , in each challenge we face , will set our course for the balance of the decade , indeed , for the remainder of the century . After all we have done so far , let no one say that this nation cannot reach the destiny of our dreams . America believes , America is ready , America can win the race to the future and we shall . The American dream is a song of hope that rings through night winter air vivid , tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest things to venture a daring enterprise to unearth new beauty in music , literature , and art to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell . We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard Cavoli . All his life he is been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine . And , Richard , we know that the experiment that you began in high school was launched and lost last week , yet your dream lives . And as long as it is real , work of noble note will yet be done , work that could reduce the harmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the golden gateways of the farthest stars . We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12 year old , Tyrone Ford . A child prodigy of gospel music , he has surmounted personal adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer . He also directs the choirs of three churches and has performed at the Kennedy Center . With God as your composer , Tyrone , your music will be the music of angels . We see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13 year old Shelby Butler , honor student and member of her school s safety patrol . Seeing another girl freeze in terror before an out of control school bus , she risked her life and pulled her to safety . With bravery like yours , Shelby , America need never fear for our future . And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13 year old , Trevor Ferrell . Two years ago , age 11 , watching men and women bedding down in abandoned doorways on television he was watching Trevor left his suburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless and homeless . And now 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil . Trevor , yours is the living spirit of brotherly love . Would you four stand up for a moment Thank you , thank you . You are heroes of our hearts . We look at you and know it is true In this land of dreams fulfilled , where greater dreams may be imagined , nothing is impossible , no victory is beyond our reach , no glory will ever be too great . So , now it is up to us , all of us , to prepare America for that day when our work will pale before the greatness of America s champions in the 21st century . The world s hopes rest with America s future America s hopes rest with us . So , let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith , in unity , and in love . God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , distinguished Members of the Congress , honored guests , and fellow citizens Today marks my first State of the Union address to you , a constitutional duty as old as our Republic itself . President Washington began this tradition in 1790 after reminding the Nation that the destiny of self government and the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty is finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people . For our friends in the press , who place a high premium on accuracy , let me say I did not actually hear George Washington say that . But it is a matter of historic record . But from this podium , Winston Churchill asked the free world to stand together against the onslaught of aggression . Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke of a day of infamy and summoned a nation to arms . Douglas MacArthur made an unforgettable farewell to a country he loved and served so well . Dwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of strength . And John Kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that is freedom . When I visited this Chamber last year as a newcomer to Washington , critical of past policies which I believed had failed , I proposed a new spirit of partnership between this Congress and this administration and between Washington and our State and local governments . In forging this new partnership for America , we could achieve the oldest hopes of our Republic prosperity for our nation , peace for the world , and the blessings of individual liberty for our children and , someday , for all of humanity . It is my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in our relations with other nations , on the foundation we have carefully laid for our economic recovery , and finally , on a bold and spirited initiative that I believe can change the face of American government and make it again the servant of the people . Seldom have the stakes been higher for America . What we do and say here will make all the difference to autoworkers in Detroit , lumberjacks in the Northwest , steelworkers in Steubenville who are in the unemployment lines to black teenagers in Newark and Chicago to hard pressed farmers and small businessmen and to millions of everyday Americans who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their children . To understand the state of the Union , we must look not only at where we are and where we are going but where we have been . The situation at this time last year was truly ominous . The last decade has seen a series of recessions . There was a recession in 1970 , in 1974 , and again in the spring of 1980 . Each time , unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again . We coined the word stagflation to describe this . Government s response to these recessions was to pump up the money supply and increase spending . In the last 6 months of 1980 , as an example , the money supply increased at the fastest rate in postwar history 13 percent . Inflation remained in double digits , and government spending increased at an annual rate of 17 percent . Interest rates reached a staggering 21 . 5 percent . There were 8 million unemployed . Late in 1981 we sank into the present recession , largely because continued high interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction . And there was a drop in productivity , and the already high unemployment increased . This time , however , things are different . We have an economic program in place , completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past . It calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending , and already that rate has been cut nearly in half . But reduced spending the first and smallest phase of a 3 year tax rate reduction designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs . Already interest rates are down to 15 3 4 percent , but they must still go lower . Inflation is down from 12 . 4 percent to 8 . 9 , and for the month of December it was running at an annualized rate of 5 . 2 percent . If we had not acted as we did , things would be far worse for all Americans than they are today . Inflation , taxes , and interest rates would all be higher . A year ago , Americans faith in their governmental process was steadily declining . Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic about their future . A new kind of defeatism was heard . Some said our domestic problems were uncontrollable , that we had to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment . There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our administration and this Congress . It was said we could never work together . Well , those predictions were wrong . The record is clear , and I believe that history will remember this as an era of American renewal , remember this administration as an administration of change , and remember this Congress as a Congress of destiny . Together , we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly in half , we brought about the largest tax reductions and the most sweeping changes in our tax structure since the beginning of this century . And because we indexed future taxes to the rate of inflation , we took away government s built in profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to grow larger at the expense of American workers . Together , after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the people in their States and local communities , we have started returning power and resources to them . Together , we have cut the growth of new Federal regulations nearly in half . In 1981 there were 23 , 000 fewer pages in the Federal Register , which lists new regulations , than there were in 1980 . By deregulating oil we have come closer to achieving energy independence and helped bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel . Together , we have created an effective Federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government . In just 6 months it has saved the taxpayers more than 2 billion , and it is only getting started . Together we have begun to mobilize the private sector , not to duplicate wasteful and discredited government programs , but to bring thousands of Americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America s social problems . Together we have begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures peace . Our country s uniform is being worn once again with pride . Together we have made a New Beginning , but we have only begun . No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy . In my Inaugural Address last year , I warned that the ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades . They will not go away in days , weeks , or months , but they will go away . . . because we as Americans have the capacity now , as we have had it in the past , to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom . The economy will face difficult moments in the months ahead . But the program for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the latter half of this year . And that is why I can report to you tonight that in the near future the state of the Union and the economy will be better much better if we summon the strength to continue on the course that we have charted . And so , the question If the fundamentals are in place , what now Well , two things . First , we must understand what is happening at the moment to the economy . Our current problems are not the product of the recovery program that is only just now getting underway , as some would have you believe they are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend . Second , because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fixes , we must stick to our carefully integrated plan for recovery . That plan is based on four commonsense fundamentals continued reduction of the growth in Federal spending preserving the individual and business tax reductions that will stimulate saving and investment removing unnecessary Federal regulations to spark productivity and maintaining a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy , the latter a responsibility of the Federal Reserve System . The only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return to the policies that gave us a trillion dollar debt , runaway inflation , runaway interest rates and unemployment . The doubters would have us turn back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate reductions already passed by this Congress . Raise present taxes to cut future deficits , they tell us . Well , I do not believe we should buy that argument . There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or surpluses several years ahead with any degree of accuracy . The budget in place , when I took office , had been projected as balanced . It turned out to have one of the biggest deficits in history . Another example of the imponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionable a change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by some 25 billion . As it now stands , our forecast , which we are required by law to make , will show major deficits starting at less than a hundred billion dollars and declining , but still too high . More important , we are making progress with the three keys to reducing deficits economic growth , lower interest rates , and spending control . The policies we have in place will reduce the deficit steadily , surely , and in time , completely . Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits . If they did , how would we explain that tax revenues more than doubled just since 1976 yet in that same 6 year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history . In 1980 tax revenues increased by 54 billion , and in 1980 we had one of our all time biggest deficits . Raising taxes will not balance the budget it will encourage more government spending and less private investment . Raising taxes will slow economic growth , reduce production , and destroy future jobs , making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them and more likely that those who now have jobs could lose them . So , I will not ask you to try to balance the budget on the backs of the American taxpayers . I will seek no tax increases this year , and I have no intention of retreating from our basic program of tax relief . I promise to bring the American people to bring their tax rates down and to keep them down , to provide them incentives to rebuild our economy , to save , to invest in America s future . I will stand by my word . Tonight I am urging the American people Seize these new opportunities to produce , to save , to invest , and together we will make this economy a mighty engine of freedom , hope , and prosperity again . Now , the budget deficit this year will exceed our earlier expectations . The recession did that . It lowered revenues and increased costs . To some extent , we are also victims of our own success . We have brought inflation down faster than we thought we could , and in doing this , we have deprived government of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes people into higher income tax brackets . And the continued high interest rates last year cost the government about 5 billion more than anticipated . We must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more waste , and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of employees in the Federal work force by 75 , 000 . The budget plan I submit to you on February 8th will realize major savings by dismantling the Departments of Energy and Education and by eliminating ineffective subsidies for business . We will continue to redirect our resources to our two highest budget priorities a strong national defense to keep America free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social programs for those who have contributed and those who are in need . Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard , this administration has not and will not turn its back on America s elderly or America s poor . Under the new budget , funding for social insurance programs will be more than double the amount spent only 6 years ago . But it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient and economical . The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goals and many deserving recipients . We will protect them . But there is only one way to see to it that these programs really help those whom they were designed to help . And that is to bring their spiraling costs under control . Today we face the absurd situation of a Federal budget with three quarters of its expenditures routinely referred to as uncontrollable . And a large part of this goes to entitlement programs . Committee after committee of this Congress has heard witness after witness describe many of these programs as poorly administered and rife with waste and fraud . Virtually every American who shops in a local supermarket is aware of the daily abuses that take place in the food stamp program , which has grown by 16 , 000 percent in the last 15 years . Another example is Medicare and Medicaid programs with worthy goals but whose costs have increased from 11 . 2 billion to almost 60 billion , more than 5 times as much , in just 10 years . Waste and fraud are serious problems . Back in 1980 Federal investigators testified before one of your committees that corruption has permeated virtually every area of the Medicare and Medicaid health care industry . One official said many of the people who are cheating the system were very confident that nothing was going to happen to them . Well , something is going to happen . Not only the taxpayers are defrauded the people with real dependency on these programs are deprived of what they need , because available resources are going not to the needy , but to the greedy . The time has come to control the uncontrollable . In August we made a start . I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by 44 billion over the next 3 years while at the same time preserving essential services for the truly needy . Shortly you will receive from me a message on further reforms we intend to install some new , but others long recommended by your own congressional committees . I ask you to help make these savings for the American taxpayer . The savings we propose in entitlement programs will total some 63 billion over 4 Years and will , without affecting social t security , go a long way toward bringing Federal spending under control . But do not be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprive the elderly , the needy , and the helpless . The . Federal Government will still subsidize 95 million meals every day . That is one out of seven of all the meals served in America . Head Start , senior nutrition programs , and child welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed last year . More than one half billion dollars has been proposed for minority business assistance . And research at the National Institute of Health will be increased by over 100 million . While meeting all these needs , we intend to plug unwarranted tax loopholes and strengthen the law which requires all large corporations to pay a minimum tax . I am confident the economic program we have put into operation will protect the needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all Americans . It will stimulate the economy , result in increased savings and provide capital for expansion , mortgages for homebuilding , and jobs for the unemployed . Now that the essentials of that program are in place , our next major undertaking must be a program just as bold , just as innovative to make government again accountable to the people , to make our system of federalism work again . Our citizens feel they have lost control of even the most basic decisions made about the essential services of government , such as schools , welfare , roads , and even garbage collection . And they are right . A maze of interlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average citizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems . They do not know where to turn for answers , who to hold accountable , who to praise , who to blame , who to vote for or against . The main reason for this is the overpowering growth of Federal grants in aid programs during the past few decades . In 1960 the Federal Government had 132 categorical grant programs , costing 7 billion . When I took office , there were approximately 500 , costing nearly a hundred billion dollars 13 programs for energy , 36 for pollution control , 66 for social services , 90 for education . And here in the Congress , it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of them . You know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress can properly oversee this jungle of grants in aid indeed , the growth of these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government . As one Democratic Governor put it recently The National Government should be worrying about arms control , not potholes . The growth in these Federal programs has in the words of one intergovernmental commission made the Federal Government more pervasive , more intrusive , more unmanageable , more ineffective and costly , and above all , more accountable . Let us solve this problem with a single , bold stroke the return of some 47 billion in Federal programs to State and local government , together with the means to finance them and a transition period of nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption . I will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program . I want to emphasize , however , that its full details will have been worked out only after close consultation with congressional , State , and local officials . Starting in fiscal 1984 , the Federal Government will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing Medicaid program to go along with its existing responsibility for Medicare . As part of a financially equal swap , the States will simultaneously take full responsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps . This will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need , because it will be designed and administered closer to the grass roots and the people it serves . In 1984 the Federal Government will apply the full proceeds from certain excise taxes to a grass roots trust fund that will belong in fair shares to the 50 States . The total amount flowing into this fund will be 28 billion a year . Over the next 4 years the States can use this money in either of two ways . If they want to continue receiving Federal grants in such areas as transportation , education , and social services , they can use their trust fund money to pay for the grants . Or to the extent they choose to forgo the Federal grant programs , they can use their trust fund money on their own for those or other purposes . There will be a mandatory pass through of part of these funds to local governments . By 1988 the States will be in complete control of over 40 Federal grant programs . The trust fund will start to phase out , eventually to disappear , and the excise taxes will be turned over to the States . They can then preserve , lower , or raise taxes on their own and fund and manage these programs as they see fit . In a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end cumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the Federal level while we ensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people they are meant to help and the people who pay for them . Hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of State and local governments , we are proposing legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the 1980 s and 90 s . This legislation will permit States and localities to apply to the Federal Government for designation as urban enterprise zones . A broad range of special economic incentives in the zones will help attract new business , new jobs , new opportunity to America s inner cities and rural towns . Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise . Well , I say we must free enterprise so that together we can save America . Some will also say our States and local communities are not up to the challenge of a new and creative partnership . Well , that might have been true 20 years ago before reforms like reapportionment and the Voting Rights Act , the 10 year extension of which I strongly support . It is no longer true today . This administration has faith in State and local governments and the constitutional balance envisioned by the Founding Fathers . We also believe in the integrity , decency , and sound , good sense of grass roots Americans . Our faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor . Our private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successful community models of school , church , business , union , foundation , and civic programs that help community needs . Such groups are almost invariably far more efficient than government in running social programs . We are not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government programs dollar for dollar , service for service . We just want to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their example . Three hundred and eighty five thousand corporations and private organizations are already working on social programs ranging from drug rehabilitation to job training , and thousands more Americans have written us asking how they can help . The volunteer spirit is still alive and well in America . Our nation s long journey towards civil rights for all our citizens once a source of discord , now a source of pride must continue with no backsliding or slowing down . We must and shall see that those basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and , when necessary , strengthened . Our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable . We launched a new Task Force on Legal Equity for Women and a Fifty States Project that will examine State laws for discriminatory language . And for the first time in our history , a woman sits on the highest court in the land . So , too , the problem of crime one as real and deadly serious as any in America today . It demands that we seek transformation of our legal system , which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society and the innocent victims of crime without justice . We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air . We are encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further progress as the Senate continues its deliberations . So far , I have concentrated largely , now , on domestic matters . To view the state of the Union in perspective , we must not ignore the rest of the world . There is not time tonight for a lengthy treatment of social or foreign policy , I should say , a subject I intend to address in detail in the near future . A few words , however , are in order on the progress we have made over the past year , reestablishing respect for our nation around the globe and some of the challenges and goals that we will approach in the year ahead . At Ottawa and Cancun , I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and developing nations . Now , some of those I met with were a little surprised that I did not apologize for America s wealth . Instead , I spoke of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help them realize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom . I believe lasting friendships were made , and the foundation was laid for future cooperation . In the vital region of the Caribbean Basin , we are developing a program of aid , trade , and investment incentives to promote self sustaining growth and a better , more secure life for our neighbors to the south . Toward those who would export terrorism and subversion in the Caribbean and elsewhere , especially Cuba and Libya , we will act with firmness . Our foreign policy is a policy of strength , fairness , and balance . By restoring America s military credibility , by pursuing peace at the negotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good faith , and by regaining the respect of America s allies and adversaries alike , we have strengthened our country s position as a force for peace and progress in the world . When action is called for , we are taking it . Our sanctions against the military dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in Poland and against the Soviet regime behind that military dictatorship clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not conduct business as usual with the forces of oppression . If the events in Poland continue to deteriorate , further measures will follow . Now , let me also note that private American groups have taken the lead in making January 30th a day of solidarity with the people of Poland . So , too , the European Parliament has called for March 21st to be an international day of support for Afghanistan . Well , I urge all peace loving peoples to join together on those days , to raise their voices , to speak and pray for freedom . Meanwhile , we are working for reduction of arms and military activities , as I announced in my address to the Nation last November 18th . We have proposed to the Soviet Union a far reaching agenda for mutual reduction of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva on intermediate range nuclear forces . In those talks it is essential that we negotiate from a position of strength . There must be a real incentive for the Soviets to take these talks seriously . This requires that we rebuild our defenses . In the last decade , while we sought the moderation of Soviet power through a process of restraint and accommodation , the Soviets engaged in an unrelenting buildup of their military forces . The protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces . We have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in Europe and Asia , or to develop key relationships with our partners in the Middle East and other countries . Building a more peaceful world requires a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up . When radical forces threaten our friends , when economic misfortune creates conditions of instability , when strategically vital parts of the world fall under the shadow of Soviet power , our response can make the difference between peaceful change or disorder and violence . That is why we have laid such stress not only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program . Your recent passage of the Foreign Assistance Act sent a signal to the world that America will not shrink from making the investments necessary for both peace and security . Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism , not naivete or self delusion . A recognition of what the Soviet empire is about is the starting point . Winston Churchill , in negotiating with the Soviets , observed that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations . That is why we have moved to reconstruct our national defenses . We intend to keep the peace . We will also keep our freedom . We have made pledges of a new frankness in our public statements and worldwide broadcasts . In the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation , we have promised the world a season of truth the truth of our great civilized ideas individual liberty , representative government , the rule of law under God . We have never needed walls or minefields or barbed wire to keep our people in . Nor do we declare martial law to keep our people from voting for the kind of government they want . Yes , we have our problems yes , we are in a time of recession . And it is true , there is no quick fix , as I said , to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment . But we will end it . The process has already begun , and we will see its effect as the year goes on . We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago . But our glory did not end with them . Americans ever since have emulated their deeds . We do not have to turn to our history books for heroes . They are all around us . One who sits among you here tonight epitomized that heroism at the end of the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our Armed Forces . Who will ever forget that night when we waited for television to bring us the scene of that first plane landing at Clark Field in the Philippines , bringing our POW s home The plane door opened and Jeremiah Denton came slowly down the ramp . He caught sight of our flag , saluted it , said , God bless America , and then thanked us for bringing him home . Just 2 weeks ago , in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac , we saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest the heroism of dedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters . And we saw the heroism of one of our young government employees , Lenny Skutnik , who , when he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line , dived into the water and dragged her to safety . And then there are countless , quiet , everyday heroes of American who sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than they have known church and civic volunteers who help to feed , clothe , nurse , and teach the needy millions who have made our nation and our nation s destiny so very special unsung heroes who may not have realized their own dreams themselves but then who reinvest those dreams in their children . Do not let anyone tell you that America s best days are behind her , that the American spirit has been vanquished . We have seen it triumph too often in our lives to stop believing in it now . A hundred and twenty years ago , the greatest of all our Presidents delivered his second State of the Union message in this Chamber . We cannot escape history , Abraham Lincoln warned . We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves . The trial through which we pass will light us down , in honor or dishonor , to the latest generation . Well , that President and that Congress did not fail the American people . Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union . Let it be said of us that we , too , did not fail that we , too , worked together to bring America through difficult times . Let us so conduct ourselves that two centuries from now , another Congress and another President , meeting in this Chamber as we are meeting , will speak of us with pride , saying that we met the test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame of liberty this last , best hope of man on Earth . God bless you , and thank you .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans , Memorial Day is a day of ceremonies and speeches . Throughout America today , we honor the dead of our wars . We recall their valor and their sacrifices . We remember they gave their lives so that others might live . We are also gathered here for a special event the national funeral for an unknown soldier who will today join the heroes of three other wars . When he spoke at a ceremony at Gettysburg in 1863 , President Lincoln reminded us that through their deeds , the dead had spoken more eloquently for themselves than any of the living ever could , and that we living could only honor them by rededicating ourselves to the cause for which they so willingly gave a last full measure of devotion . Well , this is especially so today , for in our minds and hearts is the memory of Vietnam and all that that conflict meant for those who sacrificed on the field of battle and for their loved ones who suffered here at home . Not long ago , when a memorial was dedicated here in Washington to our Vietnam veterans , the events surrounding that dedication were a stirring reminder of America s resilience , of how our nation could learn and grow and transcend the tragedies of the past . During the dedication ceremonies , the rolls of those who died and are still missing were read for 3 days in a candlelight ceremony at the National Cathedral . And the veterans of Vietnam who were never welcomed home with speeches and bands , but who were never defeated in battle and were heroes as surely as any who have ever fought in a noble cause , staged their own parade on Constitution Avenue . As America watched them some in wheelchairs , all of them proud there was a feeling that this nation that as a nation we were coming together again and that we had , at long last , welcomed the boys home . A lot of healing went on , said one combat veteran who helped organize support for the memorial . And then there was this newspaper account that appeared after the ceremonies . I had like to read it to you . Yesterday , crowds returned to the Memorial . Among them was Herbie Petit , a machinist and former marine from New Orleans . Last night , he said , standing near the wall , I went out to dinner with some other ex marines . There was also a group of college students in the restaurant . We started talking to each other . And before we left , they stood up and cheered us . The whole week , Petit said , his eyes red , it was worth it just for that . It has been worth it . We Americans have learned to listen to each other and to trust each other again . We have learned that government owes the people an explanation and needs their support for its actions at home and abroad . And we have learned , and I pray this time for good , the most valuable lesson of all the preciousness of human freedom . It has been a lesson relearned not just by Americans but by all the people of the world . Yet , while the experience of Vietnam has given us a stark lesson that ultimately must move the conscience of the world , we must remember that we cannot today , as much as some might want to , close this chapter in our history , for the war in Southeast Asia still haunts a small but brave group of Americans the families of those still missing in the Vietnam conflict . They live day and night with uncertainty , with an emptiness , with a void that we cannot fathom . Today some sit among you . Their feelings are a mixture of pride and fear . They are proud of their sons or husbands , fathers or brothers who bravely and nobly answered the call of their country . But some of them fear that this ceremony writes a final chapter , leaving those they love forgotten . Well , today then , one way to honor those who served or may still be serving in Vietnam is to gather here and rededicate ourselves to securing the answers for the families of those missing in action . I ask the Members of Congress , the leaders of veterans groups , and the citizens of an entire nation present or listening , to give these families your help and your support , for they still sacrifice and suffer . Vietnam is not over for them . They cannot rest until they know the fate of those they loved and watched march off to serve their country . Our dedication to their cause must be strengthened with these events today . We write no last chapters . We close no books . We put away no final memories . An end to America s involvement in Vietnam cannot come before we have achieved the fullest possible accounting of those missing in action . This can only happen when their families know with certainty that this nation discharged her duty to those who served nobly and well . Today a united people call upon Hanoi with one voice Heal the sorest wound of this conflict . Return our sons to America . End the grief of those who are innocent and undeserving of any retribution . The Unknown Soldier who is returned to us today and whom we lay to rest is symbolic of all our missing sons , and we will present him with the Congressional Medal of Honor , the highest military decoration that we can bestow . About him we may well wonder , as others have As a child , did he play on some street in a great American city Or did he work beside his father on a farm out in America s heartland Did he marry Did he have children Did he look expectantly to return to a bride We will never know the answers to these questions about his life . We do know , though , why he died . He saw the horrors of war but bravely faced them , certain his own cause and his country s cause was a noble one that he was fighting for human dignity , for free men everywhere . Today we pause to embrace him and all who served us so well in a war whose end offered no parades , no flags , and so little thanks . We can be worthy of the values and ideals for which our sons sacrificed worthy of their courage in the face of a fear that few of us will ever experience by honoring their commitment and devotion to duty and country . Many veterans of Vietnam still serve in the Armed Forces , work in our offices , on our farms , and in our factories . Most have kept their experiences private , but most have been strengthened by their call to duty . A grateful nation opens her heart today in gratitude for their sacrifice , for their courage , and for their noble service . Let us , if we must , debate the lessons learned at some other time . Today , we simply say with pride , Thank you , dear son . May God cradle you in His loving arms . We present to you our nation s highest award , the Congressional Medal of Honor , for service above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy during the Vietnam era . Thank you .

Thank you .<speech_sep>Secretary General , President , distinguished delegates , ladies and gentlemen I speak today as both a citizen of the United States and of the world . I come with the heartfelt wishes of my people for peace , bearing honest proposals and looking for genuine progress . Dag Hammarskjold said 24 years ago this month , We meet in a time of peace , which is no peace . His words are as true today as they were then . More than a hundred disputes have disturbed the peace among nations since World War Iand today the threat of nuclear disaster hangs over the lives of all our people . The Bible tells us there will be a time for peace , but so far this century mankind has failed to find it . The United Nations is dedicated to world peace , and its charter clearly prohibits the international use of force . Yet the tide of belligerence continues to rise . The charter s influence has weakened even in the 4 years since the first special session on disarmament . We must not only condemn aggression we must enforce the dictates of our charter and resume the struggle for peace . The record of history is clear Citizens of the United States resort to force reluctantly and only when they must . Our foreign policy , as President Eisenhower once said , is not difficult to state . We are for peace first , last , and always for very simple reasons . We know that only in a peaceful atmosphere , a peace with justice , one in which we can be confident , can America prosper as we have known prosperity in the past , he said . He said to those who challenge the truth of those words , let me point out , at the end of World War Iwe were the only undamaged industrial power in the world . Our military supremacy was unquestioned . We had harnessed the atom and had the ability to unleash its destructive force anywhere in the world . In short , we could have achieved world domination , but that was contrary to the character of our people . Instead , we wrote a new chapter in the history of mankind . We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravaged economies of the world , both East and West , including those nations who had been our enemies . We took the initiative in creating such international institutions as this United Nations , where leaders of good will could come together to build bridges for peace and prosperity . America has no territorial ambitions . We occupy no countries , and we have built no walls to lock our people in . Our commitment to self determination , freedom , and peace is the very soul of America . That commitment is as strong today as it ever was . The United States has fought four wars in my lifetime . In each , we struggled to defend freedom and democracy . We were never the aggressors . America s strength and , yes , her military power have been a force for peace , not conquest for democracy , not despotism for freedom , not tyranny . Watching , as I have , succeeding generations of American youth bleed their lives onto far flung battlefields to protect our ideals and secure the rule of law , I have known how important it is to deter conflict . But since coming to the Presidency , the enormity of the responsibility of this office has made my commitment even deeper . I believe that responsibility is shared by all of us here today . On our recent trip to Europe , my wife , Nancy , told me of a bronze statue , 22 feet high , that she saw on a cliff on the coast of France . The beach at the base of the cliff is called Saint Laurent , but countless American family Bibles have written it in on the flyleaf and know it as Omaha Beach . The pastoral quiet of that French countryside is in marked contrast to the bloody violence that took place there on a June day 38 years ago when the Allies stormed the Continent . At the end of just one day of battle , 10 , 500 Americans were wounded , missing , or killed in what became known as the Normandy landing . The statue atop that cliff is called The Spirit of American Youth Rising From the Waves . Its image of sacrifice is almost too powerful to describe . The pain of war is still vivid in our national memory . It sends me to this special session of the United Nations eager to comply with the plea of Pope Paul VI when he spoke in this chamber nearly 17 years ago . If you want to be brothers , His Holiness said , let the arms fall from your hands . Well , we Americans yearn to let them go . But we need more than mere words , more than empty promises before we can proceed . We look around the world and see rampant conflict and aggression . There are many sources of this conflict expansionist ambitions , local rivalries , the striving to obtain justice and security . We must all work to resolve such discords by peaceful means and to prevent them from escalation . In the nuclear era , the major powers bear a special responsibility to ease these sources of conflict and to refrain from aggression . And that is why we are so deeply concerned by Soviet conduct . Since World War Ithe record of tyranny has included Soviet violation of the Yalta agreements leading to domination of Eastern Europe , symbolized by the Berlin Wall a grim , gray monument to repression that I visited just a week ago . It includes the takeovers of Czechoslovakia , Hungary , and Afghanistan and the ruthless repression of the proud people of Poland . Soviet sponsored guerrillas and terrorists are at work in Central and South America , in Africa , the Middle East , in the Caribbean , and in Europe , violating human rights and unnerving the world with violence . Communist atrocities in Southeast Asia , Afghanistan , and elsewhere continue to shock the free world as refugees escape to tell of their horror . The decade of so called detente witnessed the most massive Soviet buildup of military power in history . They increased their defense spending by 40 percent while American defense actually declined in the same real terms . Soviet aggression and support for violence around the world have eroded the confidence needed for arms negotiations . While we exercised unilateral restraint , they forged ahead and today possess nuclear and conventional forces far in excess of an adequate deterrent capability . Soviet oppression is not limited to the countries they invade . At the very time the Soviet Union is trying to manipulate the peace movement in the West , it is stifling a budding peace movement at home . In Moscow , banners are scuttled , buttons are snatched , and demonstrators are arrested when even a few people dare to speak about their fears . Eleanor Roosevelt , one of our first ambassadors to this body , reminded us that the high sounding words of tyrants stand in bleak contradiction to their deeds . Their promises , she said , are in deep contrast to their performances . My country learned a bitter lesson in this century The scourge of tyranny cannot be stopped with words alone . So , we have embarked on an effort to renew our strength that had fallen dangerously low . We refuse to become weaker while potential adversaries remain committed to their imperialist adventures . My people have sent me here today to speak for them as citizens of the world , which they truly are , for we Americans are drawn from every nationality represented in this chamber today . We understand that men and women of every race and creed can and must work together for peace . We stand ready to take the next steps down the road of cooperation through verifiable arms reduction . Agreements on arms control and disarmament can be useful in reinforcing peace but they are not magic . We should not confuse the signing of agreements with the solving of problems . Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace . Agreements genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept . Otherwise we are building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of war . Let me repeat , we need deeds , not words , to convince us of Soviet sincerity , should they choose to join us on this path . Since the end of World War Ithe United States has been the leader in serious disarmament and arms control proposals . In 1946 , in what became known as the Baruch plan , the United States submitted a proposal for control of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy by an international authority . The Soviets rejected this plan . In 1955 President Eisenhower made his Open Skies proposal , under which the United States and the Soviet Union would have exchanged blueprints of military establishments and provided for aerial reconnaissance . The Soviets rejected this plan . In 1963 the Limited Test Ban Treaty came into force . This treaty ended nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere , outer space , or under water by participating nations . In 1970 the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons took effect . The United States played a major role in this key effort to prevent the spread of nuclear explosives and to provide for international safeguards on civil nuclear activities . My country remains deeply committed to those objectives today , and to strengthening the nonproliferation framework . This is essential to international security . In the early 1970 s , again at United States urging , agreements were reached between the United States and the S . providing for ceilings on some categories of weapons . They could have been more meaningful if Soviet actions had shown restraint and commitment to stability at lower levels of force . The United Nations designated the 1970 s as the First Disarmament Decade . But good intentions were not enough . In reality that 10 year period included an unprecedented buildup in military weapons and the flaring of aggression and use of force in almost every region of the world . We are now in the Second Disarmament Decade . The task at hand is to assure civilized behavior among nations , to unite behind an agenda of peace . Over the past 7 months , the United States has put forward a broad based , comprehensive series of proposals to reduce the risk of war . We have proposed four major points as an agenda for peace elimination of landbased , intermediate range missiles a onethird reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads a substantial reduction in NATO and Warsaw Pact ground and air forces and new safeguards to reduce the risk of accidental war . We urge the Soviet Union today to join with us in this quest . We must act not for ourselves alone , but for all mankind . On November 18th of last year , I announced United States objectives in arms control agreements . They must be equitable and militarily significant . They must stabilize forces at lower levels , and they must be verifiable . The United States and its allies have made specific , reasonable , and equitable proposals . In February , our negotiating team in Geneva offered the Soviet Union a draft treaty on intermediate range nuclear forces . We offered to cancel deployment of our Pershing II ballistic missiles and ground launched cruise missiles in exchange for Soviet elimination of the SS 20 , SS 4 , and SS 5 missiles . This proposal would eliminate with one stroke those systems about which both sides have expressed the greatest concern . The United States is also looking forward to beginning negotiations on strategic arms reductions with the Soviet Union in less than 2 weeks . We will work hard to make these talks an opportunity for real progress in our quest for peace . On May 9th I announced a phased approach to the reduction of strategic arms . In a first phase , the number of ballistic missile warheads on each side would be reduced to about 5 , 000 . No more than half the remaining warheads would be on landbased missiles . All ballistic missiles would be reduced to an equal level , at about one half the current United States number . In the second phase , we would reduce each side s overall destructive power to equal levels , including a mutual ceiling on ballistic missile throw weight below the current level . We are also prepared to discuss other elements of the strategic balance . Before I returned from Europe last week , I met in Bonn with the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . We agreed to introduce a major new Western initiative for the Vienna negotiations on Mutual Balanced Force Reductions . Our approach calls for common , collective ceilings for both NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization . After 7 years , there would be a total of 700 , 000 ground forces and 900 , 000 ground and air force personnel combined . It also includes a package of associated measures to encourage cooperation and verify compliance . We urge the Soviet Union and members of the Warsaw Pact to view our Western proposal as a means to reach agreement in Vienna after 9 long years of inconclusive talks . We also urge them to implement the 1975 Helsinki agreement on security and cooperation in Europe . Let me stress that for agreements to work , both sides must be able to verify compliance . The building of mutual confidence in compliance can only be achieved through greater openness . I encourage the special session on disarmament to endorse the importance of these principles in arms control agreements . I have instructed our representatives at the 40 nation Committee on Disarmament to renew emphasis on verification and compliance . Based on a proposal , a committee has been formed to examine these issues as they relate to restrictions on nuclear testing . We are also pressing the need for effective verification provisions in agreements banning chemical weapons . The use of chemical and biological weapons has long been viewed with revulsion by civilized nations . No peacemaking institution can ignore the use of those dread weapons and still live up to its mission . The need for a truly effective and verifiable chemical weapons agreement has been highlighted by recent events . The Soviet Union and their allies are violating the Geneva Protocol of 1925 , related rules of international law , and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention . There is conclusive evidence that the Soviet Government has provided toxins for use in Laos and Kampuchea , and are themselves using chemical weapons against freedom fighters in Afghanistan . We have repeatedly protested to the Soviet Government , as well as to the Governments of Laos and Vietnam , their use of chemical and toxin weapons . We call upon them now to grant full and free access to their countries or to territories they control so that United Nations experts can conduct an effective , independent investigation to verify cessation of these horrors . Evidence of noncompliance with existing arms control agreements underscores the need to approach negotiation of any new agreements with care . The democracies of the West are open societies . Information on our defenses is available to our citizens , our elected officials , and the world . We do not hesitate to inform potential adversaries of our military forces and ask in return for the same information concerning theirs . The amount and type of military spending by a country is important for the world to know , as a measure of its intentions and the threat that country may pose to its neighbors . The Soviet Union and other closed societies go to extraordinary lengths to hide their true military spending , not only from other nations but from their own people . This practice contributes to distrust and fear about their intentions . Today , the United States proposes an international conference on military expenditures to build on the work of this body in developing a common system for accounting and reporting . We urge the Soviet Union , in particular , to join this effort in good faith , to revise the universally discredited official figures it publishes , and to join with us in giving the world a true account of the resources we allocate to our armed forces . Last Friday in Berlin , I said that I would leave no stone unturned in the effort to reinforce peace and lessen the risk of war . It is been clear to me steps should be taken to improve mutual communication , confidence , and lessen the likelihood of misinterpretation . I have , therefore , directed the exploration of ways to increase understanding and communication between the United States and the Soviet Union in times of peace and of crisis . We will approach the Soviet Union with proposals for reciprocal exchanges in such areas as advance notification of major strategic exercises that otherwise might be misinterpreted advance notification of ICBM launches within , as well as beyond , national boundaries and an expanded exchange of strategic forces data . While substantial information on activities and forces in these areas already is provided , I believe that jointly and regularly sharing information would represent a qualitative improvement in the strategic nuclear environment and would help reduce the chance of misunderstandings . I call upon the Soviet Union to join the United States in exploring these possibilities to build confidence , and I ask for your support of our efforts . One of the major items before this conference is the development of a comprehensive program of disarmament . We support the effort to chart a course of realistic and effective measures in the quest for peace . I have come to this hall to call for international recommitment to the basic tenet of the United Nations Charter that all members practice tolerance and live together in peace as good neighbors under the rule of law , forsaking armed force as a means of settling disputes between nations . America urges you to support the agenda for peace that I have outlined today . We ask you to reinforce the bilateral and multilateral arms control negotiations between members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact and to rededicate yourselves to maintaining international peace and security , and removing threats to peace . We , who have signed the Charter , have pledged to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territory or independence of any state . In these times when more and more lawless acts are going unpunished as some members of this very body show a growing disregard for the Charter the peace loving nations of the world must condemn aggression and pledge again to act in a way that is worthy of the ideals that we have endorsed . Let us finally make the charter live . In late spring , 37 years ago , representatives of 50 nations gathered on the other side of this continent , in the San Francisco Opera House . The League of Nations had crumbled , and World War II still raged . But those men and nations were determined to find peace . The result was this charter for peace that is the framework of the United Nations . President Harry Truman spoke of the revival of an old faith . He said the everlasting moral force of justice prompting that United Nations Conference such a force remains strong in America and in other countries where speech is free and citizens have the right to gather and make their opinions known . And President Truman said , If we should pay merely lip service to inspiring ideals , and later do violence to simple justice , we would draw down upon us the bitter wrath of generations yet unborn . Those words of Harry Truman have special meaning for us today as we live with the potential to destroy civilization . We must learn to live together in peace , he said . We must build a new world a far better world . What a better world it would be if the guns were silent , if neighbor no longer encroached on neighbor , and all peoples were free to reap the rewards of their toil and determine their own destiny and system of government , whatever their choice . During my recent audience with His Holiness Pope John Paul II gave him the pledge of the American people to do everything possible for peace and arms reduction . The American people believe forging real and lasting peace to be their sacred trust . Let us never forget that such a peace would be a terrible hoax if the world were no longer blessed with freedom and respect for human rights . The United Nations , Hammarskjold said , was born out of the cataclysms of war . It should justify the sacrifices of all those who have died for freedom and justice . It is our duty to the past . Hammarskjold said , And it is our duty to the future so to serve both our nations and the world . As both patriots of our nations and the hope of all the world , let those of us assembled here in the name of peace deepen our understandings , renew our commitment to the rule of law , and take new and bolder steps to calm an uneasy world . Can any delegate here deny that in so doing he would be doing what the people , the rank and file of his own country or her own country want him or her to do Is not it time for us to really represent the deepest most heartfelt yearnings of all of our people Let no nation abuse this common longing to be free of fear . We must not manipulate our people by playing upon their nightmares . We must serve mankind through genuine disarmament . With God s help we can secure life and freedom for generations to come . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Reverend clergy all , Senator Hawkins , distinguished members of the Florida congressional delegation , and all of you I cannot tell you how you have warmed my heart with your welcome . I am delighted to be here today . Those of you in the National Association of Evangelicals are known for your spiritual and humanitarian work . And I would be especially remiss if I did not discharge right now one personal debt of gratitude . Thank you for your prayers . Nancy and I have felt their presence many times in many ways . And believe me , for us they have made all the difference . The other day in the East Room of the White House at a meeting there , someone asked me whether I was aware of all the people out there who were praying for the President . And I had to say , Yes , I am . I have felt it . I believe in intercessionary prayer . But I could not help but say to that questioner after he had asked the question that or at least say to them that if sometime when he was praying he got a busy signal , it was just me in there ahead of him . I think I understand how Abraham Lincoln felt when he said , I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go . From the joy and the good feeling of this conference , I go to a political reception . Now , I do not know why , but that bit of scheduling reminds me of a story which I will share with you . An evangelical minister and a politician arrived at Heaven s gate one day together . And Peter , after doing all the necessary formalities , took them in hand to show them where their quarters would be . And he took them to a small , single room with a bed , a chair , and a table and said this was for the clergyman . And the politician was a little worried about what might be in store for him . And he could not believe it then when Peter stopped in front of a beautiful mansion with lovely grounds , many servants , and told him that these would be his quarters . And he could not help but ask , he said , But wait , how there is something wrong how do I get this mansion while that good and holy man only gets a single room And Peter said , You have to understand how things are up here . We have got thousands and thousands of clergy . You are the first politician who ever made it . But I do not want to contribute to a stereotype . So , I tell you there are a great many God fearing , dedicated , noble men and women in public life , present company included . And , yes , we need your help to keep us ever mindful of the ideas and the principles that brought us into the public arena in the first place . The basis of those ideals and principles is a commitment to freedom and personal liberty that , itself , is grounded in the much deeper realization that freedom prospers only where the blessings of God are avidly sought and humbly accepted . The American experiment in democracy rests on this insight . Its discovery was the great triumph of our Founding Fathers , voiced by William Penn when he said If we will not be governed by God , we must be governed by tyrants . Explaining the inalienable rights of men , Jefferson said , The God who gave us life , gave us liberty at the same time . And it was George Washington who said that of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity , religion and morality are indispensable supports . And finally , that shrewdest of all observers of American democracy , Alexis de Tocqueville , put it eloquently after he had gone on a search for the secret of America s greatness and genius and he said Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the greatness and the genius of America . . . . America is good . And if America ever ceases to be good , America will cease to be great . Well , I am pleased to be here today with you who are keeping America great by keeping her good . Only through your work and prayers and those of millions of others can we hope to survive this perilous century and keep alive this experiment in liberty , this last , best hope of man . I want you to know that this administration is motivated by a political philosophy that sees the greatness of America in you , her people , and in your families , churches , neighborhoods , communities the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and respect for the rule of law under God . Now , I do not have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to , or at least out of step with , a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern day secularism , discarding the tried and time tested values upon which our very civilization is based . No matter how well intentioned , their value system is radically different from that of most Americans . And while they proclaim that they are freeing us from superstitions of the past , they have taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation . Sometimes their voices are louder than ours , but they are not yet a majority . An example of that vocal superiority is evident in a controversy now going on in Washington . And since I am involved , I have been waiting to hear from the parents of young America . How far are they willing to go in giving to government their prerogatives as parents Let me state the case as briefly and simply as I can . An organization of citizens , sincerely motivated and deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving girls well below the age of consent , sometime ago established a nationwide network of clinics to offer help to these girls and , hopefully , alleviate this situation . Now , again , let me say , I do not fault their intent . However , in their well intentioned effort , these clinics have decided to provide advice and birth control drugs and devices to underage girls without the knowledge of their parents . For some years now , the federal government has helped with funds to subsidize these clinics . In providing for this , the Congress decreed that every effort would be made to maximize parental participation . Nevertheless , the drugs and devices are prescribed without getting parental consent or giving notification after they have done so . Girls termed sexually active and that has replaced the word promiscuous are given this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion . Well , we have ordered clinics receiving federal funds to notify the parents such help has been given . One of the nation s leading newspapers has created the term squeal rule in editorializing against us for doing this , and we are being criticized for violating the privacy of young people . A judge has recently granted an injunction against an enforcement of our rule . I have watched TV panel shows discuss this issue , seen columnists pontificating on our error , but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex . Is all of Judeo Christian tradition wrong Are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm And is not it the parents right to give counsel and advice to keep their children from making mistakes that may affect their entire lives Many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their family by government . We are going to fight in the courts . The right of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washington based bureaucrats and social engineers . But the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy . Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God is acknowledged . When our Founding Fathers passed the first amendment , they sought to protect churches from government interference . They never intended to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself . The evidence of this permeates our history and our government . The Declaration of Independence mentions the Supreme Being no less than four times . In God We Trust is engraved on our coinage . The Supreme Court opens its proceedings with a religious invocation . And the members of Congress open their sessions with a prayer . I just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same privileges as Supreme Court Justices and Congressmen . Last year , I sent the Congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools . Already this session , there is growing bipartisan support for the amendment , and I am calling on the Congress to act speedily to pass it and to let our children pray . Perhaps some of you read recently about the Lubbock school case , where a judge actually ruled that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student groups , even when the group meetings were being held during the students own time . The first amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech . Senators Denton and Hatfield have proposed legislation in the Congress on the whole question of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech . Such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students . And I hope the Congress considers these bills quickly . And with your help , I think it is possible we could also get the constitutional amendment through the Congress this year . More than a decade ago , a Supreme Court decision literally wiped off the books of 50 states statutes protecting the rights of unborn children . Abortion on demand now takes the lives of up to one and a half million unborn children a year . Human life legislation ending this tragedy will some day pass the Congress , and you and I must never rest until it does . Unless and until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity , then its right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness must be protected . You may remember that when abortion on demand began , many , and , indeed , I am sure many of you , warned that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life , that the philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify other attacks on the sacredness of human life infanticide or mercy killing . Tragically enough , those warnings proved all too true . Only last year a court permitted the death by starvation of a handicapped infant . I have directed the Health and Human Services Department to make clear to every health care facility in the United States that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects all handicapped persons against discrimination based on handicaps , including infants . And we have taken the further step of requiring that each and every recipient of federal funds who provides health care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by federal law . It also lists a 24 hour , toll free number so that nurses and others may report violations in time to save the infant s life . In addition , recent legislation introduced in the Congress by Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions , it also addresses this whole problem of infanticide . I urge the Congress to begin hearings and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all children , including the disabled or handicapped . Now , I am sure that you must get discouraged at times , but you have done better than you know , perhaps . There is a great spiritual awakening in America , a renewal of the traditional values that have been the bedrock of America s goodness and greatness . One recent survey by a Washington based research council concluded that Americans were far more religious than the people of other nations 95 percent of those surveyed expressed a belief in God and a huge majority believed the Ten Commandments had real meaning in their lives . And another study has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans disapprove of adultery , teenage sex , pornography , abortion , and hard drugs . And this same study showed a deep reverence for the importance of family ties and religious belief . I think the items that we have discussed here today must be a key part of the nation s political agenda . For the first time the Congress is openly and seriously debating and dealing with the prayer and abortion issues and that is enormous progress right there . I repeat America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal . And with your biblical keynote , I say today , Yes , let justice roll on like a river , righteousness like a never failing stream . Now , obviously , much of this new political and social consensus I have talked about is based on a positive view of American history , one that takes pride in our country s accomplishments and record . But we must never forget that no government schemes are going to perfect man . We know that living in this world means dealing with what philosophers would call the phenomenology of evil or , as theologians would put it , the doctrine of sin . There is sin and evil in the world , and we are enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might . Our nation , too , has a legacy of evil with which it must deal . The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past . For example , the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights , once a source of disunity and civil war , is now a point of pride for all Americans . We must never go back . There is no room for racism , anti Semitism , or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country . I know that you have been horrified , as have by the resurgence of some hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice . Use the mighty voice of your pulpits and the powerful standing of your churches to denounce and isolate these hate groups in our midst . The commandment given us is clear and simple Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . But whatever sad episodes exist in our past , any objective observer must hold a positive view of American history , a history that has been the story of hopes fulfilled and dreams made into reality . Especially in this century , America has kept alight the torch of freedom , but not just for ourselves but for millions of others around the world . And this brings me to my final point today . During my first press conference as President , in answer to a direct question , I pointed out that , as good Marxist Leninists , the Soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause , which is world revolution . I think I should point out I was only quoting Lenin , their guiding spirit , who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas that is their name for religion or ideas that are outside class conceptions . Morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war . And everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old , exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat . Well , I think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of Soviet doctrine illustrates an historical reluctance to see totalitarian powers for what they are . We saw this phenomenon in the 1930s . We see it too often today . This does not mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with them . I intend to do everything I can to persuade them of our peaceful intent , to remind them that it was the West that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the forties and fifties for territorial gain and which now proposes 50 percent cut in strategic ballistic missiles and the elimination of an entire class of land based , intermediate range nuclear missiles . At the same time , however , they must be made to understand we will never compromise our principles and standards . We will never give away our freedom . We will never abandon our belief in God . And we will never stop searching for a genuine peace . But we can assure none of these things America stands for through the so called nuclear freeze solutions proposed by some . The truth is that a freeze now would be a very dangerous fraud , for that is merely the illusion of peace . The reality is that we must find peace through strength . I would agree to a freeze if only we could freeze the Soviets global desires . A freeze at current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the Soviets to negotiate seriously in Geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have proposed . Instead , they would achieve their objectives through the freeze . A freeze would reward the Soviet Union for its enormous and unparalleled military buildup . It would prevent the essential and long overdue modernization of United States and allied defenses and would leave our aging forces increasingly vulnerable . And an honest freeze would require extensive prior negotiations on the systems and numbers to be limited and on the measures to ensure effective verification and compliance . And the kind of a freeze that has been suggested would be virtually impossible to verify . Such a major effort would divert us completely from our current negotiations on achieving substantial reductions . A number of years ago , I heard a young father , a very prominent young man in the entertainment world , addressing a tremendous gathering in California . It was during the time of the cold war , and communism and our own way of life were very much on people s minds . And he was speaking to that subject . And suddenly , though , I heard him saying , I love my little girls more than anything And I said to myself , Oh , no , do not . You cannot do not say that . But I had underestimated him . He went on I would rather see my little girls die now , still believing in God , than have them grow up under communism and one day die no longer believing in God . There were thousands of young people in that audience . They came to their feet with shouts of joy . They had instantly recognized the profound truth in what he had said , with regard to the physical and the soul and what was truly important . Yes , let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness pray they will discover the joy of knowing God . But until they do , let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state , declare its omnipotence over individual man , and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the Earth , they are the focus of evil in the modern world . It was Lewis who , in his unforgettable Screwtape Letters , wrote The greatest evil is not done now in those sordid dens of crime that Dickens loved to paint . It is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps . In those we see its final result . But it is conceived and ordered in clear , carpeted , warmed , and well lighted offices , by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice . Well , because these quiet men do not raise their voices , because they sometimes speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace , because , like other dictators before them , they are always making their final territorial demand , some would have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses . But if history teaches anything , it teaches that simple minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly . It means the betrayal of our past , the squandering of our freedom . So , I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority . You know , I have always believed that old Screwtape reserved his best efforts for those of you in the church . So , in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals , I urge you to beware the temptation of pride the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault , to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire , to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil . I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for our efforts , this administration s efforts , to keep America strong and free , while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the world s nuclear arsenals and one day , with God s help , their total elimination . While America s military strength is important , let me add here that I have always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets , by armies or military might . The real crisis we face today is a spiritual one at root , it is a test of moral will and faith . Whittaker Chambers , the man whose own religious conversion made him a witness to one of the terrible traumas of our time , the Hiss Chambers case , wrote that the crisis of the Western World exists to the degree in which the West is indifferent to God , the degree to which it collaborates in communism s attempt to make man stand alone without God . And then he said , for Marxism Leninism is actually the second oldest faith , first proclaimed in the Garden of Eden with the words of temptation , Ye shall be as gods . The Western World can answer this challenge , he wrote , but only provided that its faith in God and the freedom He enjoins is as great as communism s faith in Man . I believe we shall rise to the challenge . I believe that communism is another sad , bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written . I believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material , but spiritual . And because it knows no limitation , it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man . For in the words of Isaiah He giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might He increased strength . . . . But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run , and not be weary . . . . Yes , change your world . One of our Founding Fathers , Thomas Paine , said , We have it within our power to begin the world over again . We can do it , doing together what no one church could do by itself . God bless you , and thank you very much .<speech_sep>The President . Good evening . Usually , I talk with you from my office in the West Wing of the White House . But tonight there is something special to talk about , and I have asked someone very special to join me . Nancy and I are here in the West Hall of the White House , and around us are the rooms in which we live . It is the home you have provided for us , of which we merely have temporary custody . Nancy s joining me because the message this evening is not my message but ours . And we speak to you not simply as fellow citizens but as fellow parents and grandparents and as concerned neighbors . It is back to school time for America s children . And while drug and alcohol abuse cuts across all generations , it is especially damaging to the young people on whom our future depends . So tonight , from our family to yours , from our home to yours , thank you for joining us . America has accomplished so much in these last few years , whether it is been rebuilding our economy or serving the cause of freedom in the world . What we have been able to achieve has been done with your help with us working together as a nation united . Now , we need your support again . Drugs are menacing our society . They are threatening our values and undercutting our institutions . They are killing our children . From the beginning of our administration , we have taken strong steps to do something about this horror . Tonight I can report to you that we have made much progress . Thirty seven federal agencies are working together in a vigorous national effort , and by next year our spending for drug law enforcement will have more than tripled from its 1981 levels . We have increased seizures of illegal drugs . Shortages of marijuana are now being reported . Last year alone over 10 , 000 drug criminals were convicted and nearly 250 million of their assets were seized by the DEthe Drug Enforcement Administration . And in the most important area , individual use , we see progress . In 4 years the number of high school seniors using marijuana on a daily basis has dropped from 1 in 14 to 1 in 20 . The military has cut the use of illegal drugs among its personnel by 67 percent since 1980 . These are a measure of our commitment and emerging signs that we can defeat this enemy . But we still have much to do . Despite our best efforts , illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels , and 4 to 5 million people regularly use it . Five hundred thousand Americans are hooked on heroin . One in twelve persons smokes marijuana regularly . Regular drug use is even higher among the age group 18 to 25 most likely just entering the workforce . Today there is a new epidemic smokable cocaine , otherwise known as crack . It is an explosively destructive and often lethal substance which is crushing its users . It is an uncontrolled fire . And drug abuse is not a so called victimless crime . Everyone s safety is at stake when drugs and excessive alcohol are used by people on the highways or by those transporting our citizens or operating industrial equipment . Drug abuse costs you and your fellow Americans at least 60 billion a year . From the early days of our administration , Nancy has been intensely involved in the effort to fight drug abuse . She has since traveled over 100 , 000 miles to 55 cities in 28 States and 6 foreign countries to fight school age drug and alcohol abuse . She is given dozens of speeches and scores of interviews and has participated in 24 special radio and TV tapings to create greater awareness of this crisis . Her personal observations and efforts have given her such dramatic insights that I wanted her to share them with you this evening . Nancy . Reagan . Thank you . As a mother , I have always thought of September as a special month , a time when we bundled our children off to school , to the warmth of an environment in which they could fulfill the promise and hope in those restless minds . But so much has happened over these last years , so much to shake the foundations of all that we know and all that we believe in . Today there is a drug and alcohol abuse epidemic in this country , and no one is safe from it not you , not me , and certainly not our children , because this epidemic has their names written on it . Many of you may be thinking Well , drugs do not concern me . But it does concern you . It concerns us all because of the way it tears at our lives and because it is aimed at destroying the brightness and life of the sons and daughters of the United States . For 5 years I have been traveling across the country learning and listening . And one of the most hopeful signs I have seen is the building of an essential , new awareness of how terrible and threatening drug abuse is to our society . This was one of the main purposes when I started , so of course it makes me happy that that is been accomplished . But each time I meet with someone new or receive another letter from a troubled person on drugs , I yearn to find a way to help share the message that cries out from them . As a parent , I am especially concerned about what drugs are doing to young mothers and their newborn children . Listen to this news account from a hospital in Florida of a child born to a mother with a cocaine habit Nearby , a baby named Paul lies motionless in an incubator , feeding tubes riddling his tiny body . He needs a respirator to breathe and a daily spinal tap to relieve fluid buildup on his brain . Only 1 month old , he is already suffered 2 strokes . Now you can see why drug abuse concerns every one of us all the American family . Drugs steal away so much . They take and take , until finally every time a drug goes into a child , something else is forced out like love and hope and trust and confidence . Drugs take away the dream from every child s heart and replace it with a nightmare , and it is time we in America stand up and replace those dreams . Each of us has to put our principles and consciences on the line , whether in social settings or in the workplace , to set forth solid standards and stick to them . There is no moral middle ground . Indifference is not an option . We want you to help us create an outspoken intolerance for drug use . For the sake of our children , I implore each of you to be unyielding and inflexible in your opposition to drugs . Our young people are helping us lead the way . Not long ago , in Oakland , California , I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs , and I answered , Just say no . Soon after that , those children in Oakland formed a Just Say No club , and now there are over 10 , 000 such clubs all over the country . Well , their participation and their courage in saying no needs our encouragement . We can help by using every opportunity to force the issue of not using drugs to the point of making others uncomfortable , even if it means making ourselves unpopular . Our job is never easy because drug criminals are ingenious . They work everyday to plot a new and better way to steal our children s lives , just as they have done by developing this new drug , crack . For every door that we close , they open a new door to death . They prosper on our unwillingness to act . So , we must be smarter and stronger and tougher than they are . It is up to us to change attitudes and just simply dry up their markets . And finally , to young people watching or listening , I have a very personal message for you There is a big , wonderful world out there for you . It belongs to you . It is exciting and stimulating and rewarding . Do not cheat yourselves out of this promise . Our country needs you , but it needs you to be clear eyed and clear minded . I recently read one teenager s story . She is now determined to stay clean but was once strung out on several drugs . What she remembered most clearly about her recovery was that during the time she was on drugs everything appeared to her in shades of black and gray and after her treatment she was able to see colors again . So , to my young friends out there Life can be great , but not when you cannot see it . So , open your eyes to life to see it in the vivid colors that God gave us as a precious gift to His children , to enjoy life to the fullest , and to make it count . Say yes to your life . And when it comes to drugs and alcohol just say no . The President . I think you can see why Nancy has been such a positive influence on all that we are trying to do . The job ahead of us is very clear . Nancy s personal crusade , like that of so many other wonderful individuals , should become our national crusade . It must include a combination of government and private efforts which complement one another . Last month I announced six initiatives which we believe will do just that . First , we seek a drug free workplace at all levels of government and in the private sector . Second , we will work toward drug free schools . Third , we want to ensure that the public is protected and that treatment is available to substance abusers and the chemically dependent . Our fourth goal is to expand international cooperation while treating drug trafficking as a threat to our national security . In October 1 will be meeting with key Ambassadors to discuss what can be done to support our friends abroad . Fifth , we must move to strengthen law enforcement activities such as those initiated by Vice President Bush and Attorney General Meese . And finally , we seek to expand public awareness and prevention . In order to further implement these six goals , I will announce tomorrow a series of new proposals for a drug free America . Taken as a whole , these proposals will toughen our laws against drug criminals , encourage more research and treatment , and ensure that illegal drugs will not be tolerated in our schools or in our workplaces . Together with our ongoing efforts , these proposals will bring the Federal commitment to fighting drugs to 3 billion . As much financing as we commit , however , we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that massive new amounts of money alone will provide the solution . Let us not forget that in America people solve problems and no national crusade has ever succeeded without human investment . Winning the crusade against drugs will not be achieved by just throwing money at the problem . Your government will continue to act aggressively , but nothing would be more effective than for Americans simply to quit using illegal drugs . We seek to create a massive change in national attitudes which ultimately will separate the drugs from the customer , to take the user away from the supply . I believe , quite simply , that we can help them quit , and that is where you come in . My generation will remember how America swung into action when we were attacked in World War IThe war was not just fought by the fellows flying the planes or driving the tanks . It was fought at home by a mobilized nation men and women alike building planes and ships , clothing sailors and soldiers , feeding marines and airmen and it was fought by children planting victory gardens and collecting cans . Well , now we are in another war for our freedom , and it is time for all of us to pull together again . So , for example , if your friend or neighbor or a family member has a drug or alcohol problem , do not turn the other way . Go to his help or to hers . Get others involved with you clubs , service groups , and community organizations and provide support and strength . And , of course , many of you have been cured through treatment and self help . Well , you are the combat veterans , and you have a critical role to play . You can help others by telling your story and providing a willing hand to those in need . Being friends to others is the best way of being friends to ourselves . It is time , as Nancy said , for America to just say no to drugs . Those of you in union halls and workplaces everywhere Please make this challenge a part of your job every day . Help us preserve the health and dignity of all workers . To businesses large and small We need the creativity of your enterprise applied directly to this national problem . Help us . And those of you who are educators Your wisdom and leadership are indispensable to this cause . From the pulpits of this spirit filled land We would welcome your reassuring message of redemption and forgiveness and of helping one another . On the athletic fields You men and women are among the most beloved citizens of our country . A child s eyes fill with your heroic achievements . Few of us can give youngsters something as special and strong to look up to as you . Please do not let them down . And this camera in front of us It is a reminder that in Nancy s and my former profession and in the newsrooms and production rooms of our media centers you have a special opportunity with your enormous influence to send alarm signals across the Nation . To our friends in foreign countries We know many of you are involved in this battle with us . We need your success as well as ours . When we all come together , united , striving for this cause , then those who are killing America and terrorizing it with slow but sure chemical destruction will see that they are up against the mightiest force for good that we know . Then they will have no dark alleyways to hide in . In this crusade , let us not forget who we are . Drug abuse is a repudiation of everything America is . The destructiveness and human wreckage mock our heritage . Think for a moment how special it is to be an American . Can we doubt that only a divine providence placed this land , this island of freedom , here as a refuge for all those people on the world who yearn to breathe free The revolution out of which our liberty was conceived signaled an historical call to an entire world seeking hope . Each new arrival of immigrants rode the crest of that hope . They came , millions seeking a safe harbor from the oppression of cruel regimes . They came , to escape starvation and disease . They came , those surviving the Holocaust and the Soviet gulags . They came , the boat people , chancing death for even a glimmer of hope that they could have a new life . They all came to taste the air redolent and rich with the freedom that is ours . What an insult it will be to what we are and whence we came if we do not rise up together in defiance against this cancer of drugs . And there is one more thing . The freedom that so many seek in our land has not been preserved without a price . Nancy and I shared that remembrance 2 years ago at the Normandy American Cemetery in France . In the still of that June afternoon , we walked together among the soldiers of freedom , past the hundreds of white markers which are monuments to courage and memorials to sacrifice . Too many of these and other such graves are the final resting places of teenagers who became men in the roar of battle . Look what they gave to us who live . Never would they see another sunlit day glistening off a lake or river back home or miles of corn pushing up against the open sky of our plains . The pristine air of our mountains and the driving energy of our cities are theirs no more . Nor would they ever again be a son to their parents or a father to their own children . They did this for you , for me , for a new generation to carry our democratic experiment proudly forward . Well , that is something I think we are obliged to honor , because what they did for us means that we owe as a simple act of civic stewardship to use our freedom wisely for the common good . As we mobilize for this national crusade , I am mindful that drugs are a constant temptation for millions . Please remember this when your courage is tested You are Americans . You are the product of the freest society mankind has ever known . No one , ever , has the right to destroy your dreams and shatter your life . Right down the end of this hall is the Lincoln Bedroom . But in the Civil War that room was the one President Lincoln used as his office . Memory fills that room , and more than anything that memory drives us to see vividly what President Lincoln sought to save . Above all , it is that America must stand for something and that our heritage lets us stand with a strength of character made more steely by each layer of challenge pressed upon the Nation . We Americans have never been morally neutral against any form of tyranny . Tonight we are asking no more than that we honor what we have been and what we are by standing together . Reagan . Now we go on to the next stop making a final commitment not to tolerate drugs by anyone , anytime , anyplace . So , will not you join us in this great , new national crusade The President . God bless you , and good night .<speech_sep>Ladies and gentlemen , Chairman , reverend clergy , Mickey , I thank you very much for those very kind words , and I thank all of you for certainly a most hearty and warm welcome . I am grateful to the American Conservative Union , Young Americans for Freedom , National Review , and Human Events for organizing this third annual memorial service for the Democratic platform of 1980 . Someone asked me why I wanted to make it three in a row . Well , you know how the Irish love wakes . But I am delighted to be back here with you , at your 10th annual conference . In my last two addresses , I have talked about our common perceptions and goals , and I thought I might report to you here tonight on where we stand in achieving those goals a sort of state of the Reagan report , if you will . Now , I am the first to acknowledge that there is a good deal left unfinished on the conservative agenda . Our cleanup crew will need more than 2 years to deal with the mess left by others for over half a century . But I am not disheartened . In fact , my attitude about that unfinished agenda is not very different from that expressed in an anecdote about one of my favorite Presidents , Calvin Coolidge . Some of you may know that after Cal Coolidge was introduced to the sport of fishing by his Secret Service detail , it got to be quite a passion with him , if you can use that word about Silent Cal . Anyway , he was once asked by reporters how many fish were in one of his favorite angling places , the River Brule . And Coolidge said the waters were estimated to carry 45 , 000 trout . And then he said , I have not caught them all yet , but I sure have intimidated them . Well , it is true we have not brought about every change important to the conscience of a conservative , but we conservatives can take a great deal of honest pride in what we have achieved . In a few minutes I want to talk about just how far we have come and what we need to do to win further victories . But right now , I think a word or two on strategy is in order . You may remember that in the past , I mentioned that it was not our task as conservatives to just point out the mistakes made over all the decades of liberal government , not just to form an able opposition , but to govern , to lead a nation . And I noted this would make new demands upon our movement , upon all of us . For the first time in half a century , we have developed a whole new cadre of young conservatives in government . We have shown that conservatives can do more than criticize we have shown that we can govern and move our legislation through the Congress . Now , I know there is concern over attempts to roll back some of the gains that we have made . And it seems to me that here we ought to give some thought to strategy to making sure that we stop and think before we act . For example , some of our critics have been saying recently that they want to take back the people s third year tax cut and abolish tax indexing . And some others , including members of my staff , wanted immediately to open up a verbal barrage against them . Well , I hope you know that sometimes it is better if a President does not say exactly what is on his mind . There is an old story about a farmer and a lawyer that illustrates my point . It seems that these two got into a pretty bad collision , a traffic accident . They both got out of their cars . The farmer took one look at the lawyer , walked back to his car , got a package , brought it back . There was a bottle inside , and he said , Here , you look pretty shook up . I think you ought to take a nip of this , it will steady your nerves . Well , the lawyer did . And the farmer said , You still look a little bit pale . How about another And the lawyer took another swallow . And under the urging of the farmer , he took another and another and another . And then , finally , he said he was feeling pretty good and asked the farmer if he did not think that he ought to have a little nip , too . And the farmer said , Not me , I am waiting for the State trooper . I wonder if we cannot learn something from that farmer . If our liberal friends really want to head into the next election under the banner of taking away from the American people their first real tax cut in nearly 20 years if , after peering into their heart of hearts , they feel they must tell the American people that over the next 6 years they want to reduce the income of an average family by 3 , 000 and if they want to voice these deeply held convictions in an election year well , fellow conservatives , who are we to stifle the voices of conscience Now , in talking about our legislative agenda , I know that some of you have been disturbed by the notion of standby tax increases in the so called out years . Well , I was not wild about the idea myself . But the economy is getting better , and I believe these improvements are only the beginning . And with some luck , and if the American people respond with the kind of energy and initiative they have always shown in the past , well , maybe it is time we started thinking about some standby tax cuts , too . But you know , the great thing about that standby tax increase is that if it is passed , they cannot put it into effect unless they have first agreed to all our spending cuts . It does give them something to think about . But you know , with regard to the economy , I wonder if our political adversaries have not once again proved that they are our best allies . They spent the last 16 months or so placing all the responsibility for the state of the economy on our shoulders . And with some help from the media , it is been a pretty impressive campaign . They have created quite an image we are responsible for the economy . Well , I assume that we are responsible then for inflation which , after back to back years in double digits before we got here , has now been reduced to 3 . 9 percent in 1982 . And for the last 3 months of that year , it ran at only 1 . 1 percent . In 1982 real wages increased for the first time in 3 years . Interest rates , as you have already been told , have dropped dramatically , with the prime rate shrinking by nearly 50 percent . And in December , the index of leading indicators was a full 6 . 3 percent above last March s low point and has risen in 8 of the last 9 months . Last month housing starts were up 95 percent and building permits 88 percent over last year at this time . New home sales are up by 54 percent since April , and inventories of unsold homes are at the lowest levels in more than a decade . Auto production this quarter is scheduled to increase by 22 percent , and General Motors alone is putting 21 , 400 of their workers back on the job . Last month s sharp decline in the unemployment rate was the most heartening sign of all . It would have taken a 5 billion jobs bill to reduce unemployment by the same amount and it did not cost us anything . It is time to admit our guilt , time we admitted that our liberal critics have been right all the time . And they should go right on telling the American people that the state of the economy is precisely the fault of that wicked creature , Kemp Roth and its havoc breaking truth , Reaganomics . Let us confess , let us admit that we have turned the corner on the economy . And we are especially proud of one thing When we hit heavy weather , we did not panic , we did not go for fast bromides and quick fixes , the huge tax increases or wage and price controls recommended by so many . And our stubbornness , if you want to call it that , will quite literally pay off for every American in the years ahead . So , let me pledge to you tonight Carefully , we have set out on the road to recovery . We will not be deterred . We will not be turned back . I reject the policies of the past , the policies of tax and tax , spend and spend , elect and elect . The lesson of these failed policies is clear I have said this before You cannot drink yourself sober or spend yourself rich , and you cannot prime the pump without pumping the prime as somebody did , like to 21 percent in 1980 . And a word is in order here on the most historic of all the legislative reforms we have achieved in the last 2 years that of tax indexing . You can understand the terror that strikes in the heart of those whose principal constituency is big government . Bracket creep is government s hidden incentive to inflate the currency and bring on inflation , and indexing will end that . It will end those huge , hidden subsidies for bigger and bigger government . In the future , if we get indexing planted firmly as a law of the land , the advocates of big government who want money , more money for their social spending , their social engineering schemes , will have to go to the people and say right out loud We want more money from your weekly paycheck , so we are raising your taxes . Do that instead of sneaking it out by way of inflation , which they have helped bring on . So , all the professional Washingtonians , from bureaucrats to lobbyists to the special interest groups , are frightened plain scared and they are working overtime to take this one back . Well , I think I speak for all conservatives when I say Tax indexing is nonnegotiable . It is a fight we will take to the people , and we will win . But I think you can see how even this debate shows things are changing for the better . It highlights the essential differences between two philosophies now contending for power in American political life . One is the philosophy of the past a philosophy that has as its constituents an ill assorted mix of elitists and special interest groups who see government as the principal vehicle of social change , who believe that the only thing we have to fear is the people , who must be watched and regulated and superintended from Washington . On the other hand , our political philosophy is at the heart of the new political consensus that emerged in America at the beginning of this decade , one that I believe all well , I believe it will dominate American politics for many decades . The economic disasters brought about by too much government were the catalysts for this consensus . During the seventies , the American people began to see misdirected , overgrown government as the source of many of our social problems not the solution . This new consensus has a view of government that is essentially that of our Founding Fathers that government is the servant , not the master that it was meant to maintain order , to protect our nation s safety , but otherwise , in the words of that noted political philosopher , schnozzle Jimmy Durante , Do not put no constrictions on da people . Leave em da heck alone . The overriding goal during the past 2 years has been to give the government back to the American people , to make it responsive again to their wishes and desires , to do more than bring about a healthy economy or a growing gross national product . We have truly brought about a quiet revolution in American Government . For too many years , bureaucratic self interest and political maneuvering held sway over efficiency and honesty in government . Federal dollars were treated as the property of bureaucrats , not taxpayers . Those in the Federal Establishment who pointed to the misuse of those dollars were looked upon as malcontents or troublemakers . Well , this administration has broken with what was a kind of a buddy system . There have been dramatic turnabouts in some of the more scandal ridden and wasteful Federal agencies and programs . Only a few years ago , the General Services Administration was racked by indictments and report after report of inefficiency and waste . Today at GSJerry Carmen has not only put the whistle blowers back in charge , he is promoted them and given them new responsibilities . Just listen to this little set of figures . Today , General Services Administration work in progress time is down from 30 days to 7 , even while the agency has sustained budget cuts of 20 percent , office space reductions of 20 percent , and the attrition of 7 , 000 employees . At the Government Printing Office , under Dan Sawyer , losses of millions of dollars have suddenly been ended as the workforce was cut through attrition and a hiring freeze , and overtime pay was cut by 6 million in 1 year alone . The Government publication program , which ran a cumulative loss of 20 million over a 3 year period , registered a 4 . 9 million profit , and the GPO as a whole has experienced a profit of 4 . 1 million last year . It is said by some that this administration has turned a blind eye to waste and fraud at the Pentagon while overzealously concentrating on the social programs . Well , at the Pentagon , under Cap Weinberger s leadership and our superb service Secretaries , Jack Marsh , John Lehman , and Verne Orr , we have identified more than a billion dollars in savings on waste and fraud and , over the next 7 years , multiyear procurement and other acquisition initiatives will save us almost 30 billion . Now , these are only three examples of what we are attempting to do to make government more efficient . The list goes on . We have wielded our inspectors general as a strike force accounting for nearly 17 billion in savings in 18 months . With Peter Grace s help , we have called on top management executives and experts from the private sector to suggest modern management techniques for every aspect of government operations . And with an exciting new project called Reform 88 , we are going to streamline and reorganize the processes that control the money , information , personnel , and property of the Federal bureaucracy the maze through which nearly 2 trillion passes each year and which includes 350 different payroll systems and 1 , 750 personnel offices . There is more , much more from cutting down wasteful travel practices to reducing paperwork , from aggressively pursuing the 40 billion in bad debts owed the Federal Government to reducing publication of more than 70 million copies of wasteful or unnecessary government publications . But , you know , making government responsive again to the people involves more than eliminating waste and fraud and inefficiency . During the decades when government was intruding into areas where it is neither competent nor needed , it was also ignoring its legitimate and constitutional duties such as preserving the domestic peace and providing for the common defense . I will talk about defense in a moment . I know you have already heard about that today , some of you . But on the matter of domestic order , a few things need to be said . First of all , it is abundantly clear that much of our crime problem was provoked by a social philosophy that saw man as primarily a creature of his material environment . The same liberal philosophy that saw an era of prosperity and virtue ushered in by changing man s environment through massive Federal spending programs also viewed criminals as the unfortunate products of poor socioeconomic conditions or an underprivileged upbringing . Society , not the individual , they said , was at fault for criminal wrongdoing . We were to blame . Well , today , a new political consensus utterly rejects this point of view . The American people demand that government exercise its legitimate and constitutional duty to punish career criminals those who consciously choose to make their life by preying on the innocent . Now , we conservatives have been warning about the crime problem for many years , about that permissive social philosophy that did so much to foster it , about a legal system that seemed to specialize in letting hardened criminals go free . And now we have the means and the power to do something . Let us get to work . Drugpusher after drugpusher , mobster after mobster has escaped justice by taking advantage of our flawed bail and parole system . Criminals who have committed atrocious acts have cynically utilized the technicalities of the exclusionary rule , a miscarriage of justice unique to our legal system . Indeed , one National Institute of Justice study showed that of those arrested for drug felonies in Los Angeles County in 1981 , 32 percent were back out on the streets because of perceived problems with the exclusionary rule . Now , the exclusionary rule that is not a law that was passed by Congress or a State legislature , it is what is called case law , the result of judicial decisions . If a law enforcement officer obtains evidence as the result of a violation of the laws regarding search and seizure , that evidence cannot be introduced in a trial even if it proves the guilt of the accused . Now , this is hardly punishment of the officer for his violation of legal procedures , and it is only effect , in many cases , is to free someone patently guilty of a crime . I do not know , maybe I have told you this before , but I have to give you a glaring example of what I have taken too much time to explain here . San Bernardino , California , several years ago Two narcotics agents , based on the evidence that they had , obtained a legal warrant to search a home of a man and woman suspected of peddling heroin . They searched the home . They did not find anything . But as they were leaving , just on a hunch , they turned back to the baby in the crib and took down the diapers , and there was the stash of heroin . The evidence was thrown out of court and the couple went free because the baby had not given permission for the violation of its constitutional rights . Well , this administration has proposed vital reforms of our bail and parole systems and criminal forfeiture and sentencing statutes . These reforms were passed by the Senate 95 to 1 last year . Our anticrime package never got out of committee in the House of Representatives . Do you see a target there The American people want these reforms , and they want them now . I am asking tonight that you mobilize all the powerful resources of this political movement to get these measures passed by the Congress . On another front , all of you know how vitally important it is for us to reverse the decline in American education , to take responsibility for the education of our children out of the hands of the bureaucrats and put it back in the hands of parents and teachers . That is why the Congress must stop dithering . We need those tuition tax credits . We need a voucher system for the parents of disadvantaged children . We need education savings accounts , a sort of IRA for college . And finally and do not think for a moment I have given up we need to eliminate that unnecessary and politically engendered Department of Education . There are other steps we are taking to restore government to its rightful duties , to restore the political consensus upon which this nation was founded . Our Founding Fathers prohibited a Federal establishment of religion , but there is no evidence that they intended to set up a wall of separation between the state and religious belief itself . The evidence of this is all around us . In the Declaration of Independence , alone , there are no fewer than four mentions of a Supreme Being . In God We Trust is engraved on our coinage . The Supreme Court opens its proceedings with a religious invocation . And the Congress opens each day with prayer from its chaplains . The schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same privileges as Supreme Court Justices and Congressmen . Join me in persuading the Congress to accede to the overwhelming desire of the American people for a constitutional amendment permitting prayer in our schools . And finally , on our domestic agenda , there is a subject that weighs heavily on all of us the tragedy of abortion on demand . This is a grave moral evil and one that requires the fullest discussion on the floors of the House and Senate . As we saw in the last century with the issue of slavery , any attempt by the Congress to stifle or compromise away discussion of important moral issues only further inflames emotions on both sides and leads ultimately to even more social disruption and disunity . So , tonight , I would ask that the Congress discuss the issue of abortion openly and freely on the floors of the House and Senate . Let those who believe the practice of abortion to be a moral evil join us in taking this case to our fellow Americans . And let us do so rationally , calmly , and with an honest regard for our fellow Americans . Speaking for myself , I believe that once the implications of abortion on demand are fully aired and understood by the American people , they will resolutely seek its abolition . Now , I know there are many who sincerely believe that limiting the right of abortion violates the freedom of choice of the individual . But if the unborn child is a living entity , then there are two individuals , each with the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Unless and until someone can prove the unborn is not alive and all medical evidence indicates it is then we must concede the benefit of the doubt to the unborn infant . But whether it is cutting spending and taxing , shrinking the size of the deficit , ending overregulation , inefficiency , fraud , and waste in government , cracking down on career criminals , revitalizing American education , pressing for prayer and abortion legislation , I think you can see that the agenda we have put before America these past 2 years has been a conservative one . Oh , and there are two other matters that I think you had be interested in . First , as part of our federalism effort , next week we will be sending to the Congress our proposal for four megablock grants that will return vital prerogatives to the States where they belong . And second , the Office of Management and Budget will press ahead with new regulations prohibiting the use of Federal tax dollars for purposes of political advocacy . And these important domestic initiatives have been complemented by the conservative ideas we have brought to the pursuit of foreign policy . In the struggle now going on for the world , we have not been afraid to characterize our adversaries for what they are . We have focused world attention on forced labor on the Soviet pipeline and Soviet repression in Poland and all the other nations that make up what is called the fourth world those living under totalitarian rule who long for freedom . We publicized the evidence of chemical warfare and other atrocities in Cambodia , which we are now supposed to call Kampuchea , and in Afghanistan . We pointed out that totalitarian powers hold a radically different view of morality and human dignity than we do . We must develop a forward strategy for freedom , one based on our hope that someday representative government will be enjoyed by all the people and all the nations of the Earth . We have been striving to give the world the facts about the international arms race . Ever since our nearly total demobilization after World War Iwe in the West have been playing catchup . Yes , there is been an international arms race , as some of the declared Democratic candidates for the Presidency tell us . But let them also tell us , there is only been one side doing the racing . Those of you in the frontline of the conservative movement can be of special assistance in furthering our strategy for freedom , our fight against totalitarianism . First of all , there is no more important foreign policy initiative in this administration , and none that frightens our adversaries more , than our attempts through our international radios to build constituencies for peace in nations dominated by totalitarian , militaristic regimes . We have proposed to the Congress modest but vitally important expenditures for the Voice of America , Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty , and Radio Marti . These proposals stalled last year , but with your help we can get them through the Congress this year . And believe me , nothing could mean more to the Poles , Lithuanians , Cubans , and all the millions of others living in that fourth world . Now , it would be also unconscionable during any discussion of the need for candor in our foreign policy not to mention here the tragic event that last year shocked the world the attack on His Holiness , Pope John Paul II an act of unspeakable evil , an assault on man and God . It was an international outrage and merits the fullest possible investigation . Tonight , I want to take this opportunity to applaud the courage and resourcefulness of the Government of Italy in bringing this matter to the attention of the world . And , contrary to what some have suggested , you can depend on it , there is no one on our side that is acting embarrassed or feeling embarrassed because they are going ahead with that investigation . We mean to help them . And , now , Cap , you can breathe easy , because here we come . We must continue to revitalize and strengthen our Armed Forces . Cap Weinberger s been waging an heroic s battle on this front . I am asking you , the conservative leaders here tonight , to make support for our defense buildup one of your top priorities . But besides progress in furthering all of these items on the conservative agenda , something else is occurring something that someday we conservatives may be very proud happened under our leadership . Even with all our recent economic hardships , I believe a feeling of optimism is now entering the American consciousness , a belief that the days of division and discord are behind us and that an era of unity and national renewal is upon us . A vivid reminder of how our nation has learned and grown and transcended the tragedies of the past was given to us here in Washington only a few months ago . Last November , on the Mall , between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument , a new memorial was dedicated one of dark , low lying walls inscribed with the names of those who gave their lives in the Vietnam conflict . Soon , there will be added a sculpture of three infantrymen representing different racial and ethnic backgrounds . During the dedication ceremonies , the rolls of the missing and dead were read for 3 days , morning till night , in a candlelight ceremony at the National Cathedral . And those veterans of Vietnam who were never welcomed home with speeches and bands , but who were undefeated in battle and were heroes as surely as any who ever fought in a noble cause , staged their own parade on Constitution Avenue . As America watched them , some in wheelchairs , all of them proud , there was a feeling that as a nation we were coming together , coming together again , and that we had at long last brought the boys home . A lot of healing . . . went on , said Jan Scruggs , the wounded combat veteran who helped organize support for the memorial . And then there was this newspaper account that appeared after the ceremonies . I had like to read it to you . Yesterday , crowds returned to the memorial . Among them was Herbie Petit , a machinist and former marine from New Orleans . Last night , he said , standing near the wall , I went out to dinner with some ex marines . There was also a group of college students in the restaurant . We started talking to each other , and before we left , they stood up and cheered . The whole week , Petit said , his eyes red , it was worth it just for that . It has been worth it . We Americans have learned again to listen to each other , to trust each other . We have learned that government owes the people an explanation and needs their support for its actions at home and abroad . And we have learned and I pray this time for good that we must never again send our young men to fight and die in conflicts that our leaders are not prepared to win . Thank you very much . Yet , the most valuable lesson of all , the preciousness of human freedom , has been relearned not just by Americans but all the people of the world . It is the stark lesson that Truongs Nhu Tang , one of the founders of the National Liberation Front , a former Viet Cong minister and vice minister of the postwar Vietnamese Communist government , spoke of recently when he explained why he fled Vietnam for freedom . No previous regime in my country , he wrote about the concentration camps and boat people of Vietnam , brought such numbers of people to such desperation . Not the military dictators , not the colonialists , not even the ancient Chinese warlords . It is a lesson that my compatriots and I learned through witnessing and through suffering in our own lives the fate of our countrymen . It is a lesson that must eventually move the conscience of the world . This man who had fought on the other side learned the value of freedom only after helping to destroy it and seeing those who had had to give it up . The task that has fallen to us as Americans is to move the conscience of the world , to keep alive the hope and dream of freedom . For if we fail or falter , there ll be no place for the world s oppressed to flee to . This is not a role we sought . We preach no manifest destiny . But like the Americans who brought a new nation into the world 200 years ago , history has asked much of us in our time . Much we have already given much more we must be prepared to give . This is not a task we shrink from it is a task we welcome . For with the privilege of living in this kindly , pleasant , greening land called America , this land of generous spirit and great ideals , there is also a destiny and a duty , a duty to preserve and hold in sacred trust mankind s age old aspirations of peace and freedom and a better life for generations to come . God bless you all , and thank you for what you are doing .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , distinguished Members of the Congress , honored guests , and fellow citizens This solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a President of the United States has reported on the State of the Union since George Washington first did so in 1790 . That is a lot of reports , but there is no shortage of new things to say about the State of the Union . The very key to our success has been our ability , foremost among nations , to preserve our lasting values by making change work for us rather than against us . I would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do together not as Republicans and Democrats , but as Americans to make tomorrow s America happy and prosperous at home , strong and respected abroad , and at peace in the world . As we gather here tonight , the state of our Union is strong , but our economy is troubled . For too many of our fellow citizens farmers , steel and auto workers , lumbermen , black teenagers , working mothers this is a painful period . We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end . It has fallen to us , in our time , to undo damage that was a long time in the making , and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a better future for ourselves and our children . We have a long way to go , but thanks to the courage , patience , and strength of our people , America is on the mend . But let me give you just one important reason why I believe this it involves many members of this body . Just 10 days ago , after months of debate and deadlock , the bipartisan Commission on Social Security accomplished the seemingly impossible . Social security , as some of us had warned for so long , faced disaster . myself , have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years . As 1983 began , the system stood on the brink of bankruptcy , a double victim of our economic ills . First , a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living . Then the recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the expanding wage base and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 million Americans who depend on it . When the Speaker of the House , the Senate majority leader , and I performed the bipartisan or formed the bipartisan Commission on Social Security , pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflicting interests would prevent the Commission from agreeing on a plan to save social security . Well , sometimes , even here in Washington , the cynics are wrong . Through compromise and cooperation , the members of the Commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair , workable plan . They proved that , when it comes to the national welfare , Americans can still pull together for the common good . Tonight , I am especially pleased to join with the Speaker and the Senate majority leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter . There are elements in it , of course , that none of us prefers , but taken together it performs a package that all of us can support . It asks for some sacrifice by all the self employed , beneficiaries , workers , government employees , and the better off among the retired but it imposes an undue burden on none . And , in supporting it , we keep an important pledge to the American people The integrity of the social security system will be preserved , and no one s payments will be reduced . The Commission s plan will do the job indeed , it must do the job . We owe it to today s older Americans and today s younger workers . So , before we go any further , I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the Commission who are here tonight and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and Speaker Tip O Neill for a job well done . I hope and pray the bipartisan spirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face the challenges of the year ahead . Nearly half a century ago , in this Chamber , another American President , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , in his second State of the Union message , urged America to look to the future , to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that looks forward , not backward . Throughout the world , he said , change is the order of the day . In every nation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared . He also reminded us that the future lies with those wise political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in Government than in politics . So , let us , in these next two years men and women of both parties , every political shade concentrate on the long range , bipartisan responsibilities of government , not the short range or short term temptations of partisan politics . The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected the recession was deeper than most inside and out of government had predicted . Curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted . Unemployment is far too high . Projected Federal spending if government refuses to tighten its own belt will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway . This recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spending for consumer items and capital goods the stimulus we need to restart our stalled economic engines . The American people have already stepped up their rate of saving , assuring that the funds needed to modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry . The inflationary expectations that led to a 21 1 2 percent interest prime rate and soaring mortgage rates 2 years ago are now reduced by almost half . Leaders have started to realize that double digit inflation is no longer a way of life . I misspoke there . I should have said lenders . So , interest rates have tumbled , paving the way for recovery in vital industries like housing and autos . The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in . Housing starts for the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year ago , and housing permits , a sure indicator of future growth , were up a whopping 60 percent . We are witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that American industry will once again become competitive in markets at home and abroad , ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the Nation s work force . But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience . Quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we have now paid such a heavy price to cure . The permanent recovery in employment , production , and investment we seek will not come in a sharp , short spurt . It will build carefully and steadily in the months and years ahead . In the meantime , the challenge of government is to identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the American people . The federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems . Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending , we could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future . Failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next four years alone . That would average 4 , 300 in additional debt for every man , woman , child , and baby in our nation . To assure a sustained recovery , we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down . If we do not , the recovery will be too short , unemployment will remain too high , and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children . That we must not do . Let us be clear about where the deficit problem comes from . Contrary to the drumbeat we have been hearing for the last few months , the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending . Taken as a percentage of the gross national product , our defense spending happens to be only about four fifths of what it was in 1970 . Nor is the deficit , as some would have it , rooted in tax cuts . Even with our tax cuts , taxes as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as they were in 1970 . The fact is , our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending . During the 1970 s , the share of our national income devoted to this domestic spending increased by more than 60 percent , from 10 cents out of every dollar produced by the American people to 16 cents . In spite of all our economies and efficiencies , and without adding any new programs , basic , necessary domestic spending provided for in this year s budget will grow to almost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years . The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our Republic . We need a plan to overcome this danger a plan based on these principles . It must be bipartisan . Conquering the deficits and putting the Government s house in order will require the best effort of all of us . It must be fair . Just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery , all would share fairly in the burden of transition . It must be prudent . The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy . And finally , it must be realistic . We cannot rely on hope alone . With these guiding principles in mind , let me outline a four part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits . First , in my budget message , I will recommend a Federal spending freeze . I know this is strong medicine , but so far , we have only cut the rate of increase in Federal spending . The Government has continued to spend more money each year , though not as much more as it did in the past . Taken as a whole , the budget I am proposing for the fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation . In other words , the Federal Government will hold the line on real spending . Now , that is far less than many American families have had to do in these difficult times . I will request that the proposed 6 month freeze in cost of living adjustments recommended by the bipartisan Social Security Commission be applied to other government related retirement programs . I will , also , propose a 1 year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs , and for Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs . And let me say right here , I am sorry , with regard to the military , in asking that of them , because for so many years they have been so far behind and so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing . But I am sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair . Second , I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so called uncontrollable spending programs . These are the automatic spending programs , such as food stamps , that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970 . They are the largest single cause of the built in or structural deficit problem . Our standard here will be fairness , ensuring that the taxpayers hard earned dollars go only to the truly needy that none of them are turned away , but that fraud and waste are stamped out . And I am sorry to say , there is a lot of it out there . In the food stamp program alone , last year , we identified almost 1 . 1 billion in overpayments . The taxpayers are not the only victims of this kind of abuse . The truly needy suffer as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy , but by the greedy . For everyone s sake , we must put an end to such waste and corruption . Third , I will adjust our program to restore America s defenses by proposing 55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years . These are savings recommended to me by the Secretary of Defense , who has assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms reductions or endanger America s security . We will not gamble with our national survival . And fourth , because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficits over the next several years , I will propose a standby tax , limited to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product , to start in fiscal 1986 . It would last no more than 3 years , and it would start only if the Congress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program . And there are several other conditions also that must be met , all of them in order for this program to be triggered . Now , you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future , a remedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutely necessary . In the meantime , we will continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all Americans . This is a goal that every American who is ever struggled with a tax form can understand . At the same time , however , I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax reforms that we have already enacted , including the 10 percent tax break coming to taxpayers this July and the tax indexing which will protect all Americans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead . Now , I realize that this four part plan is easier to describe than it will be to enact . But the looming deficits that hang over us and over America s future must be reduced . The path I have outlined is fair , balanced , and realistic . If enacted , it will ensure a steady decline in deficits , aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade . It is the only path that will lead to a strong , sustained recovery . Let us follow that path together . No domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable , permanent jobs for all Americans who want to work . The recovery program will provide jobs for most , but others will need special help and training for new skills . Shortly , I will submit to the Congress the Employment Act of 1983 , designed to get at the special problems of the long term unemployed , as well as young people trying to enter the job market . I will propose extending unemployment benefits , including special incentives to employers who hire the long term unemployed , providing programs for displaced workers , and helping federally funded and State administered unemployment insurance programs provide workers with training and relocation assistance . Finally , our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market . We must offer both short term help and long term hope for our unemployed . I hope we can work together on this . I hope we can work together as we did last year in enacting the landmark Job Training Partnership Act . Regulatory reform legislation , a responsible clean air act , and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity . One of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade . So , I will propose a broader strategy in the field of international trade one that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to America s farmers and workers in the world marketplace . We must have adequate export financing to sell American products overseas . I will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets . We must strengthen the organization of our trade agencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international trade policy to promote free trade and the increased flow of American goods , services , and investments . Our trade position can also be improved by making our port system more efficient . Better , more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our coalfields , railroads , trucking industry , and ports . After 2 years of debate , it is time for us to get together and enact a port modernization bill . Education , training , and retraining are fundamental to our success as are research and development and productivity . Labor , management , and government at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools of growth . Tax policy , regulatory practices , and government programs all need constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness . Every American has a role and a stake in international trade . We Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields . We must keep that edge , and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics starting with our educational system . While we grew complacent , others have acted . Japan , with a population only about half the size of ours , graduates from its universities more engineers than we do . If a child does not receive adequate math and science teaching by the age of 16 , he or she has lost the chance to be a scientist or an engineer . We must join together parents , teachers , grass roots groups , organized labor , and the business community to revitalize American education by setting a standard of excellence . In 1983 we seek four major education goals a quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the States establishment of education savings accounts that will give middle and lower income families an incentive to save for their children s college education and , at the same time , encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private or religiously affiliated schools a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer . God should never have been expelled from America s classrooms in the first place . Our commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economic equity for women , and eliminate , once and for all , all traces of unjust discrimination against women from the United States Code . We will not tolerate wage discrimination based on sex , and we intend to strengthen enforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents , most of whom are women , do not suffer unfair financial hardship . We will also take action to remedy inequities in pensions . These initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women . Also in the area of fairness and equity , we will ask for extension of the Civil Rights Commission , which is due to expire this year . The Commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America , and we strongly support its reauthorization . Effective enforcement of our nation s fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity . In the year ahead , we will work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for all Americans . The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking . It is high time that we make our cities safe again . This administration hereby declares an all out war on big time organized crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people . We will also implement recommendations of our Task Force on Victims of Crime , which will report to me this week . American agriculture , the envy of the world , has become the victim of its own successes . With one farmer now producing enough food to feed himself and 77 other people , America is confronted with record surplus crops and commodity prices below the cost of production . We must strive , through innovations like the payment in kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy , to restore health and vitality to rural America . Meanwhile , I have instructed the Department of Agriculture to work individually with farmers with debt problems to help them through these tough times . Over the past year , our Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives has successfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business , labor , education , and government to address the training needs of American workers . Thanks to the Task Force , private sector initiatives are now underway in all 50 States of the Union , and thousands of working people have been helped in making the shift from dead end jobs and low demand skills to the growth areas of high technology and the service economy . Additionally , a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community child care . The new advisory council on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in 1983 . In the coming year , we will also act to improve the quality of life for Americans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becoming an unbearable financial burden for so many . And we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older Americans . I will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will continue our efforts to restore to States and local governments their roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society . During the next several weeks , I will send to the Congress a series of detailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working with you on the development of these initiatives . So far , now , I have concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future . But in almost every home and workplace in America , we are already witnessing reason for great hope the first flowering of the manmade miracles of high technology , a field pioneered and still led by our country . To many of us now , computers , silicon chips , data processing , cybernetics , and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as mystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when that first Model T rattled down Main Street , S . But as surely as America s pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century , the same pioneer spirit today is opening up on another vast front of opportunity , the frontier of high technology . In conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional industries , but we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of tomorrow . This administration is committed to keeping America the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century . But let us turn briefly to the international arena . America s leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society free elections , a free press , freedom of religious choice , free trade unions , and above all , freedom for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state . These values are the bedrock of our strength . They unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in NATin Asia , in Latin America , and elsewhere . They are also the values which in the recent past some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye . Fortunately , we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our common democratic values , and we are applying them as a cornerstone of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom . In London last year , I announced the commitment of the United States to developing the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world . We intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously . The future belongs not to governments and ideologies which oppress their peoples , but to democratic systems of self government which encourage individual initiative and guarantee personal freedom . But our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on strength economic strength and military strength . A strong American economy is essential to the well being and security of our friends and allies . The restoration of a strong , healthy American economy has been and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy . The progress I have been able to report to you tonight will , I know , be as warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the American people . We must also recognize that our own economic well being is inextricably linked to the world economy . We export over 20 percent of our industrial production , and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export . We will continue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of Europe and Japan and with the International Monetary Fund to ensure it has adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong , noninflationary growth . As the leader of the West and as a country that has become great and rich because of economic freedom , America must be an unrelenting advocate of free trade . As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism , our strategy cannot be to follow them , but to lead the way toward freer trade . To this end , in May of this year America will host an economic summit meeting in Williamsburg , Virginia . As we begin our third year , we have put in place a defense program that redeems the neglect of the past decade . We have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails . Our Armed Forces are finally properly paid after years of neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and supplied . And the American uniform is once again worn with pride . Most of the major systems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway , and we will be addressing one key system , the MX missile , in consultation with the Congress in a few months . America s foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship , on realism , strength , full partnership , in consultation with our allies , and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries . From the Middle East to southern Africa to Geneva , American diplomats are taking the initiative to make peace and lower arms levels . We should be proud of our role as peacemakers . In the Middle East last year , the United States played the major role in ending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut . Last September , I outlined principles to carry on the peace process begun so promisingly at Camp David . All the people of the Middle East should know that in the year ahead we will not flag in our efforts to build on that foundation to bring them the blessings of peace . In Central America and the Caribbean Basin , we are likewise engaged in a partnership for peace , prosperity , and democracy . Final passage of the remaining portions of our Caribbean Basin Initiative , which passed the House last year , is one of this administration s top legislative priorities for 1983 . The security and economic assistance policies of this administration in Latin America and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race . This undertaking is a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches , and I am counting on the cooperation and statesmanship of the Congress to help us meet this essential foreign policy goal . At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the Soviet Union . The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership . We are prepared for a positive change in Soviet American relations . But the Soviet Union must show by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to respect the rights and sovereignty of the family of nations . Responsible members of the world community do not threaten or invade their neighbors . And they restrain their allies from aggression . For our part , we are vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with the Soviet Union . Supported by our allies , we have put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels . We insist on an equal balance of forces . And given the overwhelming evidence of Soviet violations of international treaties concerning chemical and biological weapons , we also insist that any agreement we sign can and will be verifiable . In the case of intermediate range nuclear forces , we have proposed the complete elimination of the entire class of land based missiles . We are also prepared to carefully explore serious Soviet proposals . At the same time , let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions . With firmness and dedication , we will continue to negotiate . Deep down , the Soviets must know it is in their interest as well as ours to prevent a wasteful arms race . And once they recognize our unshakable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence , they will have every reason to join us in the search for greater security and major arms reductions . When that moment comes and I am confident that it will we will have taken an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world s people . A very wise man , Bernard Baruch , once said that America has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path . Our country is a special place , because we Americans have always been sustained , through good times and bad , by a noble vision a vision not only of what the world around us is today but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow . We are realists we solve our problems instead of ignoring them , no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us . But we are also idealists , for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner of the world . Right now we need both realism and idealism . Millions of our neighbors are without work . It is up to us to see they are not without hope . This is a task for all of us . And may I say , Americans have rallied to this cause , proving once again that we are the most generous people on Earth . We who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy . And here all that time , I thought you were reading the paper . The single thing the single thing that can start the wheels of industry turning again is further reduction of interest rates . Just another 1 or 2 points can mean tens of thousands of jobs . Right now , with inflation as low as it is , 3 . 9 percent , there is room for interest rates to come down . Only fear prevents their reduction . A lender , as we know , must charge an interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollars loaned . And that depreciation is , of course , the amount of inflation . Today , interest rates are based on fear fear that government will resort to measures , as it has in the past , that will send inflation zooming again . We who serve here in this Capital must erase that fear by making it absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation that , together , we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth . Yes , the problems confronting us are large and forbidding . And , certainly , no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends and neighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment . But we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful . Back over the years , citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened sometimes when its very existence was at stake . Always with courage and common sense , they met the crises of their time and lived to see a stronger , better , and more prosperous country . The present situation is no worse and , in fact , is not as bad as some of those they faced . Time and again , they proved that there is nothing we Americans cannot achieve as free men and women . Yes , we still have problems plenty of them . But it is just plain wrong unjust to our country and unjust to our people to let those problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all America is on the mend . We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can . No one can quarrel with that . We must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis . But the big story about America today is the way that millions of confident , caring people those extraordinary ordinary Americans who never make the headlines and will never be interviewed are laying the foundation , not just for recovery from our present problems but for a better tomorrow for all our people . From coast to coast , on the job and in classrooms and laboratories , at new construction sites and in churches and community groups , neighbors are helping neighbors . And they have already begun the building , the research , the work , and the giving that will make our country great again . I believe this , because I believe in them in the strength of their hearts and minds , in the commitment that each one of them brings to their daily lives , be they high or humble . The challenge for us in government is to be worthy of them to make government a help , not a hindrance to our people in the challenging but promising days ahead . If we do that , if we care what our children and our children s children will say of us , if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did here in these temples of freedom , we will work together to make America better for our having been here not just in this year or this decade but in the next century and beyond . Thank you , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , distinguished Members of the Congress , honored guests , and my fellow Americans A number of times in past years , Members of Congress and a President have come together in meetings like this to resolve a crisis . I have asked for this meeting in the hope that we can prevent one . It would be hard to find many Americans who are not aware of our stake in the Middle East , the Persian Gulf , or the NATO line dividing the free world from the Communist bloc . And the same could be said for Asia . But in spite of , or maybe because of , a flurry of stories about places like Nicaragua and El Salvador and , yes , some concerted propaganda , many of us find it hard to believe we have a stake in problems involving those countries . Too many have thought of Central America as just that place way down below Mexico that cannot possibly constitute a threat to our well being . And that is why I have asked for this session . Central America s problems do directly affect the security and the well being of our own people . And Central America is much closer to the United States than many of the world troublespots that concern us . So , we work to restore our own economy we cannot afford to lose sight of our neighbors to the south . El Salvador is nearer to Texas than Texas is to Massachusetts . Nicaragua is just as close to Miami , San Antonio , San Diego , and Tucson as those cities are to Washington , where we are gathered tonight . But nearness on the map does not even begin to tell the strategic importance of Central America , bordering as it does on the Caribbean our lifeline to the outside world . Two thirds of all our foreign trade and petroleum pass through the Panama Canal and the Caribbean . In a European crisis at least half of our supplies for NATO would go through these areas by sea . It is well to remember that in early 1942 , a handful of Hitler s submarines sank more tonnage there than in all of the Atlantic Ocean . And they did this without a single naval base anywhere in the area . And today , the situation is different . Cuba is host to a Soviet combat brigade , a submarine base capable of servicing Soviet submarines , and military air bases visited regularly by Soviet military aircraft . Because of its importance , the Caribbean Basin is a magnet for adventurism . We are all aware of the Libyan cargo planes refueling in Brazil a few days ago on their way to deliver medical supplies to Nicaragua . Brazilian authorities discovered the so called medical supplies were actually munitions and prevented their delivery . You may remember that last month , speaking on national television , I showed an aerial photo of an airfield being built on the island of Grenada . Well , if that airfield had been completed , those planes could have refueled there and completed their journey . If the Nazis during World War II and the Soviets today could recognize the Caribbean and Central America as vital to our interests , should not we , also For several years now , under two administrations , the United States has been increasing its defense of freedom in the Caribbean Basin . And I can tell you tonight , democracy is beginning to take root in El Salvador , which , until a short time ago , knew only dictatorship . The new government is now delivering on its promises of democracy , reforms , and free elections . It was not easy , and there was resistance to many of the attempted reforms , with assassinations of some of the reformers . Guerrilla bands and urban terrorists were portrayed in a worldwide propaganda campaign as freedom fighters , representative of the people . Ten days before I came into office , the guerrillas launched what they called a final offensive to overthrow the government . And their radio boasted that our new administration would be too late to prevent their victory . Well , they learned that democracy cannot be so easily defeated . President Carter did not hesitate . He authorized arms and munitions to El Salvador . The guerrilla offensive failed , but not America s will . Every President since this country assumed global responsibilities has known that those responsibilities could only be met if we pursued a bipartisan foreign policy . As I said a moment ago , the Government of El Salvador has been keeping its promises , like the land reform program which is making thousands of farm tenants , farm owners . In a little over 3 years , 20 percent of the arable land in El Salvador has been redistributed to more than 450 , 000 people . That is one in ten Salvadorans who have benefited directly from this program . El Salvador has continued to strive toward an orderly and democratic society . The government promised free elections . On March 28th , a little more than a year ago , after months of campaigning by a variety of candidates , the suffering people of El Salvador were offered a chance to vote , to choose the kind of government they wanted . And suddenly , the so called freedom fighters in the hills were exposed for what they really are a small minority who want power for themselves and their backers , not democracy for the people . The guerrillas threatened death to anyone who voted . They destroyed hundreds of buses and trucks to keep the people from getting to the polling places . Their slogan was brutal Vote today , die tonight . But on election day , an unprecedented 80 percent of the electorate braved ambush and gunfire and trudged for miles , many of them , to vote for freedom . Now , that is truly fighting for freedom . We can never turn our backs on that . Members of this Congress who went there as observers told me of a woman who was wounded by rifle fire on the way to the polls , who refused to leave the line to have her wound treated until after she had voted . Another woman had been told by the guerrillas that she would be killed when she returned from the polls , and she told the guerrillas , You can kill me , you can kill my family , you can kill my neighbors . You cannot kill us all . The real freedom fighters of El Salvador turned out to be the people of that country the young , the old , the in between more than a million of them out of a population of less than 5 million . The world should respect this courage and not allow it to be belittled or forgotten . And again I say , in good conscience , we can never turn our backs on that . The democratic political parties and factions in El Salvador are coming together around the common goal of seeking a political solution to their country s problems . New national elections will be held this year , and they will be open to all political parties . The government has invited the guerrillas to participate in the election and is preparing an amnesty law . The people of El Salvador are earning their freedom , and they deserve our moral and material support to protect it . Yes , there are still major problems regarding human rights , the criminal justice system , and violence against noncombatants . And , like the rest of Central America , El Salvador also faces severe economic problems . But in addition to recession depressed prices for major agricultural exports , El Salvador s economy is being deliberately sabotaged . Tonight in El Salvador because of ruthless guerrilla attacks much of the fertile land cannot be cultivated less than half the rolling stock of the railways remains operational bridges , water facilities , telephone and electric systems have been destroyed and damaged . In one 22 month period , there were 5 , 000 interruptions of electrical power . One region was without electricity for a third of the year . I think Secretary of State Shultz put it very well the other day Unable to win the free loyalty of El Salvador s people , the guerrillas , he said , are deliberately and systematically depriving them of food , water , transportation , light , sanitation , and jobs . And these are the people who claim they want to help the common people . They do not want elections because they know they had be defeated . But , as the previous election showed , the Salvadoran people s desire for democracy will not be defeated . The guerrillas are not embattled peasants , armed with muskets . They are professionals , sometimes with better training and weaponry than the government s soldiers . The Salvadoran battalions that have received training have been conducting themselves well on the battlefield and with the civilian population . But so far , we have only provided enough money to train one Salvadoran soldier out of ten , fewer than the number of guerrillas that are trained by Nicaragua and Cuba . And let me set the record straight on Nicaragua , a country next to El Salvador . In 1979 when the new government took over in Nicaragua , after a revolution which overthrew the authoritarian rule of Somoza , everyone hoped for the growth of democracy . We in the United States did , too . By January of 1981 , our emergency relief and recovery aid to Nicaragua totalled 118 million more than provided by any other developed country . In fact , in the first 2 years of Sandinista rule , the United States directly or indirectly sent five times more aid to Nicaragua than it had in the 2 years prior to the revolution . Can anyone doubt the generosity and the good faith of the American people These were hardly the actions of a nation implacably hostile to Nicaragua . Yet , the Government of Nicaragua has treated us as an enemy . It has rejected our repeated peace efforts . It has broken its promises to us , to the Organization of American States and , most important of all , to the people of Nicaragua . No sooner was victory achieved than a small clique ousted others who had been part of the revolution from having any voice in the government . Humberto Ortega , the Minister of Defense , declared Marxism Leninism would be their guide , and so it is . The Government of Nicaragua has imposed a new dictatorship . It has refused to hold the elections it promised . It has seized control of most media and subjects all media to heavy prior censorship . It denied the bishops and priests of the Roman Catholic Church the right to say Mass on radio during Holy Week . It insulted and mocked the Pope . It has driven the Miskito Indians from their homelands , burning their villages , destroying their crops , and forcing them into involuntary internment camps far from home . It has moved against the private sector and free labor unions . It condoned mob action against Nicaragua s independent human rights commission and drove the director of that commission into exile . In short , after all these acts of repression by the government , is it any wonder that opposition has formed Contrary to propaganda , the opponents of the Sandinistas are not diehard supporters of the previous Somoza regime . In fact , many are anti Somoza heroes and fought beside the Sandinistas to bring down the Somoza government . Now they have been denied any part in the new government because they truly wanted democracy for Nicaragua and they still do . Others are Miskito Indians fighting for their homes , their lands , and their lives . The Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua turned out to be just an exchange of one set of autocratic rulers for another , and the people still have no freedom , no democratic rights , and more poverty . Even worse than its predecessor , it is helping Cuba and the Soviets to destabilize our hemisphere . Meanwhile , the Government of El Salvador , making every effort to guarantee democracy , free labor unions , freedom of religion , and a free press , is under attack by guerrillas dedicated to the same philosophy that prevails in Nicaragua , Cuba , and , yes , the Soviet Union . Violence has been Nicaragua s most important export to the world . It is the ultimate in hypocrisy for the unelected Nicaraguan Government to charge that we seek their overthrow , when they are doing everything they can to bring down the elected Government of El Salvador . Thank you . The guerrilla attacks are directed from a headquarters in Managua , the capital of Nicaragua . But let us be clear as to the American attitude toward the Government of Nicaragua . We do not seek its overthrow . Our interest is to ensure that it does not infect its neighbors through the export of subversion and violence . Our purpose , in conformity with American and international law , is to prevent the flow of arms to El Salvador , Honduras , Guatemala , and Costa Rica . We have attempted to have a dialog with the Government of Nicaragua , but it persists in its efforts to spread violence . We should not , and we will not , protect the Nicaraguan Government from the anger of its own people . But we should , through diplomacy , offer an alternative . And as Nicaragua ponders its options , we can and will with all the resources of diplomacy protect each country of Central America from the danger of war . Even Costa Rica , Central America s oldest and strongest democracy a government so peaceful it does not even have an army is the object of bullying and threats from Nicaragua s dictators . Nicaragua s neighbors know that Sandinista promises of peace , nonalliance , and nonintervention have not been kept . Some 36 new military bases have been built . There were only 13 during the Somoza years . Nicaragua s new army numbers 25 , 000 men , supported by a militia of 50 , 000 . It is the largest army in Central America , supplemented by 2 , 000 Cuban military and security advisers . It is equipped with the most modern weapons dozens of Soviet made tanks , 800 Sovietbloc trucks , Soviet 152 millimeter howitzers , 100 anti aircraft guns , plus planes and helicopters . There are additional thousands of civilian advisers from Cuba , the Soviet Union , East Germany , Libya , and the PLAnd we are attacked because we have 55 military trainers in El Salvador . The goal of the professional guerrilla movements in Central America is as simple as it is sinister to destabilize the entire region from the Panama Canal to Mexico . And if you doubt beyond this point , just consider what Cayetano Carpio , the now deceased Salvadoran guerrilla leader , said earlier this month . Carpio said that after El Salvador falls , El Salvador and Nicaragua would be arm in arm and struggling for the total liberation of Central America . Nicaragua s dictatorial junta , who themselves made war and won power operating from bases in Honduras and Costa Rica , like to pretend that they are today being attacked by forces based in Honduras . The fact is , it is Nicaragua s government that threatens Honduras , not the reverse . It is Nicaragua who has moved heavy tanks close to the border , and Nicaragua who speaks of war . It was Nicaraguan radio that announced on April 8th the creation of a new , unified , revolutionary coordinating board to push forward the Marxist struggle in Honduras . Nicaragua , supported by weapons and military resources provided by the Communist bloc , represses its own people , refuses to make peace , and sponsors a guerrilla war against El Salvador . President Truman s words are as apt today as they were in 1947 when he , too , spoke before a joint session of the Congress At the present moment in world history , nearly every nation must choose between alternate ways of life . The choice is not too often a free one . One way of life is based upon the will of the majority and is distinguished by free institutions , representative government , free elections , guarantees of individual liberty , freedom of speech and religion , and freedom from political oppression . The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority . It relies upon terror and oppression , a controlled press and radio , fixed elections , and the suppression of personal freedoms . I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures . I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way . I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes . Collapse of free institutions and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for them but for the world . Discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples striving to maintain their freedom and independence . The countries of Central America are smaller than the nations that prompted President Truman s message . But the political and strategic stakes are the same . Will our response economic , social , military be as appropriate and successful as Truman s bold solutions to the problems of postwar Europe Some people have forgotten the successes of those years and the decades of peace , prosperity , and freedom they secured . Some people talk as though the United States were incapable of acting effectively in international affairs without risking war or damaging those we seek to help . Are democracies required to remain passive while threats to their security and prosperity accumulate Must we just accept the destabilization of an entire region from the Panama Canal to Mexico on our southern border Must we sit by while independent nations of this hemisphere are integrated into the most aggressive empire the modern world has seen Must we wait while Central Americans are driven from their homes like the more than a million who have sought refuge out of Afghanistan , or the 1 1 2 million who have fled Indochina , or the more than a million Cubans who have fled Castro s Caribbean utopia Must we , by default , leave the people of El Salvador no choice but to flee their homes , creating another tragic human exodus I do not believe there is a majority in the Congress or the country that counsels passivity , resignation , defeatism , in the face of this challenge to freedom and security in our own hemisphere . Thank you . Thank you . I do not believe that a majority of the Congress or the country is prepared to stand by passively while the people of Central America are delivered to totalitarianism and we ourselves are left vulnerable to new dangers . Only last week , an official of the Soviet Union reiterated Brezhnev s threat to station nuclear missiles in this hemisphere , 5 minutes from the United States . Like an echo , Nicaragua s Commandante Daniel Ortega confirmed that , if asked , his country would consider accepting those missiles . I understand that today they may be having second thoughts . Now , before I go any further , let me say to those who invoke the memory of Vietnam , there is no thought of sending American combat troops to Central America . They are not needed Thank you . And , as I say , they are not needed and , indeed , they have not been requested there . All our neighbors ask of us is assistance in training and arms to protect themselves while they build a better , freer life . We must continue to encourage peace among the nations of Central America . We must support the regional efforts now underway to promote solutions to regional problems . We cannot be certain that the Marxist Leninist bands who believe war is an instrument of politics will be readily discouraged . It is crucial that we not become discouraged before they do . Otherwise , the region s freedom will be lost and our security damaged in ways that can hardly be calculated . If Central America were to fall , what would the consequences be for our position in Asia , Europe , and for alliances such as NATIf the United States cannot respond to a threat near our own borders , why should Europeans or Asians believe that we are seriously concerned about threats to them If the Soviets can assume that nothing short of an actual attack on the United States will provoke an American response , which ally , which friend will trust us then The Congress shares both the power and the responsibility for our foreign policy . Tonight , I ask you , the Congress , to join me in a bold , generous approach to the problems of peace and poverty , democracy and dictatorship in the region . Join me in a program that prevents Communist victory in the short run , but goes beyond , to produce for the deprived people of the area the reality of present progress and the promise of more to come . Let us lay the foundation for a bipartisan approach to sustain the independence and freedom of the countries of Central America . We in the administration reach out to you in this spirit . We will pursue four basic goals in Central America First , in response to decades of inequity and indifference , we will support democracy , reform , and human freedom . This means using our assistance , our powers of persuasion , and our legitimate leverage to bolster humane democratic systems where they already exist and to help countries on their way to that goal complete the process as quickly as human institutions can be changed . Elections in El Salvador and also in Nicaragua must be open to all , fair and safe . The international community must help . We will work at human rights problems , not walk away from them . Second , in response to the challenge of world recession and , in the case of El Salvador , to the unrelenting campaign of economic sabotage by the guerrillas , we will support economic development . And by a margin of 2 to 1 our aid is economic now , not military . Seventy seven cents out of every dollar we will spend in the area this year goes for food , fertilizers , and other essentials for economic growth and development . And our economic program goes beyond traditional aid . The Caribbean Initiative introduced in the House earlier today will provide powerful trade and investment incentives to help these countries achieve self sustaining economic growth without exporting jobs . Our goal must be to focus our immense and growing technology to enhance health care , agriculture , industry , and to ensure that we who inhabit this interdependent region come to know and understand each other better , retaining our diverse identities , respecting our diverse traditions and institutions . And , third , in response to the military challenge from Cuba and Nicaragua to their deliberate use of force to spread tyranny we will support the security of the region s threatened nations . We do not view security assistance as an end in itself , but as a shield for democratization , economic development , and diplomacy . No amount of reform will bring peace so long as guerrillas believe they will win by force . No amount of economic help will suffice if guerrilla units can destroy roads and bridges and power stations and crops , again and again , with impunity . But with better training and material help , our neighbors can hold off the guerrillas and give democratic reform time to take root . And , fourth , we will support dialog and negotiations both among the countries of the region and within each country . The terms and conditions of participation in elections are negotiable . Costa Rica is a shining example of democracy . Honduras has made the move from military rule to democratic government . Guatemala is pledged to the same course . The United States will work toward a political solution in Central America which will serve the interests of the democratic process . To support these diplomatic goals , I offer these assurances The United States will support any agreement among Central American countries for the withdrawal , under fully verifiable and reciprocal conditions , of all foreign military and security advisers and troops . We want to help opposition groups join the political process in all countries and compete by ballots instead of bullets . We will support any verifiable , reciprocal agreement among Central American countries on the renunciation of support for insurgencies on neighbors territory . And , finally , we desire to help Central America end its costly arms race and will support any verifiable , reciprocal agreements on the nonimportation of offensive weapons . To move us toward these goals more rapidly , I am tonight announcing my intention to name an Ambassador at Large as my special envoy to Central America . He or she will report to me through the Secretary of State . The Ambassador s responsibilities will be to lend support to the efforts of regional governments to bring peace to this troubled area and to work closely with the Congress to assure the fullest possible , bipartisan coordination of our policies toward the region . What I am asking for is prompt congressional approval for the full reprogramming of funds for key current economic and security programs so that the people of Central America can hold the line against externally supported aggression . In addition , I am asking for prompt action on the supplemental request in these same areas to carry us through the current fiscal year and for early and favorable congressional action on my requests for fiscal year 1984 . And finally , I am asking that the bipartisan consensus , which last year acted on the trade and tax provisions of the Caribbean Basin Initiative in the House , again take the lead to move this vital proposal to the floor of both Chambers . And , as I said before , the greatest share of these requests is targeted toward economic and humanitarian aid , not military . What the administration is asking for on behalf of freedom in Central America is so small , so minimal , considering what is at stake . The total amount requested for aid to all of Central America in 1984 is about 600 million . That is less than one tenth of what Americans will spend this year on coin operated video games . In summation , I say to you that tonight there can be no question The national security of all the Americas is at stake in Central America . If we cannot defend ourselves there , we cannot expect to prevail elsewhere . Our credibility would collapse , our alliances would crumble , and the safety of our homeland would be put in jeopardy . We have a vital interest , a moral duty , and a solemn responsibility . This is not a partisan issue . It is a question of our meeting our moral responsibility to ourselves , our friends , and our posterity . It is a duty that falls on all of us the President , the Congress , and the people . We must perform it together . Who among us would wish to bear responsibility for failing to meet our shared obligation Thank you , God bless you , and good night .<speech_sep>We are here to mark that day in history when the Allied armies joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty . For 4 long years , much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow . Free nations had fallen , Jews cried out in the camps , millions cried out for liberation . Europe was enslaved , and the world prayed for its rescue . Here in Normandy the rescue began . Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history . We stand on a lonely , windswept point on the northern shore of France . The air is soft , but 40 years ago at this moment , the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men , and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon . At dawn , on the morning of the 6th of June , 1944 , 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs . Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns . The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance . The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machineguns and throwing grenades . And the American Rangers began to climb . They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up . When one Ranger fell , another would take his place . When one rope was cut , a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again . They climbed , shot back , and held their footing . Soon , one by one , the Rangers pulled themselves over the top , and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs , they began to seize back the continent of Europe . Two hundred and twenty five came here . After 2 days of fighting , only 90 could still bear arms . Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs . And before me are the men who put them there . These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc . These are the men who took the cliffs . These are the champions who helped free a continent . These are the heroes who helped end a war . Gentlemen , I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender s poem . You are men who in your lives fought for life . . . and left the vivid air signed with your honor . I think I know what you may be thinking right now thinking we were just part of a bigger effort everyone was brave that day . Well , everyone was . Do you remember the story of Bill Millin of the 51st Highlanders Forty years ago today , British troops were pinned down near a bridge , waiting desperately for help . Suddenly , they heard the sound of bagpipes , and some thought they were dreaming . Well , they were not . They looked up and saw Bill Millin with his bagpipes , leading the reinforcements and ignoring the smack of the bullets into the ground around him . Lord Lovat was with him Lord Lovat of Scotland , who calmly announced when he got to the bridge , Sorry I am a few minutes late , as if he had been delayed by a traffic jam , when in truth he had just come from the bloody fighting on Sword Beach , which he and his men had just taken . There was the impossible valor of the Poles who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold , and the unsurpassed courage of the Canadians who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast . They knew what awaited them there , but they would not be deterred . And once they hit Juno Beach , they never looked back . All of these men were part of a rollcall of honor with names that spoke of a pride as bright as the colors they bore the Royal Winnipeg Rifles , Poland s 24th Lancers , the Royal Scots Fusiliers , the Screaming Eagles , the Yeomen of England s armored divisions , the forces of Free France , the Coast Guard s Matchbox Fleet and you , the American Rangers . Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here . You were young the day you took these cliffs some of you were hardly more than boys , with the deepest joys of life before you . Yet , you risked everything here . Why Why did you do it What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs What inspired all the men of the armies that met here We look at you , and somehow we know the answer . It was faith and belief it was loyalty and love . The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right , faith that they fought for all humanity , faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next . It was the deep knowledge and pray God we have not lost it that there is a profound , moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest . You were here to liberate , not to conquer , and so you and those others did not doubt your cause . And you were right not to doubt . You all knew that some things are worth dying for . One s country is worth dying for , and democracy is worth dying for , because it is the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man . All of you loved liberty . All of you were willing to fight tyranny , and you knew the people of your countries were behind you . The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of the invasion was spreading through the darkness back home . They fought or felt in their hearts , though they could not know in fact , that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4 a . m . , in Kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying , and in Philadelphia they were ringing the Liberty Bell . Something else helped the men of D day their rockhard belief that Providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here that God was an ally in this great cause . And so , the night before the invasion , when Colonel Wolverton asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer he told them Do not bow your heads , but look up so you can see God and ask His blessing in what we are about to do . Also that night , General Matthew Ridgway on his cot , listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua I will not fail thee nor forsake thee . These are the things that impelled them these are the things that shaped the unity of the Allies . When the war was over , there were lives to be rebuilt and governments to be returned to the people . There were nations to be reborn . Above all , there was a new peace to be assured . These were huge and daunting tasks . But the Allies summoned strength from the faith , belief , loyalty , and love of those who fell here . They rebuilt a new Europe together . There was first a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies , all of whom had suffered so greatly . The United States did its part , creating the Marshall plan to help rebuild our allies and our former enemies . The Marshall plan led to the Atlantic alliance a great alliance that serves to this day as our shield for freedom , for prosperity , and for peace . In spite of our great efforts and successes , not all that followed the end of the war was happy or planned . Some liberated countries were lost . The great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time in the streets of Warsaw , Prague , and East Berlin . Soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came . They are still there , uninvited , unwanted , unyielding , almost 40 years after the war . Because of this , allied forces still stand on this continent . Today , as 40 years ago , our armies are here for only one purpose to protect and defend democracy . The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest . We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars It is better to be here ready to protect the peace , than to take blind shelter across the sea , rushing to respond only after freedom is lost . We have learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent . But we try always to be prepared for peace prepared to deter aggression prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms and , yes , prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation . In truth , there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union , so , together , we can lessen the risks of war , now and forever . It is fitting to remember here the great losses also suffered by the Russian people during World War I20 million perished , a terrible price that testifies to all the world the necessity of ending war . I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war . We want to wipe from the face of the Earth the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands . And I tell you , we are ready to seize that beachhead . We look for some sign from the Soviet Union that they are willing to move forward , that they share our desire and love for peace , and that they will give up the ways of conquest . There must be a changing there that will allow us to turn our hope into action . We will pray forever that some day that changing will come . But for now , particularly today , it is good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other , to our freedom , and to the alliance that protects it . We are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago , the same loyalties , traditions , and beliefs . We are bound by reality . The strength of America s allies is vital to the United States , and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe s democracies . We were with you then we are with you now . Your hopes are our hopes , and your destiny is our destiny . Here , in this place where the West held together , let us make a vow to our dead . Let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for . Let our actions say to them the words for which Matthew Ridgway listened I will not fail thee nor forsake thee . Strengthened by their courage , heartened by their value , and borne by their memory , let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died . Thank you very much , and God bless you all .<speech_sep>Thank you , Rector Logunov , and I want to thank all of you very much for a very warm welcome . It is a great pleasure to be here at Moscow State University , and I want to thank you all for turning out . I know you must be very busy this week , studying and taking your final examinations . So , let me just say zhelayu yam uspekha . Nancy could not make it today because she is visiting Leningrad , which she tells me is a very beautiful city , but she , too , says hello and wishes you all good luck . Let me say it is also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the Soviet Union . Before I left Washington , I received many heartfelt letters and telegrams asking me to carry here a simple message , perhaps , but also some of the most important business of this summit It is a message of peace and good will and hope for a growing friendship and closeness between our two peoples . As you know , I have come to Moscow to meet with one of your most distinguished graduates . In this , our fourth summit , General Secretary Gorbachev and I have spent many hours together , and I feel that we are getting to know each other well . Our discussions , of course , have been focused primarily on many of the important issues of the day , issues I want to touch on with you in a few moments . But first I want to take a little time to talk to you much as I would to any group of university students in the United States . I want to talk not just of the realities of today but of the possibilities of tomorrow . Standing here before a mural of your revolution , I want to talk about a very different revolution that is taking place right now , quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict . Its effects are peaceful , but they will fundamentally alter our world , shatter old assumptions , and reshape our lives . It is easy to underestimate because it is not accompanied by banners or fanfare . It is been called the technological or information revolution , and as its emblem , one might take the tiny silicon chip , no bigger than a fingerprint . One of these chips has more computing power than a roomful of old style computers . As part of an exchange program , we now have an exhibition touring your country that shows how information technology is transforming our lives replacing manual labor with robots , forecasting weather for farmers , or mapping the genetic code of DNA for medical researchers . These microcomputers today aid the design of everything from houses to ears to spacecraft they even design better and faster computers . They can translate English into Russian or enable the blind to read or help Michael Jackson produce on one synthesizer the sounds of a whole orchestra . Linked by a network of satellites and fiber optic cables , one individual with a desktop computer and a telephone commands resources unavailable to the largest governments just a few years ago . Like a chrysalis , we are emerging from the economy of the Industrial Revolution an economy confined to and limited by the Earth s physical resources into , as one economist titled his book , The Economy in Mind , in which there are no bounds on human imagination and the freedom to create is the most precious natural resource . Think of that little computer chip . Its value is not in the sand from which it is made but in the microscopic architecture designed into it by ingenious human minds . Or take the example of the satellite relaying this broadcast around the world , which replaces thousands of tons of copper mined from the Earth and molded into wire . In the new economy , human invention increasingly makes physical resources obsolete . We are breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny . Even as we explore the most advanced reaches of science , we are returning to the age old wisdom of our culture , a wisdom contained in the book of Genesis in the Bible In the beginning was the spirit , and it was from this spirit that the material abundance of creation issued forth . But progress is not foreordained . The key is freedom freedom of thought , freedom of information , freedom of communication . The renowned scientist , scholar , and founding father of this university , Mikhail Lomonosov , knew that . It is common knowledge , he said , that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid , particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy . You know , one of the first contacts between your country and mine took place between Russian and American explorers . The Americans were members of Cook s last voyage on an expedition searching for an Arctic passage on the island of Unalaska , they came upon the Russians , who took them in , and together with the native inhabitants , held a prayer service on the ice . The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs , men with vision , with the courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown . These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States . They are the prime movers of the technological revolution . In fact , one of the largest personal computer firms in the United States was started by two college students , no older than you , in the garage behind their home . Some people , even in my own country , look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste . What of all the entrepreneurs that fail Well , many do , particularly the successful ones often several times . And if you ask them the secret of their success , they will tell you it is all that they learned in their struggles along the way yes , it is what they learned from failing . Like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth , experience is the greatest teacher . And that is why it is so hard for government planners , no matter how sophisticated , to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true . The fact is , bureaucracies are a problem around the world . There is an old story about a town it could be anywhere with a bureaucrat who is known to be a good for nothing , but he somehow had always hung on to power . So one day , in a town meeting , an old woman got up and said to him There is a folk legend here where I come from that when a baby is born , an angel comes down from heaven and kisses it on one part of its body . If the angel kisses him on his hand , he becomes a handyman . If he kisses him on his forehead , he becomes bright and clever . And I have been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing . We are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the world . Places such as the Republic of Korea , Singapore , Taiwan have vaulted into the technological era , barely pausing in the industrial age along the way . Low tax agricultural policies in the subcontinent mean that in some years India is now a net exporter of food . Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change that are blowing over the People s Republic of China , where one quarter of the world s population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom . At the same time , the growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age . In Latin America in the 1970s , only a third of the population lived under democratic government today over 90 percent does . In the Philippines , in the Republic of Korea , free , contested , democratic elections are the order of the day . Throughout the world , free markets are the model for growth . Democracy is the standard by which governments are measured . We Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom . In fact , it is something of a national pastime . Every four years the American people choose a new President , and 1988 is one of those years . At one point there were 13 major candidates running in the two major parties , not to mention all the others , including the Socialist and Libertarian candidates all trying to get my job . About 1 , 000 local television stations , 8 , 500 radio stations , and 1 , 700 daily newspapers each one an independent , private enterprise , fiercely independent of the Government report on the candidates , grill them in interviews , and bring them together for debates . In the end , the people vote they decide who will be the next President . But freedom does not begin or end with elections . Go to any American town , to take just an example , and you will see dozens of churches , representing many different beliefs in many places , synagogues and mosques and you will see families of every conceivable nationality worshiping together . Go into any schoolroom , and there you will see children being taught the Declaration of Independence , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights among them life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness that no government can justly deny the guarantees in their Constitution for freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , and freedom of religion . Go into any courtroom , and there will preside an independent judge , beholden to no government power . There every defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers , usually 12 men and women common citizens they are the ones , the only ones , who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence . In that court , the accused is innocent until proven guilty , and the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused . Go to any university campus , and there you will find an open , sometimes heated discussion of the problems in American society and what can be done to correct them . Turn on the television , and you will see the legislature conducting the business of government right there before the camera , debating and voting on the legislation that will become the law of the land . March in any demonstration , and there are many of them the people s right of assembly is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the police . Go into any union hall , where the members know their right to strike is protected by law . As a matter of fact , one of the many jobs I had before this one was being president of a union , the Screen Actors Guild . I led my union out on strike , and I am proud to say we won . But freedom is more even than this . Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things . It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace . It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions . It is the right to put forth an idea , scoffed at by the experts , and watch it catch fire among the people . It is the right to dream to follow your dream or stick to your conscience , even if you are the only one in a sea of doubters . Freedom is the recognition that no single person , no single authority or government has a monopoly on the truth , but that every individual life is infinitely precious , that every one of us put on this world has been put there for a reason and has something to offer . America is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities . Our ties to you are more than ones of good feeling they are ties of kinship . In America , you will find Russians , Armenians , Ukrainians , peoples from Eastern Europe and Central Asia . They come from every part of this vast continent , from every continent , to live in harmony , seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected , each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the richness it brings to our lives . Recently , a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the West . We can only hope that it will not be long before all are allowed to do so and Ukrainian Americans , Baltic Americans , Armenian Americans can freely visit their homelands , just as this Irish American visits his . Freedom , it has been said , makes people selfish and materialistic , but Americans are one of the most religious peoples on Earth . Because they know that liberty , just as life itself , is not earned but a gift from God , they seek to share that gift with the world . Reason and experience , said George Washington in his farewell address , both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle . And it is substantially true , that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government . Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to keep government limited , unintrusive a system of constraints on power to keep politics and government secondary to the important things in life , the true sources of value found only in family and faith . But I hope you know I go on about these things not simply to extol the virtues of my own country but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of your land . Who , after all , needs to tell the land of Dostoyevsky about the quest for truth , the home of Kandinsky and Scriabin about imagination , the rich and noble culture of the Uzbek man of letters Alisher Navoi about beauty and heart The great culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all humanity . Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom . It comes , not from the literature of America , but from this country , from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century , Boris Pasternak , in the novel Zhivago . He writes I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down by threats any kind of threat , whether of jail or of retribution after death then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion tamer in the circus with his whip , not the prophet who sacrificed himself . But this is just the point what has for centuries raised man above the beast is not the cudgel , but an inward music the irresistible power of unarmed truth . The irresistible power of unarmed truth . Today the world looks expectantly to signs of change , steps toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union . We watch and we hope as we see positive changes taking place . There are some , I know , in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity , who fear to embrace the hope of the future sometimes it takes faith . It is like that scene in the cowboy movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , which some here in Moscow recently had a chance to see . The posse is closing in on the two outlaws , Butch and Sundance , who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff , with a sheer drop of hundreds of feet to the raging rapids below . Butch turns to Sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below , but Sundance refuses . He says he had rather fight it out with the posse , even though they are hopelessly outnumbered . Butch says that is suicide and urges him to jump , but Sundance still refuses and finally admits , I cannot swim . Butch breaks up laughing and says , You crazy fool , the fall will probably kill you . And , by the way , both Butch and Sundance made it , in case you did not see the movie . I think what I have just been talking about is perestroika and what its goals are . But change would not mean rejection of the past . Like a tree growing strong through the seasons , rooted in the Earth and drawing life from the sun , so , too , positive change must be rooted in traditional values in the land , in culture , in family and community and it must take its life from the eternal things , from the source of all life , which is faith . Such change will lead to new understandings , new opportunities , to a broader future in which the tradition is not supplanted but finds its full flowering . That is the future beckoning to your generation . At the same time , we should remember that reform that is not institutionalized will always be insecure . Such freedom will always be looking over its shoulder . A bird on a tether , no matter how long the rope , can always be pulled back . And that is why , in my conversation with General Secretary Gorbachev , I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change to put guarantees on reform . And we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world the Berlin Wall . It is time to remove the barriers that keep people apart . I am proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries . General Secretary Gorbachev mentioned on Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times . Gorbachev and I first began working on this in 1985 . In our discussion today , we agreed on working up to several thousand exchanges a year from each country in the near future . But not everyone can travel across the continents and oceans . Words travel lighter , and that is why we had like to make available to this country more of our 11 , 000 magazines and periodicals and our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in seconds . Nothing would please us more than for the Soviet people to get to know us better and to understand our way of life . Just a few years ago , few would have imagined the progress our two nations have made together . The INF treaty , which General Secretary Gorbachev and I signed last December in Washington and whose instruments of ratification we will exchange tomorrow the first true nuclear arms reduction treaty in history , calling for the elimination of an entire class of and Soviet nuclear missiles . And just 16 days ago , we saw the beginning of your withdrawal from Afghanistan , which gives us hope that soon the fighting may end and the healing may begin and that that suffering country may find self determination , unity , and peace at long last . It is my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these issues will be carried on to address the continuing destruction and conflicts in many regions of the globe and that the serious discussions that led to the Geneva accords on Afghanistan will help lead to solutions in southern Africa , Ethiopia , Cambodia , the Persian Gulf , and Central America . I have often said Nations do not distrust each other because they are armed they are armed because they distrust each other . If this globe is to live in peace and prosper , if it is to embrace all the possibilities of the technological revolution , then nations must renounce , once and for all , the right to an expansionist foreign policy . Peace between nations must be an enduring goal , not a tactical stage in a continuing conflict . I have been told that there is a popular song in your country perhaps you know it whose evocative refrain asks the question , Do the Russians want a war In answer it says Go ask that silence lingering in the air , above the birch and poplar there beneath those trees the soldiers lie . Go ask my mother , ask my wife then you will have to ask no more , Do the Russians want a war But what of your one time allies What of those who embraced you on the Elbe What if we were to ask the watery graves of the Pacific or the European battlefields where America s fallen were buried far from home What if we were to ask their mothers , sisters , and sons , do Americans want war Ask us , too , and you will find the same answer , the same longing in every heart . People do not make wars governments do . And no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain , for economic advantage , for ideology . A people free to choose will always choose peace . Americans seek always to make friends of old antagonists . After a colonial revolution with Britain , we have cemented for all ages the ties of kinship between our nations . After a terrible Civil War between North and South , we healed our wounds and found true unity as a nation . We fought two world wars in my lifetime against Germany and one with Japan , but now the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan are two of our closest allies and friends . Some people point to the trade disputes between us as a sign of strain , but they are the frictions of all families , and the family of free nations is a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one . I can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in my lifetime to see American and Soviet diplomats grappling with the problem of trade disputes between America and a growing , exuberant , exporting Soviet Union that had opened up to economic freedom and growth . And as important as these official people to people exchanges are , nothing would please me more than for them to become unnecessary , to see travel between East and West become so routine that university students in the Soviet Union could take a month off in the summer and , just like students in the West do now , put packs on their backs and travel from country to country in Europe with barely a passport cheek in between . Nothing would please me more than to see the day that a concert promoter in , say , England could call up a Soviet rock group , without going through any government agency , and have them playing in Liverpool the next night . Is this just a dream Perhaps , but it is a dream that is our responsibility to have come true . Your generation is living in one of the most exciting , hopeful times in Soviet history . It is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope , when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free . I am reminded of the famous passage near the end of Gogol s Dead Souls . Comparing his nation to a speeding troika , Gogol asks what will be its destination . But he writes , There was no answer save the bell pouring forth marvelous sound . We do not know what the conclusion will be of this journey , but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled . In this Moscow spring , this May 1988 , we may be allowed that hope that freedom , like the fresh green sapling planted over Tolstoy s grave , will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture . We may be allowed to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through , ringing through , leading to a new world of reconciliation , friendship , and peace . Thank you all very much , and da blagoslovit vas gospod God bless you . Logunov Dear friends , President has kindly agreed to answer your questions . But since he does not have too much time , only 15 minutes so , those who have questions , please ask them . Strategic Arms Reductions And this is a student from the history faculty , and he says that he is happy to welcome you on behalf of the students of the university . And the first question is that the improvement in the relations between the two countries has come about during your tenure as President , and in this regard he would like to ask the following question . It is very important to get a handle on the question of arms control and , specifically , the limitation of strategic arms . Do you think that it will be possible for you and the General Secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic arms during the time that you are still President President Reagan Well , the arms treaty that is being negotiated now is the so called START treaty , and it is based on taking the intercontinental ballistic missiles and reducing them by half , down to parity between our two countries . Now , this is a much more complicated treaty than the INF treaty , the intermediate range treaty , which we have signed and which our two governments have ratified and is now in effect . So , there are many things still to be settled . You and we have had negotiators in Geneva for months working on various points of this treaty . Once we had hoped that maybe , like the INF treaty , we would have been able to sign it here at this summit meeting . It is not completed there are still some points that are being debated . We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office , which is in the coming January , but I assure you that if it is not I assure you that I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it is signed . My dream has always been that once we have started down this road , we can look forward to a day you can look forward to a day when there will be no more nuclear weapons in the world at all . Young People The question is The universities influence public opinion , and the student wonders how the youths have changed since the days when you were a student up until now President Reagan Well , wait a minute . How you have changed since the era of my own youth How just students have changed , the youth have changed . You were a student . At your time there were one type . How they have changed President Reagan Well , I know there was a period in our country when there was a very great change for the worse . When I was Governor of California , I could start a riot just by going to a campus . But that has all changed , and I could be looking out at an American student body as well as I am looking out here and would not be able to tell the difference between you . I think that back in our day I did happen to go to school , get my college education in a unique time it was the time of the Great Depression , when , in a country like our own , there was 25 percent unemployment and the bottom seemed to have fallen out of everything . But we had I think what maybe I should be telling you from my point here , because I graduated in 1932 , that I should tell you that when you get to be my age , you are going to be surprised how much you recall the feelings you had in these days here and that how easy it is to understand the young people because of your own having been young once . You know an awful lot more about being young than you do about being old . And I think there is a seriousness , I think there is a sense of responsibility that young people have , and I think that there is an awareness on the part of most of you about what you want your adulthood to be and what the country you live in you want it to be . And I have a great deal of faith . I said the other day to 76 students they were half American and half Russian . They had held a conference here and in Finland and then in the United States , and I faced them just the other day , and I had to say I could not tell the difference looking at them , which were which , but I said one line to them . I said I believe that if all the young people of the world today could get to know each other , there would never be another war . And I think that of you . I think that of the other students that I have addressed in other places . And of course , I know also that you are young and , therefore , there are certain things that at times take precedence . I will illustrate one myself . Twenty five years after I graduated , my alma mater brought me back to the school and gave me an honorary degree . And I had to tell them they compounded a sense of guilt I had nursed for 25 years because I always felt the first degree they gave me was honorary . You are great Carry on . Regional Conflicts President , you have just mentioned that you welcome the efforts settlement of the Afghanistan question and the difference of other regional conflicts . What conflicts do you mean Central America conflicts , Southeast Asian , or South African President Reagan Well , for example , in South Africa , where Namibia has been promised its independence as a nation another new African nation . But it is impossible because of a civil war going on in another country there , and that civil war is being fought on one side by some 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 Cuban troops who have gone from the Americas over there and are fighting on one side with one kind of authoritative government . When that country was freed from being a colony and given its independence , one faction seized power and made itself the government of that nation . And leaders of another seeming the majority of the people had wanted , simply , the people to have the right to choose the government that they wanted , and that is the civil war that is going on . But what we believe is that those foreign soldiers should get out and let them settle it , let the citizens of that nation settle their problems . And the same is true in Nicaragua . Nicaragua has been Nicaragua made a promise . They had a dictator . There was a revolution , there was an organization that and was aided by others in the revolution , and they appealed to the Organization of American States for help in getting the dictator to step down and stop the killing . And he did . But the Organization of American States had asked , what are the goals of the revolution And they were given in writing , and they were the goals of pluralistic society , of the right of unions and freedom of speech and press and so forth and free elections a pluralistic society . And then the one group that was the best organized among the revolutionaries seized power , exiled many of the other leaders , and has its own government , which violated every one of the promises that had been made . And here again , we want we are trying to encourage the getting back those or making those promises come true and letting the people of that particular country decide their fate . Soviet MIAs in Afghanistan Esteemed President , I am very much anxious and concerned about the destiny of 310 Soviet soldiers being missing in Afghanistan . Are you willing to help in their search and their return to the motherland President Reagan Very much so . We would like nothing better than that . Constitution The reservation of the inalienable rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution faces certain problems for example , the right of people to have arms , or for example , the problem appears , an evil appears whether spread of pornography or narcotics is compatible with these rights . Do you believe that these problems are just unavoidable problems connected with democracy , or they could be avoided President Reagan Well , if I understand you correctly , this is a question about the inalienable rights of the people does that include the right to do criminal acts for example , in the use of drugs and so forth No . No , we have a set of laws . I think what is significant and different about our system is that every country has a constitution , and most constitutions or practically all of the constitutions in the world are documents in which the government tells the people what the people can do . Our Constitution is different , and the difference is in three words it almost escapes everyone . The three words are , We the people . Our Constitution is a document in which we the people tell the government what its powers are . And it can have no powers other than those listed in that document . But very carefully , at the same time , the people give the government the power with regard to those things which they think would be destructive to society , to the family , to the individual and so forth infringements on their rights . And thus , the government can enforce the laws . But that has all been dictated by the people . President s Retirement Plans President , from history I know that people who have been connected with great power , with big posts , say goodbye , leave these posts with great difficulty . Since your term of office is coming to an end , what sentiments do you experience and whether you feel like , if , hypothetically , you can just stay for another term President Reagan Well , I will tell you something . I think it was a kind of revenge against Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who was elected four times the only President . There had kind of grown a tradition in our country about two terms . That tradition was started by Washington , our first President , only because there was great talk at the formation of our country that we might become a monarchy , and we had just freed ourselves from a monarchy . So , when the second term was over , George Washington stepped down and said he would do it stepping down so that there would not get to be the kind of idea of an inherited aristocracy . Well , succeeding Presidents many of them did not get a chance at a second term they did one term and were gone . But that tradition kind of remained , but it was just a tradition . And then Roosevelt ran the four times died very early in his fourth term . And suddenly , in the atmosphere at that time , they added an amendment to the Constitution that Presidents could only serve two terms . When I get out of office I cannot do this while I am in office , because it will look as I am selfishly doing it for myself when I get out of office , I am going to travel around what I call the mashed potato circuit that is the after dinner speaking and the speaking to luncheon groups and so forth I am going to travel around and try to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out that amendment to the Constitution because it was an interference with the democratic rights of the people . The people should be allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for , for as many times as they want to vote for him and that it is they who are being denied a right . But you see , I will no longer be President then , so I can do that and talk for that . There are a few other things I am going to try to convince the people to impress upon our Congress , the things that should be done . I have always described it that if in Hollywood , when I was there , if you did not sing or dance , you wound up as an afterdinner speaker . And I did not sing or dance . So , I have a hunch that I will be out on the speaking circuit , telling about a few things that I did not get done in government , but urging the people to tell the Congress they wanted them done . American Indians President , I have heard that a group of American Indians have come here because they could not meet you in the United States of America . If you fail to meet them here , will you be able to correct it and to meet them back in the United States President Reagan I did not know that they had asked to see me . If they have come here or whether to see them there I had be very happy to see them . Let me tell you just a little something about the American Indian in our land . We have provided millions of acres of land for what are called preservations or reservations , I should say . They , from the beginning , announced that they wanted to maintain their way of life , as they had always lived there in the desert and the plains and so forth . And we set up these reservations so they could , and have a Bureau of Indian Affairs to help take care of them . At the same time , we provide education for them schools on the reservations . And they are free also to leave the reservations and be American citizens among the rest of us , and many do . Some still prefer , however , that way that early way of life . And we have done everything we can to meet their demands as to how they want to live . Maybe we made a mistake . Maybe we should not have humored them in that wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle . Maybe we should have said , no , come join us be citizens along with the rest of us . As I say , many have many have been very successful . And I am very pleased to meet with them , talk with them at any time and see what their grievances are or what they feel they might be . And you had be surprised Some of them became very wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil , and you can get very rich pumping oil . And so , I do not know what their complaint might be . Soviet Dissidents Well , that is one I do not know about , or maybe the information has not been all given out on that . But you have to understand that Americans come from every corner of the world . I received a letter from a man that called something to my attention recently . He said , you can go to live in France , but you cannot become a Frenchman you can go to live in Germany , you cannot become a German or a Turk , or a Greek , or whatever . But he said anyone , from any corner of the world , can come to live in America and become an American . You have to realize that we are a people that are made up of every strain , nationality , and race of the world . And the result is that when people in our country think someone is being mistreated or treated unjustly in another country , these are people who still feel that kinship to that country because that is their heritage . In America , whenever you meet someone new and become friends , one of the first things you tell each other is what your bloodline is . For example , when I am asked , I have to say Irish , English , and Scotch English and Scotch on my mother s side , Irish on my father s side . But all of them have that . Well , when you take on to yourself a wife , you do not stop loving your mother . So , Americans all feel a kind of a kinship to that country that their parents or their grandparents or even some great grandparents came from you do not lose that contact . So , what I have come and what I have brought to the General Secretary and I must say he has been very cooperative about it I have brought lists of names that have been brought to me from people that are relatives or friends that know that or that believe that this individual is being mistreated here in this country , and they want him to be allowed to emigrate to our country some are separated families . One that I met in this , the other day , was born the same time I was . He was born of Russian parents who had moved to America , oh , way back in the early 1900s , and he was born in 1911 . And then sometime later , the family moved back to Russia . Now he is grown , has a son . He is an American citizen . But they wanted to go back to America and being denied on the grounds that , well , they can go back to America , but his son married a Russian young lady , and they want to keep her from going back . Well , the whole family said , no , we are not going to leave her alone here . She is a member of the family now . Well , that kind of a case is brought to me personally , so I bring it to the General Secretary . And as I say , I must say , he has been most helpful and most agreeable about correcting these things . Now , I am not blaming you I am blaming bureaucracy . We have the same type of thing happen in our own country . And every once in a while , somebody has to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake it loose and say , Stop doing what you are doing And this is the type of thing and the names that we have brought . And it is a list of names , all of which have been brought to me personally by either relatives or close friends and associates . Thank you very much . You are all very kind . I thank you very much . And I hope I answered the questions correctly . Nobody asked me what it was going to feel like to not be President anymore . I have some understanding , because after I had been Governor for eight years and then stepped down , I want to tell you what it is like . We had only been home a few days , and someone invited us out to dinner . Nancy and I both went out , got in the back seat of the car , and waited for somebody to get in front and drive us . That is beautiful . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>
