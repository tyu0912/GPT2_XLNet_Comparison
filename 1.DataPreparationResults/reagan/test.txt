Chairman , Vice President , delegates to this convention , and fellow citizens In 75 days , I hope we enjoy a victory that is the size of the heart of Texas . Nancy and I extend our deep thanks to the Lone Star State and the Big the city of Dallas for all their warmth and hospitality . Four years ago I did not know precisely every duty of this office , and not too long ago , I learned about some new ones from the first graders of Corpus Christi School in Chambersburg , Pennsylvania . Little Leah Kline was asked by her teacher to describe my duties . She said The President goes to meetings . He helps the animals . The President gets frustrated . He talks to other Presidents . How does wisdom begin at such an early age Tonight , with a full heart and deep gratitude for your trust , I accept your nomination for the Presidency of the United States . I will campaign on behalf of the principles of our party which lift America confidently into the future . America is presented with the clearest political choice of half a century . The distinction between our two parties and the different philosophy of our political opponents are at the heart of this campaign and America s future . I have been campaigning long enough to know that a political party and its leadership cannot change their colors in four days . We will not , and no matter how hard they tried , our opponents did not in San Francisco . We did not discover our values in a poll taken a week before the convention . And we did not set a weathervane on top of the Golden Gate Bridge before we started talking about the American family . The choices this year are not just between two different personalities or between two political parties . They are between two different visions of the future , two fundamentally different ways of governing their government of pessimism , fear , and limits , or ours of hope , confidence , and growth . Their government sees people only as members of groups ours serves all the people of America as individuals . Theirs lives in the past , seeking to apply the old and failed policies to an era that has passed them by . Ours learns from the past and strives to change by boldly charting a new course for the future . Theirs lives by promises , the bigger , the better . We offer proven , workable answers . Our opponents began this campaign hoping that America has a poor memory . Well , let us take them on a little stroll down memory lane . Let us remind them of how a 4 . 8 percent inflation rate in 1976 became back to back years of double digit inflation the worst since World War I punishing the poor and the elderly , young couples striving to start their new lives , and working people struggling to make ends meet . Inflation was not some plague borne on the wind it was a deliberate part of their official economic policy , needed , they said , to maintain prosperity . They did not tell us that with it would come the highest interest rates since the Civil War . As average monthly mortgage payments more than doubled , home building nearly ground to a halt tens of thousands of carpenters and others were thrown out of work . And who controlled both Houses of the Congress and the executive branch at that time Not us , not us . Campaigning across America in 1980 , we saw evidence everywhere of industrial decline . And in rural America , farmers costs were driven up by inflation . They were devastated by a wrongheaded grain embargo and were forced to borrow money at exorbitant interest rates just to get by . And many of them did not get by . Farmers have to fight insects , weather , and the marketplace they should not have to fight their own government . The high interest rates of 1980 were not talked about in San Francisco . But how about taxes They were talked about in San Francisco . Will Rogers once said he never met a man he did not like . Well , if I could paraphrase Will , our friends in the other party have never met a tax they did not like or hike . Under their policies , tax rates have gone up three times as much for families with children as they have for everyone else over these past three decades . In just the five years before we came into office , taxes roughly doubled . Some who spoke so loudly in San Francisco of fairness were among those who brought about the biggest single , individual tax increase in our history in 1977 , calling for a series of increases in the Social Security payroll tax and in the amount of pay subject to that tax . The bill they passed called for two additional increases between now and 1990 , increases that bear down hardest on those at the lower income levels . The Census Bureau confirms that , because of the tax laws we inherited , the number of households at or below the poverty level paying federal income tax more than doubled between 1980 and 1982 . Well , they received some relief in 1983 , when our across the board tax cut was fully in place . And they will get more help when indexing goes into effect this January . Our opponents have repeatedly advocated eliminating indexing . Would that really hurt the rich No , because the rich are already in the top brackets . But those working men and women who depend on a cost of living adjustment just to keep abreast of inflation would find themselves pushed into higher tax brackets and would not even be able to keep even with inflation because they had be paying a higher income tax . That is bracket creep and our opponents are for it , and we are against it . It is up to us to see that all our fellow citizens understand that confiscatory taxes , costly social experiments , and economic tinkering were not just the policies of a single administration . For the 26 years prior to January of 1981 , the opposition party controlled both Houses of Congress . Every spending bill and every tax for more than a quarter of a century has been of their doing . About a decade ago , they said federal spending was out of control , so they passed a budget control act and , in the next five years , ran up deficits of 260 billion . Some control . In 1981 we gained control of the Senate and the executive branch . With the help of some concerned Democrats in the House we started a policy of tightening the federal budget instead of the family budget . A task force chaired by Vice President George Bush the finest Vice President this country has ever had it eliminated unnecessary regulations that had been strangling business and industry . And while we have our friends down memory lane , maybe they had like to recall a gimmick they designed for their 1976 campaign . As President Ford told us the night before last , adding the unemployment and inflation rates , they got what they called a misery index . In 76 it came to 12 1 2 percent . They declared the incumbent had no right to seek reelection with that kind of a misery index . Well , four years ago , in the 1980 election , they did not mention the misery index , possibly because it was then over 20 percent . And do you know something They will not mention it in this election either . It is down to 11 . 6 and dropping . By nearly every measure , the position of poor Americans worsened under the leadership of our opponents . Teenage drug use , out of wedlock births , and crime increased dramatically . Urban neighborhoods and schools deteriorated . Those whom government intended to help discovered a cycle of dependency that could not be broken . Government became a drug , providing temporary relief , but addiction as well . And let us get some facts on the table that our opponents do not want to hear . The biggest annual increase in poverty took place between 1978 and 1981 over 9 percent each year , in the first two years of our administration . Well , I should pardon me I did not put a period in there . In the first two years of our administration , that annual increase fell to 5 . 3 percent . And 1983 was the first year since 1978 that there was no appreciable increase in poverty at all . Pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into programs in order to make people worse off was irrational and unfair . It was time we ended this reliance on the government process and renewed our faith in the human process . In 1980 the people decided with us that the economic crisis was not caused by the fact that they lived too well . Government lived too well . It was time for tax increases to be an act of last resort , not of first resort . The people told the liberal leadership in Washington , Try shrinking the size of government before you shrink the size of our paychecks . Our government was also in serious trouble abroad . We had aircraft that could not fly and ships that could not leave port . Many of our military were on food stamps because of meager earnings , and reenlistments were down . Ammunition was low , and spare parts were in short supply . Many of our allies mistrusted us . In the four years before we took office , country after country fell under the Soviet yoke . Since January 20 , 1981 , not 1 inch of soil has fallen to the Communists . All right . But worst of all , Americans were losing the confidence and optimism about the future that has made us unique in the world . Parents were beginning to doubt that their children would have the better life that has been the dream of every American generation . We can all be proud that pessimism is ended . America is coming back and is more confident than ever about the future . Tonight , we thank the citizens of the United States whose faith and unwillingness to give up on themselves or this country saved us all . Together , we began the task of controlling the size and activities of the government by reducing the growth of its spending while passing a tax program to provide incentives to increase productivity for both workers and industry . Today , a working family earning 25 , 000 has about 2 , 900 more in purchasing power than if tax and inflation rates were still at the 1980 level . Today , of all the major industrial nations of the world , America has the strongest economic growth one of the lowest inflation rates the fastest rate of job creation six and a half million jobs in the last year and a half a record 600 , 000 business incorporations in 1983 and the largest increase in real , after tax personal income since World War IWe are enjoying the highest level of business investment in history , and America has renewed its leadership in developing the vast new opportunities in science and high technology . America is on the move again and expanding toward new eras of opportunity for everyone . Now , we are accused of having a secret . Well , if we have , it is that we are going to keep the mighty engine of this nation revved up . And that means a future of sustained economic growth without inflation that is going to create for our children and grandchildren a prosperity that finally will last . Today our troops have newer and better equipment their morale is higher . The better armed they are , the less likely it is they will have to use that equipment . But if , heaven forbid , they are ever called upon to defend this nation , nothing would be more immoral than asking them to do so with weapons inferior to those of any possible opponent . We have also begun to repair our valuable alliances , especially our historic NATO alliance . Extensive discussions in Asia have enabled us to start a new round of diplomatic progress there . In the Middle East , it remains difficult to bring an end to historic conflicts , but we are not discouraged . And we shall always maintain our pledge never to sell out one of our closest friends , the State of Israel . Closer to home , there remains a struggle for survival for free Latin American States , allies of ours . They valiantly struggle to prevent Communist takeovers fueled massively by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Our policy is simple We are not going to betray our friends , reward the enemies of freedom , or permit fear and retreat to become American policies especially in this hemisphere . None of the four wars in my lifetime came about because we were too strong . It is weakness that invites adventurous adversaries to make mistaken judgments . America is the most peaceful , least warlike nation in modern history . We are not the cause of all the ills of the world . We are a patient and generous people . But for the sake of our freedom and that of others , we cannot permit our reserve to be confused with a lack of resolve . Ten months ago , we displayed this resolve in a mission to rescue American students on the imprisoned island of Grenada . Democratic candidates have suggested that this could be likened to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the crushing of human rights in Poland or the genocide in Cambodia . Could you imagine Harry Truman , John Kennedy , Hubert Humphrey , or Scoop Jackson making such a shocking comparison Nineteen of our fine young men lost their lives on Grenada , and to even remotely compare their sacrifice to the murderous actions taking place in Afghanistan is unconscionable . There are some obvious and important differences . First , we were invited in by six East Caribbean States . Does anyone seriously believe the people of Eastern Europe or Afghanistan invited the Russians Second , there are hundreds of thousands of Soviets occupying captive nations across the world . Today , our combat troops have come home . Our students are safe , and freedom is what we left behind in Grenada . There are some who have forgotten why we have a military . It is not to promote war it is to be prepared for peace . There is a sign over the entrance to Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington State , and that sign says it all Peace is our profession . Our next administration All right . I heard you . And that administration will be committed to completing the unfinished agenda that we have placed before the Congress and the nation . It is an agenda which calls upon the national Democratic leadership to cease its obstructionist ways . We have heard a lot about deficits this year from those on the other side of the aisle . Well , they should be experts on budget deficits . They have spent most of their political careers creating deficits . For 42 of the last 50 years , they have controlled both Houses of the Congress . And for almost all of those 50 years , deficit spending has been their deliberate policy . Now , however , they call for an end to deficits . They call them ours . Yet , at the same time , the leadership of their party resists our every effort to bring federal spending under control . For three years straight , they have prevented us from adopting a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution . We will continue to fight for that amendment , mandating that government spend no more than government takes in . And we will fight , as the Vice President told you , for the right of a President to veto items in appropriations bills without having to veto the entire bill . There is no better way than the line item veto , now used by Governors in 43 states to cut out waste in government . I know . As Governor of California , I successfully made such vetos over 900 times . Now , their candidate , it would appear , has only recently found deficits alarming . Nearly 10 years ago he insisted that a 52 billion deficit should be allowed to get much bigger in order to lower unemployment , and he said that sometimes we need a deficit in order to stimulate the economy . As a Senator , he voted to override President Ford s veto of billions of dollars in spending bills and then voted no on a proposal to cut the 1976 deficit in half . Was anyone surprised by his pledge to raise your taxes next year if given the chance In the Senate , he voted time and again for new taxes , including a 10 percent income tax surcharge , higher taxes on certain consumer items . He also voted against cutting the excise tax on automobiles . And he was part and parcel of that biggest single , individual tax increase in history the Social Security payroll tax of 1977 . It tripled the maximum tax and still did not make the system solvent . If our opponents were as vigorous in supporting our voluntary prayer amendment as they are in raising taxes , maybe we could get the Lord back in the schoolrooms and drugs and violence out . Something else illustrates the nature of the choice Americans must make . While we have been hearing a lot of tough talk on crime from our opponents , the House Democratic leadership continues to block a critical anticrime bill that passed the Republican Senate by a 91 to 1 vote . Their burial of this bill means that you and your families will have to wait for even safer homes and streets . There is no longer any good reason to hold back passage of tuition tax credit legislation . Millions of average parents pay their full share of taxes to support public schools while choosing to send their children to parochial or other independent schools . Does not fairness dictate that they should have some help in carrying a double burden When we talk of the plight of our cities , what would help more than our enterprise zones bill , which provides tax incentives for private industry to help rebuild and restore decayed areas in 75 sites all across America If they really wanted a future of boundless new opportunities for our citizens , why have they buried enterprise zones over the years in committee Our opponents are openly committed to increasing our tax burden . We are committed to stopping them , and we will . They call their policy the new realism , but their new realism is just the old liberalism . They will place higher and higher taxes on small businesses , on family farms , and on other working families so that government may once again grow at the people s expense . You know , we could say they spend money like drunken sailors , but that would be unfair to drunken sailors All right . I agree . I was going to say , it would be unfair , because the sailors are spending their own money . Our tax policies are and will remain prowork , progrowth , and profamily . We intend to simplify the entire tax system to make taxes more fair , easier to understand , and , most important , to bring the tax rates of every American further down , not up . Now , if we bring them down far enough , growth will continue strong the underground economy will shrink the world will beat a path to our door and no one will be able to hold America back and the future will be ours . All right . Another part of our future , the greatest challenge of all , is to reduce the risk of nuclear war by reducing the levels of nuclear arms . I have addressed parliaments , have spoken to parliaments in Europe and Asia during these last three and a half years , declaring that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought . And those words , in those assemblies , were greeted with spontaneous applause . There are only two nations who by their agreement can rid the world of those doomsday weapons the United States of America and the Soviet Union . For the sake of our children and the safety of this Earth , we ask the Soviets who have walked out of our negotiations to join us in reducing and , yes , ridding the Earth of this awful threat . When we leave this hall tonight , we begin to place those clear choices before our fellow citizens . We must not let them be confused by those who still think that GNP stands for gross national promises . But after the debates , the position papers , the speeches , the conventions , the television commercials , primaries , caucuses , and slogans after all this , is there really any doubt at all about what will happen if we let them win this November Is there any doubt that they will raise our taxes That they will send inflation into orbit again That they will make government bigger then ever And deficits even worse Raise unemployment Cut back our defense preparedness Raise interest rates Make unilaterial and unwise concessions to the Soviet Union And they will do all that in the name of compassion . It is what they have done to America in the past . But if we do our job right , they will not be able to do it again . It is getting late . All right . In 1980 we asked the people of America , Are you better off than you were four years ago Well , the people answered then by choosing us to bring about a change . We have every reason now , four years later , to ask that same question again , for we have made a change . The American people joined us and helped us . Let us ask for their help again to renew the mandate of 1980 , to move us further forward on the road we presently travel , the road of common sense , of people in control of their own destiny the road leading to prosperity and economic expansion in a world at peace . As we ask for their help , we should also answer the central question of public service Why are we here What do we believe in Well for one thing , we are here to see that government continues to serve the people and not the other way around . Yes , government should do all that is necessary , but only that which is necessary . We do not lump people by groups or special interests . And let me add , in the party of Lincoln , there is no room for intolerance and not even a small corner for anti Semitism or bigotry of any kind . Many people are welcome in our house , but not the bigots . We believe in the uniqueness of each individual . We believe in the sacredness of human life . For some time now we have all fallen into a pattern of describing our choice as left or right . It is become standard rhetoric in discussions of political philosophy . But is that really an accurate description of the choice before us Go back a few years to the origin of the terms and see where left or right would take us if we continued far enough in either direction . Stalin . Hitler . One would take us to Communist totalitarianism the other to the totalitarianism of Hitler . Is not our choice really not one of left or right , but of up or down Down through the welfare state to statism , to more and more government largesse accompanied always by more government authority , less individual liberty and , ultimately , totalitarianism , always advanced as for our own good . The alternative is the dream conceived by our Founding Fathers , up to the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society . We do not celebrate dependence day on the Fourth of July . We celebrate Independence Day . We celebrate the right of each individual to be recognized as unique , possessed of dignity and the sacred right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . At the same time , with our independence goes a generosity of spirit more evident here than in almost any other part of the world . Recognizing the equality of all men and women , we are willing and able to lift the weak , cradle those who hurt , and nurture the bonds that tie us together as one nation under God . Finally , we are here to shield our liberties , not just for now or for a few years but forever . Could I share a personal thought with you tonight , because tonight s kind of special to me . It is the last time , of course , that I will address you under these same circumstances . I hope you will invite me back to future conventions . Nancy and I will be forever grateful for the honor you have done us , for the opportunity to serve , and for your friendship and trust . I began political life as a Democrat , casting my first vote in 1932 for Franklin Delano Roosevelt . That year , the Democrats called for a 25 percent reduction in the cost of government by abolishing useless commissions and offices and consolidating departments and bureaus , and giving more authority to state governments . As the years went by and those promises were forgotten , did I leave the Democratic Party , or did the leadership of that party leave not just me but millions of patriotic Democrats who believed in the principles and philosophy of that platform One of the first to declare this was a former Democratic nominee for President Al Smith , the Happy Warrior , who went before the nation in 1936 to say , on television or on radio that he could no longer follow his party s leadership and that he was taking a walk . As Democratic leaders have taken their party further and further away from its first principles , it is no surprise that so many responsible Democrats feel that our platform is closer to their views , and we welcome them to our side . Four years ago we raised a banner of bold colors no pale pastels . We proclaimed a dream of an America that would be a shining city on a hill . We promised that we had reduce the growth of the federal government , and we have . We said we intended to reduce interest rates and inflation , and we have . We said we would reduce taxes to provide incentives for individuals and business to get our economy moving again , and we have . We said there must be jobs with a future for our people , not government make work programs , and , in the last 19 months , as I have said , six ad a half million new jobs in the private sector have been created . We said we would once again be respected throughout the world , and we are . We said we would restore our ability to protect our freedom on land , sea , and in the air , and we have . We bring to the American citizens in this election year a record of accomplishment and the promise of continuation . We came together in a national crusade to make America great again , and to make a new beginning . Well , now it is all coming together . With our beloved nation at peace , we are in the midst of a springtime of hope for America . Greatness lies ahead of us . Holding the Olympic games here in the United States began defining the promise of this season . All through the spring and summer , we marveled at the journey of the Olympic torch as it made its passage east to west . Over 9 , 000 miles , by some 4 , 000 runners , that flame crossed a portrait of our nation . From our Gotham City , New York , to the Cradle of Liberty , Boston , across the Appalachian springtime , to the City of the Big Shoulders , Chicago . Moving south toward Atlanta , over to Louis , past its Gateway Arch , across wheatfields into the stark beauty of the Southwest and then up into the still , snowcapped Rockies . And , after circling the greening Northwest , it came down to California , across the Golden Gate and finally into Los Angeles . And all along the way , that torch became a celebration of America . And we all became participants in the celebration . Each new story was typical of this land of ours . There was Ansel Stubbs , a youngster of 99 , who passed the torch in Kansas to 4 year old Katie Johnson . In Pineville , Kentucky , it came at 1 a . m . , so hundreds of people lined the streets with candles . At Tupelo , Mississippi , at 7 a . m . on a Sunday morning , a robed church choir sang God Bless America as the torch went by . That torch went through the Cumberland Gap , past the Martin Luther King , , Memorial , down the Santa Fe Trail , and alongside Billy the Kid s grave . In Richardson , Texas , it was carried by a 14 year old boy in a special wheelchair . In West Virginia the runner came across a line of deaf children and let each one pass the torch for a few feet , and at the end these youngsters hands talked excitedly in their sign language . Crowds spontaneously began singing America the Beautiful or The Battle Hymn of the Republic . And then , in San Francisco a Vietnamese immigrant , his little son held on his shoulders , dodged photographers and policemen to cheer a 19 year old black man pushing an 88 year old white woman in a wheelchair as she carried the torch . My friends , that is America . We cheered in Los Angeles as the flame was carried in and the giant Olympic torch burst into a billowing fire in front of the teams , the youth of 140 nations assembled on the floor of the Coliseum . And in that moment , maybe you were struck as I was with the uniqueness of what was taking place before a hundred thousand people in the stadium , most of them citizens of our country , and over a billion worldwide watching on television . There were athletes representing 140 countries here to compete in the one country in all the world whose people carry the bloodlines of all those 140 countries and more . Only in the United States is there such a rich mixture of races , creeds , and nationalities only in our melting pot . And that brings to mind another torch , the one that greeted so many of our parents and grandparents . Just this past Fourth of July , the torch atop the Statue of Liberty was hoisted down for replacement . We can be forgiven for thinking that maybe it was just worn out from lighting the way to freedom for 17 million new Americans . So , now we will put up a new one . The poet called Miss Liberty s torch the lamp beside the golden door . Well , that was the entrance to America , and it still is . And now you really know why we are here tonight . The glistening hope of that lamp is still ours . Every promise , every opportunity is still golden in this land . And through that golden door our children can walk into tomorrow with the knowledge that no one can be denied the promise that is America . Her heart is full her door is still golden , her future bright . She has arms big enough to comfort and strong enough to support , for the strength in her arms is the strength of her people . She will carry on in the 80s unafraid , unashamed , and unsurpassed . In this springtime of hope , some lights seem eternal America s is . Thank you , God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>The New Republic magazine and Henry Trewhitt , diplomatic correspondent for the Baltimore Sun . Edwin Newman , formerly of NBC News and now a syndicated columnist for King Features , is our moderator . Ed . No , but I am glad you asked that question , because I know it is on many peoples minds . I have ordered an investigation . I know that the CIA is already going forward with one . We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIadvising supposedly on military tactics the contras . And he drew up this manual . It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed . And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there , the man in charge , and he sent it on up here to CIwhere more pages were excised before it was printed . But some way or other , there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CINow , those are the details as we have them . And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed , we certainly are going to do something about that . We will take the proper action at the proper time . I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there , and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mondale in complete agreement with what we are doing , because the plan that he has outlined is the one we have been following for quite some time , including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group . So , I can only tell you about the manual that we are not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt . But if guilt is established , whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then , and they will be removed . I am afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua . There is not someone there directing all of this activity . There are , as you know , CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and , certainly , in Central America . And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to , and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order , in December of 1981 , that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations . Yes . I have so many things there to respond to , I am going to pick out something you said earlier . You have been all over the country repeating something that , I will admit , the press has also been repeating that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back . I never , ever conceived of such a thing . I never said any such thing . In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations , I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional type weapons , not as destabilizing as the land based missiles , and that they were also weapons that or carriers that if they were sent out and there was a change , you could call them back before they had launched their missiles . But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing , which is absolutely false . How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile , I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been . So , thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record . I am sure that you appreciate that . I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union . I retract nothing that I have said . I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have . But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world , we have to live with each other . And I told Gromyko we do not like their system . They do not like ours . And we are not going to change their system , and they sure better not try to change ours . But between us , we can either destroy the world or we can save it . And I suggested that , certainly , it was to their common interest , along with ours , to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons . And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding . I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic . I know that Mondale , in the past , has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves , and if we were kind and good and did something nice , they would respond accordingly . And the result was unilateral disarmament . We canceled the B 1 under the previous administration . What did we get for it Nothing . The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament , of weakness , if you will . And now we are putting up a defense of our own . And I have made it very plain to them , we seek no superiority . We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us . Now , they claim they are not . And I made it plain to them , we are not . There is been no change in my attitude at all . I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union . And we did get their attention . Ah , well , now you have added a hypothetical there at the end , Kalb , about where we would send troops in to fight . I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be , but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us . One is the Middle East , and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations , because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there . Our neighbors here in America are vital to us . We are working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates , the thousands of them , from Angola . So , I can say there are a great many interests . I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin . That is where I think the future of the world lies . But I am not going to pick out one and , in advance , hypothetically say , Oh , yes , we would send troops there . I do not want to send troops any place . All right . Yes . I am not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here . But with regard to whether Mondale would be strong , as he said he would be , I know that he has a commercial out where he is appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F 14s take off . And that is an image of strength except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned , he would have been deep in the water out there because there would not have been any Nimitz to stand on he was against it . He was against the F 14 fighter , he was against the M 1 tank , he was against the BI bomber , he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military , he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe . And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none . Indeed , he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate . And he opposed even President Carter , when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget . I propose a budget I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation s strength , in real terms , by double that of the Soviet Union . I will tell you where we disagree . It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F 14 , and I will tell you why . The plane was not flying the way it was supposed to be it was a waste of money . Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department . My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar s worth of defense . There is a big difference between the two of us . A President must manage that budget . I will keep us strong , but you will not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need . You pay 500 for a 5 hammer , you are not buying strength . No , Morton , I do not agree to all of those things . First of all , when we and our allies the Italians , the French , and the United Kingdom went into Lebanon , we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government . But the first pardon me the first time we went in , we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists . Israel could not be blamed for that . Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently , and Israel chased them all the way to there . Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove , and did remove , more than 13 , 000 of those terrorists from Lebanon . We departed . And then the government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders . And we were succeeding . We were there for the better part of a year . Our position happened to be at the airport . Oh , there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire , but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission . I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them , they can darn well shoot back . And this is what we did . We never initiated any kind of action we defended ourselves there . But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese government had been organized if you will remember , there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan . We were succeeding , and that was why the terrorist acts began . There are forces there and that includes Syria , in my mind who do not want us to succeed , who do not want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon , dominant over its own territory . And so , the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building . Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in . But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them . And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission . Morton , no . I think there is a great difference between the government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel , and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on . In the terrorist situation , there are terrorist factions all over . In a recent 30 day period , 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed . The most recent has been the one in Brighton . In dealing with terrorists , yes , we want to retaliate , but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating . I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal , along with our allies , with this terrorist problem . And it is going to take all the nations together , just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago . Well , the red light went on . I could have gone on forever . Yes . First of all , Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks . That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there . That is one . On the other things that you have just said about the terrorists , I am tempted to ask you what you would do . These are unidentified people , and after the bomb goes off , they are blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they are going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it . We are going to , as I say , we are busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from , and retaliation will be taken . But we are not going to simply kill some people to say , Oh , look , we got even . We want to know when we retaliate that we are retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts . And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice . Not at all , Trewhitt , and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign . I am not going to exploit , for political purposes , my opponent s youth and inexperience . If I still have time , I might add , Trewhitt , I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero , I do not know which , that said , If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young , there would be no state . Yes , this had to do with our disarmament talks . And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons , the most destabilizing are the land based . You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later . So , we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those . And then we made it plain , a second phase , take up the submarine launched or the airborne missiles . The Soviet Union , to our surprise and not just mine made it plain when we brought this up that they placed , they thought , a greater reliance on the landbased missiles and , therefore , they wanted to take up all three . And we agreed . We said , All right , if that is what you want to do . But it was a surprise to us , because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had . So , why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on landbased But even after we gave in and said , All right , let us discuss it all , they walked away from the table . We did not . Deadly Gambits , concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us , both in terms of security and terms of arms control . That is why they call the President the Commander in Chief . Good intentions , I grant . But it takes more than that . You must be tough and smart . Yes . I know it will come as a surprise to Mondale , but I am in charge . And , as a matter of fact , we have not avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union . Very early in my administration I proposed and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration I proposed a total elimination of intermediate range missiles , where the Soviets had better than a 10 and still have better than a 10 to 1 advantage over the allies in Europe . When they protested that and suggested a smaller number , perhaps , I went along with that . The so called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union , and it was not me that turned it down , the Soviet Union disavowed it . Deadly Gambits . The other is John Neuhaus , who is one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country . Both said that this administration turned down the walk in the woods agreement first , and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security . When Nitze , a good negotiator , returned , he was rebuked , and his boss was fired . This is the kind of leadership that we have had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times . Now we have a runaway arms race . All they have got to show for four years in S . Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration , and nothing before . They are tough negotiators , but all previous Presidents have made progress . This one has not . Georgie Anne , we , believe me , supported the Simpson Mazzoli bill strongly and the bill that came out of the Senate . However , there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill as a matter of fact , made it a bad bill . And in conference we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee . There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill . I cannot go into detail about them here . But it is true our borders are out of control . It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations . And I supported this bill . I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally . With regard to the employer sanctions , we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens , but also , while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers , there is another employer that we should not be so concerned about , and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country , and the individuals cannot complain because of their illegal status . We do not think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free . And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions , and so forth and I am going to do everything I can , and all of us in the administration are , to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us , once again , control of our borders . And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there , yes , no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends . But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment , they are going to seek that employment across our borders . And we work with those other countries . No . As a matter of fact , the population explosion , if you look at the actual figures , has been vastly exaggerated over exaggerated . As a matter of fact , there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have . It is almost like going back to the Malthusian theory , when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then . But the problem of population growth is one , here , with regard to our immigration . And we have been the safety valve , whether we wanted to or not , with the illegal entry here , in Mexico , where their population is increasing and they do not have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs . And this is what we are trying to work out , not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem . Well , my rebuttal is I have heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things , but not for illegal immigration across our border and it has nothing to do with it . But with regard to these high interest rates , too , at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office , Mondale , they were 21 1 2 the prime rate . It is now 12 1 4 , and I predict it will be coming down a little more shortly . So , we are trying to undo some of the things that your administration did . Kalb , I think what has been hailed as something I am supposedly , as President , discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things and that is the prophecies down through the years , the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon , and so forth , and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true , that the prophecies are coming together that portend that . But no one knows whether Armageddon , those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow . So , I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon . Now , with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war , of course we would . But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world , in Europe and in Asia , I have made a statement to each one of them , and I will repeat it here A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought . And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage . But the deterrent and that is what it is for is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept , but propose that we research to see if there is not a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles . And if such a defense could be found , would not it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people Why not What if we did and I hope we can we are still researching what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive , a counter weapon . But suppose we came up with that Now , some people have said , Ah , that would make war imminent , because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy . But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do Say , Look , here s what we can do . We will even give it to you . Now , will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid , all of us , of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon . Yes , my rebuttal , once again , is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union no , Mondale , my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say , Now , are you willing to join us Here s what we give them a demonstration and then say Here s what we can do . Now , if you are willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world , then we will give you this one , so that we would both know that no one can cheat that we are both got something that if anyone tries to cheat . . . . But when you keep Star Warring it I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind I am not a scientist . I said , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me , that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon . And suddenly somebody says , Oh , it is got to be up there , and it is Star Wars , and so forth . I do not know what it would be , but if we can come up with one , I think the world will be better off . If they are antisatellite weapons , I assume they are going to be aimed against satellites . Now , this is the most dangerous technology that we possess . The Soviets try to spy on us , steal this stuff . And to give them technology of this kind , I disagree with . You have not just accepted research , President . You have set up a Strategic Defense Initiative , an agency , you are beginning to test , you are talking about deploying , you are asking for a budget of some 30 billion for this purpose . This is an arms escalation . And we will be better off , far better off , if we stop right now , because we have more to lose in space then they do . If someday , somebody comes along with an answer , that is something else . But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable . Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure That is what a President s for . Well , as I say , we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow . And there is every evidence , every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States . And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific . Well , the invasion of Afghanistan did not take place on our watch . I have described what has happened in Iran , and we were not here then either . I do not think that our record of human rights can be assailed . I think that we have observed , ourselves , and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world . Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy . And I was glad to hear him say that , because that is what we have been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this . Human rights are not advanced when , at the same time , you then stand back and say , Whoops , we did not know the gun was loaded , and you have another totalitarian power on your hands . Well , I cannot say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff , but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal , my ultimate dream , and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world . And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct , or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done . I am not going to roll over , as Mondale suggests , and give them something that could turn around and be used against us . But I think it is a very interesting proposal , to see if we can find , first of all , something that renders those weapons obsolete , incapable of their mission . But Mondale seems to approve MAD MAD is mutual assured destruction meaning , if you use nuclear weapons on us , the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we will kill as many people of yours as you will kill of ours . I think that to do everything we can to find , as I say , something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights . Yes . My thanks to the League of Women Voters , to the panelists , the moderator , and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting . I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for an economic recovery that has become expansion , freedom and , most of all , we are at peace . I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and , one day , to eliminate them entirely . The question before you comes down to this Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last four years Or do we want to go forward , marching together , as a nation of strength and that is going to continue to be strong We should not be dwelling on the past , or even the present . The meaning of this election is the future and whether we are going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need . Several years ago , I was given an assignment to write a letter . It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened . I remember driving down the California coast one day . My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them . But I could not completely neglect the beauty around me the Pacific out there on one side of the highway , shining in the sunlight , the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side . And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway , and if they would see the same thing . And with that thought , I realized what a job I had with that letter . I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us . We know nothing about them . They would know all about our problems . They would know how we solved them , and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them . They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons , nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power , aimed at each other , capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it . And then I thought to myself , what are they going to say about us , what are those people 100 years from now going to think They will know whether we used those weapons or not . Well , what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny . Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day , down in history 100 years or perhaps before , someone will say , Thank God for those people back in the 1980s for preserving our freedom , for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth , with all its grandeur and its beauty . You know , I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these four years , and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted four years ago . George Bush , who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country , and we have had , in these last few months , a wonderful experience . We have met young America . We have met your sons and daughters . All right . I was just going to I know . I know , yes .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . Chancellor Kohl , Governing Mayor Diepgen , ladies and gentlemen Twenty four years ago , President John Kennedy visited Berlin , speaking to the people of this city and the world at the city hall . Well , since then two other presidents have come , each in his turn , to Berlin . And today myself , make my second visit to your city . We come to Berlin , we American Presidents , because it is our duty to speak , in this place , of freedom . But I must confess , we are drawn here by other things as well by the feeling of history in this city , more than 500 years older than our own nation by the beauty of the Grunewald and the Tiergarten most of all , by your courage and determination . Perhaps the composer , Paul Lincke , understood something about American Presidents . You see , like so many Presidents before me , I come here today because wherever I go , whatever I do Ich hab noch einen koffer in Berlin . Our gathering today is being broadcast throughout Western Europe and North America . I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the East . To those listening throughout Eastern Europe , I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the American people . To those listening in East Berlin , a special word Although I cannot be with you , I address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before me . For I join you , as I join your fellow countrymen in the West , in this firm , this unalterable belief Es gibt nur ein Berlin . Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city , part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe . From the Baltic , south , those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire , concrete , dog runs , and guardtowers . Farther south , there may be no visible , no obvious wall . But there remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same still a restriction on the right to travel , still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women the will of a totalitarian state . Yet it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most clearly here , cutting across your city , where the news photo and the television screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the world . Standing before the Brandenburg Gate , every man is a German , separated from his fellow men . Every man is a Berliner , forced to look upon a scar . President von Weizsacker has said The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed . Today I say As long as this gate is closed , as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand , it is not the German question alone that remains open , but the question of freedom for all mankind . Yet I do not come here to lament . For I find in Berlin a message of hope , even in the shadow of this wall , a message of triumph . In this season of spring in 1945 , the people of Berlin emerged from their air raid shelters to find devastation . Thousands of miles away , the people of the United States reached out to help . And in 1947 Secretary of State as you have been told George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the Marshall Plan . Speaking precisely 40 years ago this month , he said Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine , but against hunger , poverty , desperation , and chaos . In the Reichstag a few moments ago , I saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan . I was struck by the sign on a burnt out , gutted structure that was being rebuilt . I understand that Berliners of my own generation can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the Western sectors of the city . The sign read simply The Marshall Plan is helping here to strengthen the free world . A strong , free world in the West , that dream became real . Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant . Italy , France , Belgium virtually every nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth the European Community was founded . In West Germany and here in Berlin , there took place an economic miracle , the Wirtschaftswunder . Adenauer , Erhard , Reuter , and other leaders understood the practical importance of liberty that just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech , so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessman enjoy economic freedom . The German leaders reduced tariffs , expanded free trade , lowered taxes . From 1950 to 1960 alone , the standard of living in West Germany and Berlin doubled . Where four decades ago there was rubble , today in West Berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city in Germany busy office blocks , fine homes and apartments , proud avenues , and the spreading lawns of park land . Where a city s culture seemed to have been destroyed , today there are two great universities , orchestras and an opera , countless theaters , and museums . Where there was want , today there is abundance food , clothing , automobiles the wonderful goods of the Ku damm . From devastation , from utter ruin , you Berliners have , in freedom , rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on Earth . The Soviets may have had other plans . But , my friends , there were a few things the Soviets did not count on Berliner herz , Berliner humor , ja , und Berliner schnauze . In the 1950s , Khrushchev predicted We will bury you . But in the West today , we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well being unprecedented in all human history . In the Communist world , we see failure , technological backwardness , declining standards of health , even want of the most basic kind too little food . Even today , the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself . After these four decades , then , there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion Freedom leads to prosperity . Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace . Freedom is the victor . And now the Soviets themselves may , in a limited way , be coming to understand the importance of freedom . We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness . Some political prisoners have been released . Certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed . Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control . Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state Or are they token gestures , intended to raise false hopes in the West , or to strengthen the Soviet system without changing it We welcome change and openness for we believe that freedom and security go together , that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace . There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable , that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace . General Secretary Gorbachev , if you seek peace , if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , if you seek liberalization Come here to this gate Gorbachev , open this gate Gorbachev , tear down this wall I understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent and I pledge to you my country s efforts to help overcome these burdens . To be sure , we in the West must resist Soviet expansion . So we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength . Yet we seek peace so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides . Beginning 10 years ago , the Soviets challenged the Western alliance with a grave new threat , hundreds of new and more deadly SS 20 nuclear missiles , capable of striking every capital in Europe . The Western alliance responded by committing itself to a counterdeployment unless the Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution namely , the elimination of such weapons on both sides . For many months , the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness . As the alliance , in turn , prepared to go forward with its counterdeployment , there were difficult days days of protests like those during my 1982 visit to this city and the Soviets later walked away from the table . But through it all , the alliance held firm . And I invite those who protested then I invite those who protest today to mark this fact Because we remained strong , the Soviets came back to the table . And because we remained strong , today we have within reach the possibility , not merely of limiting the growth of arms , but of eliminating , for the first time , an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth . As I speak , NATO ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons . At the talks in Geneva , we have also proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons . And the Western allies have likewise made far reaching proposals to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapons . While we pursue these arms reductions , I pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to deter Soviet aggression at any level at which it might occur . And in cooperation with many of our allies , the United States is pursuing the Strategic Defense Initiative research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation , but on defenses that truly defend on systems , in short , that will not target populations , but shield them . By these means we seek to increase the safety of Europe and all the world . But we must remember a crucial fact East and West do not mistrust each other because we are armed we are armed because we mistrust each other . And our differences are not about weapons but about liberty . When President Kennedy spoke at the City Hall those 24 years ago , freedom was encircled , Berlin was under siege . And today , despite all the pressures upon this city , Berlin stands secure in its liberty . And freedom itself is transforming the globe . In the Philippines , in South and Central America , democracy has been given a rebirth . Throughout the Pacific , free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth . In the industrialized nations , a technological revolution is taking place a revolution marked by rapid , dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications . In Europe , only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom . Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth , of information and innovation , the Soviet Union faces a choice It must make fundamental changes , or it will become obsolete . Today thus represents a moment of hope . We in the West stand ready to cooperate with the East to promote true openness , to break down barriers that separate people , to create a safer , freer world . And surely there is no better place than Berlin , the meeting place of East and West , to make a start . Free people of Berlin Today , as in the past , the United States stands for the strict observance and full implementation of all parts of the Four Power Agreement of 1971 . Let us use this occasion , the 750th anniversary of this city , to usher in a new era , to seek a still fuller , richer life for the Berlin of the future . Together , let us maintain and develop the ties between the Federal Republic and the Western sectors of Berlin , which is permitted by the 1971 agreement . And I invite Gorbachev Let us work to bring the Eastern and Western parts of the city closer together , so that all the inhabitants of all Berlin can enjoy the benefits that come with life in one of the great cities of the world . To open Berlin still further to all Europe , East and West , let us expand the vital air access to this city , finding ways of making commercial air service to Berlin more convenient , more comfortable , and more economical . We look to the day when West Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe . With our French and British partners , the United States is prepared to help bring international meetings to Berlin . It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of United Nations meetings , or world conferences on human rights and arms control or other issues that call for international cooperation . There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds , and we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges , cultural events , and other programs for young Berliners from the East . Our French and British friends , I am certain , will do the same . And it is my hope that an authority can be found in East Berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the Western sectors . One final proposal , one close to my heart Sport represents a source of enjoyment and ennoblement , and you many have noted that the Republic of Korea South Korea has offered to permit certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place in the North . International sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city . And what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year to hold the Olympic games here in Berlin , East and West In these four decades , as I have said , you Berliners have built a great city . You have done so in spite of threats the Soviet attempts to impose the East mark , the blockade . Today the city thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall . What keeps you here Certainly there is a great deal to be said for your fortitude , for your defiant courage . But I believe there is something deeper , something that involves Berlin s whole look and feel and way of life not mere sentiment . No one could live long in Berlin without being completely disabused of illusions . Something instead , that has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them , that continues to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surrounding totalitarian presence that refuses to release human energies or aspirations . Something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation , that says yes to this city , yes to the future , yes to freedom . In a word , I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is love love both profound and abiding . Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter , to the most fundamental distinction of all between East and West . The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit , thwarting the human impulse to create , to enjoy , to worship . The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront . Years ago , before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches , they erected a secular structure the television tower at Alexander Platz . Virtually ever since , the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower s one major flaw , treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind . Yet even today when the sun strikes that sphere that sphere that towers over all Berlin the light makes the sign of the cross . There in Berlin , like the city itself , symbols of love , symbols of worship , cannot be suppressed . As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag , that embodiment of German unity , I noticed words crudely spray painted upon the wall , perhaps by a young Berliner , This wall will fall . Beliefs become reality . Yes , across Europe , this wall will fall . For it cannot withstand faith it cannot withstand truth . The wall cannot withstand freedom . And I would like , before I close , to say one word . I have read , and I have been questioned since I have been here about certain demonstrations against my coming . And I would like to say just one thing , and to those who demonstrate so . I wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek , no one would ever be able to do what they are doing again . Thank you and God bless you all .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . In the business that I formerly was in , I would have to say this is a very difficult spot to be introduced to you who have waited so patiently following this wonderful talent that we have seen here . And I should have gone on first , and then you should have followed to close the show . But thank you very much . Nancy and I are most grateful to be with you here today , and I will take a chance and say , muintir na hEireann . Did I get it right All right . Well , it is difficult to express my appreciation to all of you . I feel like I am about to drown everyone in a bath of nostalgia . Of all the honors and gifts that have been afforded me as President , this visit is the one that I will cherish dearly . You see , I did not know much about my family background not because of a lack of interest , but because my father was orphaned before he was 6 years old . And now thanks to you and the efforts of good people who have dug into the history of a poor immigrant family , I know at last whence I came . And this has given my soul a new contentment . And it is a joyous feeling . It is like coming home after a long journey . You see , my father , having been orphaned so young , he knew nothing of his roots also . And , God rest his soul , I told the Father , I think he is here , too , today , and very pleased and happy to know that this is whence he came . Robert Frost , a renowned American poet , once said , Home is the place where , when you have to go there , they have to take you in . Well , it is been so long since my great grandfather set out that you do not have to take me in . So , I am certainly thankful for this wonderful homecoming today . I cannot think of a place on the planet I would rather claim as my roots more than Ballyporeen , County Tipperary . My great grandfather left here in a time of stress , seeking to better himself and his family . From what I am told , we were a poor family . But my ancestors took with them a treasure , an indomitable spirit that was cultivated in the rich soil of this county . And today I come back to you as a descendant of people who are buried here in paupers graves . Perhaps this is God s way of reminding us that we must always treat every individual , no matter what his or her station in life , with dignity and respect . And who knows Someday that person s child or grandchild might grow up to become the Prime Minister of Ireland or President of the United States . Looking around town today , I was struck by the similarity between Ballyporeen and the small town in Illinois where I was born , Tampico . Of course , there is one thing you have that we did not have in Tampico . We did not have a Ronald Reagan Lounge in town . Well , the spirit is the same , this spirit of warmth , friendliness , and openness in Tampico and Ballyporeen , and you make me feel very much at home . What unites us is our shared heritage and the common values of our two peoples . So many Irish men and women from every walk of life played a role in creating the dream of America . One was Charles Thompson , Secretary of the Continental Congress , and who designed the first Great Seal of the United States . I am certainly proud to be part of that great Irish American tradition . From the time of our revolution when Irishmen filled the ranks of the Continental Army , to the building of the railroads , to the cultural contributions of individuals like the magnificent tenor John McCormack and the athletic achievements of the great heavyweight boxing champion John Sullivan all of them are part of a great legacy . Speaking of sports , I had like to take this opportunity to congratulate an organization of which all Irish men and women can be proud , an organization that this year is celebrating its 100th anniversary the Gaelic Athletic Association . I understand it was formed a hundred years ago in Tipperary to foster the culture and games of traditional Ireland . Some of you may be aware that I began my career as a sports announcer a sports broadcaster , so I had an early appreciation for sporting competition . Well , congratulations to all of you during this GAA centennial celebration . I also understand that not too far from here is the home of the great Irish novelist Charles Joseph Kickham . The Irish identity flourished in the United States . Irish men and women proud of their heritage can be found in every walk of life . I even have some of them in my Cabinet . One of them traces his maternal roots to Mitchellstown , just down the road from Ballyporeen . And he and I have almost the same name . I am talking about Secretary of the Treasury Don Regan . He spells it R e g a n . We are all of the same clan , we are all cousins . I tried to tell the Secretary one day that his branch of the family spelled it that way because they just could not handle as many letters as ours could . And then I received a paper from Ireland that told me that the clan to which we belong , that in it those who said Regan and spelled it that way were the professional people and the educators , and only the common laborers called it Reagan . So , meet a common laborer . The first job I ever got I was 14 years old , and they put a pick and a shovel in my hand and my father told me that that was fitting and becoming to one of our name . The bond between our two countries runs deep and strong , and I am proud to be here in recognition and celebration of our ties that bind . My roots in Ballyporeen , County Tipperary , are little different than millions of other Americans who find their roots in towns and counties all over the Isle of Erin . I just feel exceptionally lucky to have this chance to visit you . Last year a member of my staff came through town and recorded some messages from you . It was quite a tape , and I was moved deeply by the sentiments that you expressed . One of your townsmen sang me a bit of a tune about Scan Tracy , and a few lines stuck in my mind . They went like this not that I will sing And I will never more roam , from my own native home , in Tipperary so far away . Well , the Reagans roamed to America , but now we are back . And Nancy and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for coming out to welcome us , for the warmth of your welcome . God bless you all . In the business that I formerly was in , I would have to say this is a very difficult spot to be introduced to you who have waited so patiently following this wonderful talent that we have seen here .

And Nancy and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for coming out to welcome us , for the warmth of your welcome . God bless you all .<speech_sep>Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you and good evening . The sponsor has been identified , but unlike most television programs , the performer has not been provided with a script . As a matter of fact , I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks . I have spent most of my life as a Democrat . I recently have seen fit to follow another course . I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines . Now , one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity . The line has been used , We have never had it so good . But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity is not something on which we can base our hopes for the future . No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income . Today , 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector s share , and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in . We have not balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years . We have raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months , and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world . We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury we do not own an ounce . Foreign dollar claims are 27 . 3 billion dollars . And we have just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value . As for the peace that we would preserve , I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely . Do they mean peace , or do they mean we just want to be left in peace There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us . We are at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars , and it is been said if we lose that war , and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours , history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening . Well I think it is time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers . Not too long ago , two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban refugee , a businessman who had escaped from Castro , and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said , We do not know how lucky we are . And the Cuban stopped and said , How lucky you are I had someplace to escape to . And in that sentence he told us the entire story . If we lose freedom here , there is no place to escape to . This is the last stand on earth . And this idea that government is beholden to the people , that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people , is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man srelation to man . This is the issue of this election Whether we believe in our capacity for self government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves . You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right . Well I had like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right . There is only an up or down man s old old aged dream , the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order , or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism . And regardless of their sincerity , their humanitarian motives , those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course . In this vote harvesting time , they use terms like the Great Society , or as we were told a few days ago by the President , we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people . But they have been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print . These are not Republican accusations . For example , they have voices that say , The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism . Another voice says , The profit motive has become outmoded . It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state . Or , Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century . Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded . He referred to the President as our moral teacher and our leader , and he says he is hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document . He must be freed , so that he can do for us what he knows is best . And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania , another articulate spokesman , defines liberalism as meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government . Well , for one , resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me , the free men and women of this country , as the masses . This is a term we have not applied to ourselves in America . But beyond that , the full power of centralized government this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize . They knew that governments do not control things . A government cannot control the economy without controlling people . And they know when a government sets out to do that , it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose . They also knew , those Founding Fathers , that outside of its legitimate functions , government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy . Now , we have no better example of this than government s involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years . Since 1955 , the cost of this program has nearly doubled . One fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus . Three fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21 percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce . You see , that one fourth of farming that is regulated and controlled by the federal government . In the last three years we have spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we do not grow . Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater , as President , would seek to eliminate farmers . He should do his homework a little better , because he will find out that we have had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs . He will also find that the Democratic administration has sought to get from Congress extension of the farm program to include that three fourths that is now free . He will find that they have also asked for the right to imprison farmers who would not keep books as prescribed by the federal government . The Secretary of Agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals . And contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil . At the same time , there is been an increase in the Department of Agriculture employees . There is now one for every 30 farms in the United States , and still they cannot tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austria disappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estes never left shore . Every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy , but how who are farmers to know what is best for them The wheat farmers voted against a wheat program . The government passed it anyway . Now the price of bread goes up the price of wheat to the farmer goes down . Meanwhile , back in the city , under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on . Private property rights so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be . In a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy , we see such spectacles as in Cleveland , Ohio , a million and a half dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a more compatible use of the land . The President tells us he is now going to start building public housing units in the thousands , where heretofore we have only built them in the hundreds . But FHand the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120 , 000 housing units they have taken back through mortgage foreclosure . For three decades , we have sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning , and the more the plans fail , the more the planners plan . The latest is the Area Redevelopment Agency . They have just declared Rice County , Kansas , a depressed area . Rice County , Kansas , has two hundred oil wells , and the 14 , 000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks . And when the government tells you you are depressed , lie down and be depressed . We have so many people who cannot see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one . So they are going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning . Well , now , if government planning and welfare had the answer and they have had almost 30 years of it should not we expect government to read the score to us once in a while Should not they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help The reduction in the need for public housing But the reverse is true . Each year the need grows greater the program grows greater . We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night . Well that was probably true . They were all on a diet . But now we are told that 9 . 3 million families in this country are poverty stricken on the basis of earning less than 3 , 000 dollars a year . Welfare spending 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the Depression . We are spending 45 billion dollars on welfare . Now do a little arithmetic , and you will find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families , we had be able to give each family 4 , 600 dollars a year . And this added to their present income should eliminate poverty . Direct aid to the poor , however , is only running only about 600 dollars per family . It would seem that someplace there must be some overhead . Now so now we declare war on poverty , or You , too , can be a Bobby Baker . Now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we are spending , one more program to the 30 odd we have and remember , this new program does not replace any , it just duplicates existing programs do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic Well , in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that is not duplicated . This is the youth feature . We are now going to solve the dropout problem , juvenile delinquency , by reinstituting something like the old CCC camps , and we are going to put our young people in these camps . But again we do some arithmetic , and we find that we are going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4 , 700 dollars a year . We can send them to Harvard for 2 , 700 Course , do not get me wrong . I am not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency . But seriously , what are we doing to those we seek to help Not too long ago , a judge called me here in Los Angeles . He told me of a young woman who d come before him for a divorce . She had six children , was pregnant with her seventh . Under his questioning , she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month . She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise . She is eligible for 330 dollars a month in the Aid to Dependent Children Program . She got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who d already done that very thing . Yet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do gooders , we are denounced as being against their humanitarian goals . They say we are always against things we are never for anything . Well , the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they are ignorant it is just that they know so much that is not so . Now we are for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age , and to that end we have accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the problem . But we are against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings , when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood . They have called it insurance to us in a hundred million pieces of literature . But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program . They only use the term insurance to sell it to the people . And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government , and the government has used that tax . There is no fund , because Robert Byers , the actuarial head , appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole . But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax , they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble . And they are doing just that . A young man , 21 years of age , working at an average salary his Social Security contribution would , in the open market , buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65 . The government promises 127 . He could live it up until he is 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than Social Security . Now are we so lacking in business sense that we cannot put this program on a sound basis , so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they are due that the cupboard is not bare Barry Goldwater thinks we can . At the same time , cannot we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non earning years Should we not allow a widow with children to work , and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband Should not you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program , which we cannot do I think we are for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds . But I think we are against forcing all citizens , regardless of need , into a compulsory government program , especially when we have such examples , as was announced last week , when France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt . They have come to the end of the road . In addition , was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate , planned inflation , so that when you do get your Social Security pension , a dollar will buy a dollar s worth , and not 45 cents worth I think we are for an international organization , where the nations of the world can seek peace . But I think we are against subordinating American interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world s population . I think we are against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony , while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations . I think we are for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs , but we are against doling out money government to government , creating bureaucracy , if not socialism , all over the world . We set out to help 19 countries . We are helping 107 . We have spent 146 billion dollars . With that money , we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie . We bought dress suits for Greek undertakers , extra wives for Kenya government officials . We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity . In the last six years , 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold , and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country . No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size . So governments programs , once launched , never disappear . Actually , a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth . Federal employees federal employees number two and a half million and federal , state , and local , one out of six of the nation s work force employed by government . These proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards . How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man s property without a warrant They can impose a fine without a formal hearing , let alone a trial by jury And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine . In Chico County , Arkansas , James Wier over planted his rice allotment . The government obtained a 17 , 000 dollar judgment . And a marshal sold his 960 acre farm at auction . The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work . Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota , Norman Thomas , six times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket , said , If Barry Goldwater became President , he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States . I think that is exactly what he will do . But as a former Democrat , I can tell you Norman Thomas is not the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration , because back in 1936 , Democrat himself , Al Smith , the great American , came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson , Jackson , and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx , Lenin , and Stalin . And he walked away from his Party , and he never returned til the day he died because to this day , the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party , that honorable Party , down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England . Now it does not require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people . What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property And such machinery already exists . The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute . Every businessman has his own tale of harassment . Somewhere a perversion has taken place . Our natural , unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government , and freedom has never been so fragile , so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment . Our Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues . They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men that we are to choose just between two personalities . Well what of this man that they would destroy and in destroying , they would destroy that which he represents , the ideas that you and I hold dear Is he the brash and shallow and trigger happy man they say he is Well I have been privileged to know him when . I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office , and I can tell you personally I have never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing . This is a man who , in his own business before he entered politics , instituted a profit sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it . He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees . He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program , a pension plan for all his employees . He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and could not work . He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores . When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande , he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there . An ex GI told me how he met him . It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War , and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas . And he said that a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes . And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said , Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona , go to runway such and such , and they went down there , and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane . Every day in those weeks before Christmas , all day long , he had load up the plane , fly it to Arizona , fly them to their homes , fly back over to get another load . During the hectic split second timing of a campaign , this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer . His campaign managers were understandably impatient , but he said , There are not many left who care what happens to her . I had like her to know I care . This is a man who said to his 19 year old son , There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness , and when you begin to build your life on that rock , with the cement of the faith in God that you have , then you have a real start . This is not a man who could carelessly send other people s sons to war . And that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems I have discussed academic , unless we realize we are in a war that must be won . Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory . They call their policy accommodation . And they say if we will only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy , he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us . All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers . They say we offer simple answers to complex problems . Well , perhaps there is a simple answer not an easy answer but simple If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right . We cannot buy our security , our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain , Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins , we are willing to make a deal with your slave masters . Alexander Hamilton said , A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master , and deserves one . Now let us set the record straight . There is no argument over the choice between peace and war , but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace and you can have it in the next second surrender . Admittedly , there is a risk in any course we follow other than this , but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement , and this is the specter our well meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is appeasement , and it gives no choice between peace and war , only between fight or surrender . If we continue to accommodate , continue to back and retreat , eventually we have to face the final demand the ultimatum . And what then when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be He has told them that we are retreating under the pressure of the Cold War , and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum , our surrender will be voluntary , because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually , morally , and economically . He believes this because from our side he is heard voices pleading for peace at any price or better Red than dead , or as one commentator put it , he had rather live on his knees than die on his feet . And therein lies the road to war , because those voices do not speak for the rest of us . You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery . If nothing in life is worth dying for , when did this begin just in the face of this enemy Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs Should Christ have refused the cross Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard round the world The martyrs of history were not fools , and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis did not die in vain . Where , then , is the road to peace Well it is a simple answer after all . You and I have the courage to say to our enemies , There is a price we will not pay . There is a point beyond which they must not advance . And this this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater s peace through strength . Winston Churchill said , The destiny of man is not measured by material computations . When great forces are on the move in the world , we learn we are spirits not animals . And he said , There is something going on in time and space , and beyond time and space , which , whether we like it or not , spells duty . You and I have a rendezvous with destiny . We will preserve for our children this , the last best hope of man on earth , or we will sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness . We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has faith in us . He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>President , General Secretary , distinguished delegates Half a world away from this place of peace , the firing , the killing , the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have , for the first time in recent memory , diminished . After adding terrible new names to the roll call of human horror names such as Halabja , Maidan Shahr , and Spin Buldak there is today hope of peace in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan . So , too , in the highlands and coastal cities of southern Africa places of civil war , places of occupation by foreign troops talk of peace is heard , peace for the tortured nation of Angola . Sixty five hundred miles east , in the Southeast Asian country of Cambodia , there is hope now of a settlement the removal of Vietnam s occupying forces . And finally , in this hemisphere , where only 12 years ago one third of the people of Latin America lived under democratic rule , some 90 percent do so today and especially in Central America , nations such as El Salvador , once threatened by the anarchy of the death squad and the specter of totalitarian rule , now know the hope of self government and the prospect of economic growth . And another change , Secretary General , a change that , if it endures , may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history , a change that is a cause for shaking of the head in wonder , is also upon us a change going to the source of postwar tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war . For the first time , the differences between East and West fundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with the worth of the individual and whether governments shall control people or people control governments for the first time , these differences have shown signs of easing , easing to the point where there are not just troop withdrawals from places like Afghanistan but also talk in the East of reform and greater freedom of press , of assembly , and of religion . Yes , fundamental differences remain . But should talk of reform become more than that , should it become reality , there is the prospect of not only a new era in Soviet American relations but a new age of world peace . For such reform can bring peace , history teaches . And my country has always believed that where the rights of the individual and the people are enshrined , war is a distant prospect . For it is not people who make war only governments do that . I stand at this podium , then , in a moment of hope hope not just for the peoples of the United States or the Soviet Union but for all the peoples of the world and hope , too , for the dream of peace among nations , the dream that began the United Nations . Precisely because of these changes , today the United Nations has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before . Already , you , Secretary General , through your persistence , patience , and unyielding will , have shown , in working toward peace in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf , how valuable the United Nations can be . And we salute you for these accomplishments . In Geneva at this very hour , there are numerous negotiations underway multilateral negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues between the Soviets and ourselves . And these negotiations , some of them under auspices , involve a broad arms control agenda strategic offensive weapons and space , nuclear testing and chemical warfare whose urgency we have witnessed anew in recent days . And , Secretary General , the negotiators are busy . And over the last few years , they have been engaged in more than an academic exercise . There is movement . The logjam is broken . Only recently , when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the INF agreement , an entire class of and Soviet nuclear missiles was eliminated for the first time in history . Progress continues on negotiations to reduce , in massive number , strategic weapons with effective verification . And talks will begin soon on conventional reductions in Europe . Much of the reason for all of this goes back , I believe , to Geneva itself , to the small chateau along the lake where I and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union had the first of several fireside chats , exchanges characterized by frankness , but friendliness , too . I said at the first meeting in Geneva that this was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to start world war III or to begin a new age of peace among nations . And I also said peace conferences , arms negotiations , proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context , a context that sought to explore and resolve the deeper , underlying differences between us . I said to Gorbachev then , as I have said to you before Nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed they are armed because they mistrust each other . And in that place , by that peaceful lake in neutral Switzerland , Gorbachev and I did begin a new relationship based not just on engagement over the single issue of arms control but on a broader agenda about our deeper differences an agenda of human rights , regional conflicts , and bilateral exchanges between our peoples . Even on the arms control issue itself , we agreed to go beyond the past , to seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to higher levels but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced and even eliminated a whole class of nuclear weapons . What was begun that morning in Geneva has shown results in the INF treaty in my recent visit to Moscow in my opportunity to meet there with Soviet citizens and dissidents and speak of human rights , and to speak , too , in the Lenin Hills of Moscow to the young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder and splendor of human freedom . The results of that morning in Geneva are seen in peace conferences now underway around the world on regional conflicts and in the work of the here in New York as well as in Geneva . But , Secretary General , history teaches caution . Indeed , that very building in Geneva where important negotiations have taken place the Geneva accords on Afghanistan , the Iran Iraq negotiations , for example we see it today as stonelike testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time . The Palais des Nations was the headquarters of the League of Nations , an institution that was to symbolize an end to all war . And yet today that institution and its noble purpose ended with the Second World War ended because the chance for peace was not seized in the 1930 s by the nations of the world ended because humanity did not find the courage to isolate the aggressors , to reject schemes of government that serve the state , not the people . We are here today , Secretary General , determined that no such fate shall befall the United Nations . We are determined that the should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind . So , Secretary General , we realize that , even in this time of hope , the chance of failure is real . But this knowledge does not discourage us it spurs us on . For the stakes are high . Do we falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future generations Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution and see to it that , at last , freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer and that this place , this floor , shall be truly the world s last battlefield We are determined it shall be so . So , we turn now to the agenda of peace . Let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Gorbachev in the Kremlin , as well as on the minds of Soviet citizens that I met in Moscow . It is also an issue that I know is of immediate importance to the delegates of this Assembly , who this fall commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . That declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the greatest peril that peace rests on one foundation observing the inalienable rights of all members of the human family . In a century where human rights have been denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in history , with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated as a matter of state policy a history , it has been said , of blood , stupidity , and barbed wire few can wonder why peace has proved so elusive . Now , let us understand If we would have peace , we must acknowledge the elementary rights of our fellow human beings . In our own land and in other lands , if we would have peace , the trampling of the human spirit must cease . Human rights is not for some , some of the time . Human rights , as the universal declaration of this Assembly adopted in 1948 proclaims , is for all people and all nations , and for all time . This regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the Those who starve in Ethiopia , those who die among the Kurds , those who face racial injustice in South Africa , those who still cannot write or speak freely in the Soviet Union , those who cannot worship in the Ukraine , those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in the South China Sea , those who cannot publish or assemble in Managua all of this is more than just an agenda item on your calendar . It must be a first concern , an issue above others . For when human rights concerns are not paramount at the United Nations , when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not honored in these halls and meeting rooms , then the very credibility of this organization is at stake , the very purpose of its existence in question . That is why when human rights progress is made , the United Nations grows stronger and the United States is glad of it . Following a 2 year effort led by the United States , for example , the Human Rights Commission took a major step toward ending the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much of its past . For years , Cuba , a blatant violator of its citizens human rights , has escaped censure or even scrutiny . This year , Cuba has responded to pressure generated by the Human Rights Commission by accepting an investigation into its human rights abuses . Fidel Castro has already begun to free some political prisoners , improve prison conditions , and tolerate the existence of a small , independent national human rights group . More must be done . The United Nations must be relentless and unyielding in seeking change in Cuba and elsewhere . And we must also see to it that the Universal Declaration itself should not be debased with episodes like the zionism is racism resolution . Respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of this body , the most elementary obligation of its members . Indeed , wherever one turns in the world today , there is new awareness , a growing passion for human rights . The people of the world grow united new groups , new coalitions form coalitions that monitor government , that work against discrimination , that fight religious or political repression , unlawful imprisonment , torture , or execution . As those I spoke to at Spaso House said to me last June , such movements make a difference . Turning now to regional conflicts , we feel again the uplift of hope . In the Gulf war between Iran and Iraq , one of the bloodiest conflicts since World War Iwe have a cease fire . The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the Persian Gulf open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law , it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace . So , too , the Security Council s decisive resolution in July a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful Gulf . Let this war a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished , only victims let this war end now . Let both Iran and Iraq cooperate with the Secretary General and the Security Council in implementing Resolution 598 . Let peace come . Moving on to a second region When I first addressed the General Assembly in 1983 , world attention was focused on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of Afghanistan . After nearly 9 long years of war , the courage and determination of the Afghan people and the Afghan freedom fighters have held sway , and today an end to the occupation is in sight . On April 14 , the S . signed the Geneva accords , which were negotiated under auspices by Pakistan and the Kabul regime . We encourage the Soviet Union to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interference . In southern Africa , too , years of patient diplomacy and support for those in Angola who seek self determination are having their effect . We look forward to an accord between the Governments of Angola , Cuba , and South Africa that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops , primarily Cuban , from Angola . We look forward as well to full implementation of Security Council Resolution 435 and our longstanding goal of independence for Namibia . We continue to support a growing consensus among African leaders who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there is national reconciliation within Angola . Secretary General , there are new hopes for Cambodia , a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and independence of Afghanistan . We urge the rapid removal of all Vietnamese troops and a settlement that will prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge to power , permitting instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government a government that will , at last , respect fully the rights of the people of Cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly borne . In other critical areas , we applaud the Secretary General s efforts to structure a referendum on the western Sahara . And in the Mediterranean , direct talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities hold much promise for accord in that divided island nation . And finally , we look to a peaceful solution to the Arab Israeli conflict . So , too , the unnatural division of Europe remains a critical obstacle to Soviet American relations . In most of these areas , then , we see progress , and again , we are glad of it . Only a few years ago , all of these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control . Indeed , the invasion of Afghanistan and the apparent will among democratic and peace loving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic , a climate the world has not seen since the 1930 s . Only this time , larger war was avoided , avoided because the free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of purpose and will . And now the United Nations is providing valuable assistance in helping this epidemic to recede . And because we are resolved to keep it so , I would be remiss in my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflicts . I refer here to the continuing deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international community . This elite , in calling itself revolutionary , seeks no real revolution the use of the term is subterfuge , deception for hiding the oldest , most corrupt vice of all man s age old will to power , his lust to control the lives and steal the freedom of others . And that is why , as President , I will continue to urge the Congress and the American public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua , that the United States will continue to stand with those who are threatened by this regime s aggression against its neighbors in Central America . Today I also call on the Soviet Union to show in Central America the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in other regional conflicts to assist in bringing conflict in Central America to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime , a regime whose goals of regional domination , while ultimately doomed , can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to Soviet American relations unless action is taken now . Moving now to the arms reduction agenda , I have mentioned already the importance of the INF treaty and the momentum developed in the START negotiations . The draft START treaty is a lengthy document , filled with bracketed language designating sections of disagreement between the two sides . But through this summer in Geneva , those brackets have diminished . There is every reason to believe this process can continue . I can tell this Assembly that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months , but I can tell you a year from now is a possibility more than a possibility . But we have no deadline . No agreement is better than a bad agreement . The United States remains hopeful , and we acknowledge the spirit of cooperation shown by the Soviet Union in these negotiations . We also look for that spirit to be applied to our concerns about compliance with existing agreements . So , too , our discussions on nuclear testing and defense and space have been useful . But let me here stress to this General Assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear arms control negotiations is due to technological progress itself , especially in the potential for space based defensive systems . I believe that the United States determination to research and develop and , when ready , deploy such defensive systems systems targeted to destroy missiles , not people accounts for a large share of the progress made in recent years in Geneva . With such systems , for the first time , in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere , major powers will not be faced with the single option of massive retaliation but will instead have the chance of a saner choice to shield against an attack instead of avenging it . So , too , as defensive systems grow in effectiveness , they reduce the threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals . Only recently , briefings I have received in the Oval Office indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at first thought . Today the United States reaffirms its commitment to its Strategic Defense Initiative and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defenses with others . And yet , even as diplomatic and technological progress holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror we have lived under in the postwar era , even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world , a terror we thought the world had put behind , a terror that looms at us now from the long buried past , from ghostly , scarring trenches and the haunting , wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time poison gas , chemical warfare . Secretary General , distinguished delegates , the terror of it The horror of it We condemn it . The use of chemical weapons in the Iran Iraq war , beyond its tragic human toll , jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held those weapons in check since World War I . Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons . I call upon the signatories to that protocol , as well as other concerned states , to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty . And we urge all nations to cooperate in negotiating a verifiable , truly global ban on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva . It is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban , once and for all , and on a verifiable and global basis , the use of chemical and gas warfare . Finally , Secretary General , we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world . Likewise , proliferation in other high technology weapons , such as ballistic missiles , is reaching global proportions , exacerbating regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications . The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate , and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons . This was a matter of discussion last week between Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze . Talks between American and Soviet experts begin on this today . And we hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid having areas of tension like the Middle East become even more deadly battlegrounds than they already are . But in most of these areas , we see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions like this United Nations . That is why , now more than ever , the United Nations must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and program reform . The already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions , budgeting by consensus , and the establishment of program priorities . These actions are extremely important . The progress on reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under congressional restrictions . I expect the reform program will continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal year . And let me say here , we congratulate the United Nations on the work it has done in three areas of special concern . First , our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and state sponsored terrorism must continue . And we must also end the scourge of hostage taking . Second , the work of the World Health Organization in coordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital . All international efforts in this area must be redoubled . The AIDS crisis is a grave one . We must move as one to meet it . And so , too , is the drug crisis . We are moving now toward a new anti drug trafficking convention . This important treaty will be completed in December . I am confident other strong drug control programs will also follow . The American people are profoundly concerned and deeply angered . We will not tolerate the drug traffickers . We mean to make war on them , and we believe this is one war the United Nations can endorse and participate in . Yes , the United Nations is a better place than it was 8 years ago , and so , too , is the world . But the real issue of reform in the United Nations is not limited just to fiscal and administrative improvements but also to a higher sort of reform , an intellectual and philosophical reform , a reform of old views about the relationship between the individual and the state . Few developments , for example , have been more encouraging to the United States than the special session this body held on Africa 2 1 2 years ago , a session in which the United Nations joined as one in a call for free market incentives and a lessening of state controls to spur economic development . At one of the first international assemblies of my Presidency , in Cancun , Mexico , I said history demonstrates that , time and again , in place after place , economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides in countries that encourage economic freedom that individual farmers , laborers , owners , traders , and managers are the heart and soul of development . Trust them , because where they are allowed to create and build , where they are given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success , then societies become more dynamic , prosperous , progressive , and free . We believe in freedom . We know it works . And this , Secretary General and distinguished delegates , is the immutable lesson of the postwar era that freedom works even more , that freedom and peace work together . Every year that passes , everywhere in the world , this lesson is taking hold , from the People s Republic of China to Cameroon , from Bolivia to Botswana , and , yes , in the citadel of Marxism Leninism itself . No , my country did not invent this synergy of peace and freedom , but believe me , we impose no restrictions on the free export of our more than two centuries of experience with it . Free people blessed by economic opportunity and protected by laws that respect the dignity of the individual are not driven toward war or the domination of others . Here , then , is the way to world peace . And yet we Americans champion freedom not only because it is practical and beneficial but because it is also just , morally right . And here , Secretary General , I hope you will permit me to note that I have addressed this assemblage more than any of my predecessors and that this will be the last occasion I do so . So I hope , too , I may be permitted now some closing reflections . The world is currently witnessing another celebration of international cooperation . At the Olympics we see nations joining together in the competition of sports , and we see young people who know precious little of the resentments of their elders coming together as one . One of our young athletes from a home of modest means said that she drew the strength for her achievement from another source of wealth . We were rich as a family , she said , about the love she was given and the values she was taught . Secretary General , I dare to hope that , in the sentiment of that young athlete , we see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested values values such as family , the first and most important unit of society , where all values and learning begin an institution to be cherished and protected values , too , such as work , community , freedom , and faith . For it is here we find the deeper rationale for the cause of human rights and world peace . And our own experience on this continent the American experience though brief , has had one unmistakable encounter , an insistence on the preservation of one sacred truth . It is a truth that our first President , our Founding Father , passed on in the first farewell address made to the American people . It is a truth that I hope now you will permit me to mention in these remarks of farewell , a truth embodied in our Declaration of Independence that the case for inalienable rights , that the idea of human dignity , that the notion of conscience above compulsion can be made only in the context of higher law , only in the context of what one of the founders of this organization , Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold , has called devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves . This is the endless cycle , the final truth to which humankind seems always to return that religion and morality , that faith in something higher , are prerequisites for freedom and that justice and peace within ourselves is the first step toward justice and peace in the world and for the ages . Yes , this is a place of great debate and grave discussions . And yet I cannot help but note here that one of our Founding Fathers , the most worldly of men , an internationalist , Benjamin Franklin , interrupted the proceedings of our own Constitutional Convention to make much the same point . And I cannot help but think this morning of other beginnings , of where and when I first read those words And they shall beat their swords into plowshares . . and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams . . . This morning , my thoughts go to her who gave me many things in life , but her most important gift was the knowledge of happiness and solace to be gained in prayer . It is the greatest help I have had in my Presidency , and I recall here Lincoln s words when he said only the most foolish of men would think he could confront the duties of the office I now hold without turning to someone stronger , a power above all others . I think then of her and others like her in that small town in Illinois , gentle people who possessed something that those who hold positions of power sometimes forget to prize . No one of them could ever have imagined the boy from the banks of the Rock River would come to this moment and have this opportunity . But had they been told it would happen , I think they would have been a bit disappointed if I had not spoken here for what they knew so well that when we grow weary of the world and its troubles , when our faith in humanity falters , it is then that we must seek comfort and refreshment of spirit in a deeper source of wisdom , one greater than ourselves . And so , if future generations do say of us that in our time peace came closer , that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice , it will be cause for pride . But it shall be a cause of greater pride , still , if it is also said that we were wise enough to know the deliberations of great leaders and great bodies are but overture , that the truly majestic music the music of freedom , of justice , and peace is the music made in forgetting self and seeking in silence the will of Him who made us . Thank you for your hospitality over the years . I bid you now farewell , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , distinguished members of the Congress , honored guests , and fellow citizens Once again , in keeping with time honored tradition , I have come to report to you on the state of the Union , and I am pleased to report that America is much improved , and there is good reason to believe that improvement will continue through the days to come . You and I have had some honest and open differences in the year past . But they did not keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to stop a long decline that had drained this nation s spirit and eroded its health . There is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land . America is back , standing tall , looking to the 80s with courage , confidence , and hope . The problems we are overcoming are not the heritage of one person , party , or even one generation . It is just the tendency of government to grow , for practices and programs to become the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this Earth . And there is always that well intentioned chorus of voices saying , With a little more power and a little more money , we could do so much for the people . For a time we forgot the American dream is not one of making government bigger it is keeping faith with the mighty spirit of free people under God . As we came to the decade of the 80s , we faced the worst crisis in our postwar history . In the 70s were years of rising problems and falling confidence . There was a feeling government had grown beyond the consent of the governed . Families felt helpless in the face of mounting inflation and the indignity of taxes that reduced reward for hard work , thrift , and risktaking . All this was overlaid by an evergrowing web of rules and regulations . On the international scene , we had an uncomfortable feeling that we had lost the respect of friend and foe . Some questioned whether we had the will to defend peace and freedom . But America is too great for small dreams . There was a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival if you will , a crusade for renewal . The American people said Let us look to the future with confidence , both at home and abroad . Let us give freedom a chance . Americans were ready to make a new beginning , and together we have done it . We are confronting our problems one by one . Hope is alive tonight for millions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair tax increases and crushing inflation . Inflation has been beaten down from 12 . 4 to 3 . 2 percent , and that is a great victory for all the people . The prime rate has been cut almost in half , and we must work together to bring it down even more . Together , we passed the first across the board tax reduction for everyone since the Kennedy tax cuts . Next year , tax rates will be indexed so inflation cannot push people into higher brackets when they get cost of living pay raises . Government must never again use inflation to profit at the people s expense . Today a working family earning 25 , 000 has 1 , 100 more in purchasing power than if tax and inflation rates were still at the 1980 levels . Real after tax income increased 5 percent last year . And economic deregulation of key industries like transportation has offered more chances or choices , I should say , to consumers and new changes or chances for entrepreneurs and protecting safety . Tonight , we can report and be proud of one of the best recoveries in decades . Send away the handwringers and the doubting Thomases . Hope is reborn for couples dreaming of owning homes and for risktakers with vision to create tomorrow s opportunities . The spirit of enterprise is sparked by the sunrise industries of high tech and by small business people with big ideas people like Barbara Proctor , who rose from a ghetto to build a multimillion dollar advertising agency in Chicago Carlos Perez , a Cuban refugee , who turned 27 and a dream into a successful importing business in Coral Gables , Florida . People like these are heroes for the 80s . They helped four million Americans find jobs in 1983 . More people are drawing paychecks tonight than ever before . And Congress helps or progress helps everyone well , Congress does too everyone . In 1983 women filled 73 percent of all the new jobs in managerial , professional , and technical fields . But we know that many of our fellow countrymen are still out of work , wondering what will come of their hopes and dreams . Can we love America and not reach out to tell them You are not forgotten we will not rest until each of you can reach as high as your God given talents will take you . The heart of America is strong it is good and true . The cynics were wrong America never was a sick society . We are seeing rededication to bedrock values of faith , family , work , neighborhood , peace , and freedom values that help bring us together as one people , from the youngest child to the most senior citizen . The Congress deserves America s thanks for helping us restore pride and credibility to our military . And I hope that you are as proud as I am of the young men and women in uniform who have volunteered to man the ramparts in defense of freedom and whose dedication , valor , and skill increases so much our chance of living in a world at peace . People everywhere hunger for peace and a better life . The tide of the future is a freedom tide , and our struggle for democracy cannot and will not be denied . This nation champions peace that enshrines liberty , democratic rights , and dignity for every individual . America s new strength , confidence , and purpose are carrying hope and opportunity far from our shores . A world economic recovery is underway . It began here . We have journeyed far , but we have much farther to go . Franklin Roosevelt told us 50 years ago this month Civilization can not go back civilization must not stand still . We have undertaken new methods . It is our task to perfect , to improve , to alter when necessary , but in all cases to go forward . It is time to move forward again , time for America to take freedom s next step . Let us unite tonight behind four great goals to keep America free , secure , and at peace in the 80s together . We can ensure steady economic growth . We can develop America s next frontier . We can strengthen our traditional values . And we can build a meaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of faith that has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom , progress , and hope . Doing these things will open wider the gates of opportunity , provide greater security for all , with no barriers of bigotry or discrimination . The key to a dynamic decade is vigorous economic growth , our first great goal . We might well begin with common sense in federal budgeting government spending no more than government takes in . We must bring federal deficits down . But how we do that makes all the difference . We can begin by limiting the size and scope of government . Under the leadership of Vice President Bush , we have reduced the growth of federal regulations by more than 25 percent and cut well over 300 million hours of government required paperwork each year . This will save the public more than 150 billion over the next 10 years . The Grace Commission has given us some 2 , 500 recommendations for reducing wasteful spending , and they are being examined throughout the administration . Federal spending growth has been cut from 17 . 4 percent in 1980 to less than half of that today , and we have already achieved over 300 billion in budget savings for the period of 1982 to 86 . But that is only a little more than half of what we sought . Government is still spending too large a percentage of the total economy . Now , some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained by reducing the portion spent on defense . This ignores the fact that national defense is solely the responsibility of the federal government indeed , it is its prime responsibility . And yet defense spending is less than a third of the total budget . During the years of President Kennedy and of the years before that , defense was almost half the total budget . And then came several years in which our military capability was allowed to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree . We are just now restoring , through the essential modernization of our conventional and strategic forces , our capability to meet our present and future security needs . We dare not shirk our responsibility to keep America free , secure , and at peace . The last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control . But the basis for such spending had been laid in previous years . A pattern of overspending has been in place for half a century . As the national debt grew , we were told not to worry , that we owed it to ourselves . Now we know that deficits are a cause for worry . But there is a difference of opinion as to whether taxes should be increased , spending cut , or some of both . Fear is expressed that government borrowing to fund the deficit could inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital needed for business and industrial expansion . Well , I think that debate is missing an important point . Whether government borrows or increases taxes , it will be taking the same amount of money from the private sector , and , either way , that is too much . Simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes on families struggling to pay their bills . The root of the problem is that government s share is more than we can afford if we are to have a sound economy . We must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth . In the budget that I will submit on February 1 , I will recommend measures that will reduce the deficit over the next five years . Many of these will be unfinished business from last year s budget . Some could be enacted quickly if we could join in a serious effort to address this problem . I spoke today with Speaker of the House O Neill , Senate Majority Leader Baker , Senate Minority Leader Byrd , and House Minority Leader Michel . I asked them if they would designate congressional representatives to meet with representatives of the administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan . I know it would take a long , hard struggle to agree on a full scale plan . So , what I have proposed is that we first see if we can agree on a down payment . Now , I believe there is basis for such an agreement , one that could reduce the deficits by about 100 billion over the next three years . We could focus on some of the less contentious spending cuts that are still pending before the Congress . These could be combined with measures to close certain tax loopholes , measures that the Treasury Department has previously said to be worthy of support . In addition , we could examine the possibility of achieving further outlay savings based on the work of the Grace Commission . If the congressional leadership is willing , my representatives will be prepared to meet with theirs at the earliest possible time . I would hope the leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to develop and enact that down payment . But a down payment alone is not enough to break us out of the deficit problem . It could help us start on the right path . Yet , we must do more . So , I propose that we begin exploring how together we can make structural reforms to curb the built in growth of spending . I also propose improvements in the budgeting process . Some 43 of our 50 states grant their Governors the right to veto individual items in appropriation bills without having to veto the entire bill . California is one of those 43 states . As Governor , I found this line item veto was a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending . It works in 43 states . Let us put it to work in Washington for all the people . It would be most effective if done by constitutional amendment . The majority of Americans approve of such an amendment , just as they and I approve of an amendment mandating a balanced federal budget . Many states also have this protection in their constitutions . To talk of meeting the present situation by increasing taxes is a Band Aid solution which does nothing to cure an illness that is been coming on for half a century to say nothing of the fact that it poses a real threat to economic recovery . Let us remember that a substantial amount of income tax is presently owed and not paid by people in the underground economy . It would be immoral to make those who are paying taxes pay more to compensate for those who are not paying their share . There is a better way . Let us go forward with an historic reform for fairness , simplicity , and incentives for growth . I am asking Secretary Don Regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code , so all taxpayers , big and small , are treated more fairly . And I believe such a plan could result in that underground economy being brought into the sunlight of honest tax compliance . And it could make the tax base broader , so personal tax rates could come down , not go up . I have asked that specific recommendations , consistent with those objectives , be presented to me by December 1984 . Our second great goal is to build on America s pioneer spirit I said something funny I said America s next frontier and that is to develop that frontier . A sparkling economy spurs initiatives , sunrise industries , and makes older ones more competitive . Nowhere is this more important than our next frontier space . Nowhere do we so effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to make life better on Earth . The Space Age is barely a quarter of a century old . But already we have pushed civilization forward with our advances in science and technology . Opportunities and jobs will multiply as we cross new thresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the unknown . Our progress in space taking giant steps for all mankind is a tribute to American teamwork and excellence . Our finest minds in government , industry , and academia have all pulled together . And we can be proud to say We are first we are the best and we are so because we are free . America has always been greatest when we dared to be great . We can reach for greatness again . We can follow our dreams to distant stars , living and working in space for peaceful , economic , and scientific gain . Tonight , I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade . A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science , communications , in metals , and in lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space . We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits . NASA will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace , build prosperity , and expand freedom for all who share our goals . Just as the oceans opened up a new world for clipper ships and Yankee traders , space holds enormous potential for commerce today . The market for space transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it . Companies interested in putting payloads into space must have ready access to private sector launch services . The Department of Transportation will help an expendable launch services industry to get off the ground . We will soon implement a number of executive initiatives , develop proposals to ease regulatory constraints , and , with NASA s help , promote private sector investment in space . And as we develop the frontier of space , let us remember our responsibility to preserve our older resources here on Earth . Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge , it is common sense . Though this is a time of budget constraints , I have requested for EPA one of the largest percentage budget increases of any agency . We will begin the long , necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a special national resource the Chesapeake Bay . To reduce the threat posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps , EPA will spend 410 million . And I will request a supplemental increase of 50 million . And because the Superfund law expires in 1985 , I have asked Bill Ruckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so there ll be additional time to complete this important task . On the question of acid rain , which concerns people in many areas of the United States and Canada , I am proposing a research program that doubles our current funding . And we will take additional action to restore our lakes and develop new technology to reduce pollution that causes acid rain . We have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources . We will ask the Congress for 157 million beginning in 1985 to acquire new park and conservation lands . The Department of the Interior will encourage careful , selective exploration and production on our vital resources in an Exclusive Economic Zone within the 200 mile limit off our coasts but with strict adherence to environmental laws and with fuller state and public participation . But our most precious resources , our greatest hope for the future , are the minds and hearts of our people , especially our children . We can help them build tomorrow by strengthening our community of shared values . This must be our third great goal . For us , faith , work , family , neighborhood , freedom , and peace are not just words they are expressions of what America means , definitions of what makes us a good and loving people . Families stand at the center of our society . And every family has a personal stake in promoting excellence in education . Excellence does not begin in Washington . A 600 percent increase in federal spending on education between 1960 and 1980 was accompanied by a steady decline in Scholastic Aptitude Test scores . Excellence must begin in our homes and neighborhood schools , where it is the responsibility of every parent and teacher and the right of every child . Our children come first , and that is why I established a bipartisan National Commission on Excellence in Education , to help us chart a commonsense course for better education . And already , communities are implementing the Commission s recommendations . Schools are reporting progress in math and reading skills . But we must do more to restore discipline to schools and we must encourage the teaching of new basics , reward teachers of merit , enforce tougher standards , and put our parents back in charge . I will continue to press for tuition tax credits to expand opportunities for families and to soften the double payment for those paying public school taxes and private school tuition . Our proposal would target assistance to low and middle income families . Just as more incentives are needed within our schools , greater competition is needed among our schools . Without standards and competition , there can be no champions , no records broken , no excellence in education or any other walk of life . And while I am on this subject , each day your members observe a 200 year old tradition meant to signify America is one nation under God . I must ask If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer , then why cannot freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land America was founded by people who believed that God was their rock of safety . He is ours . I recognize we must be cautious in claiming that God is on our side , but I think it is all right to keep asking if we are on His side . During our first three years , we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore protection of the law to unborn children . Now , I know this issue is very controversial . But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn child is not a living human being , can we justify assuming without proof that it is not No one has yet offered such proof indeed , all the evidence is to the contrary . We should rise above bitterness and reproach , and if Americans could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping , then we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion . Economic recovery , better education , rededication to values , all show the spirit of renewal gaining the upper hand . And all will improve family life in the 80s . But families need more . They need assurance that they and their loved ones can walk the streets of America without being afraid . Parents need to know their children will not be victims of child pornography and abduction . This year we will intensify our drive against these and other horrible crimes like sexual abuse and family violence . Already our efforts to crack down on career criminals , organized crime , drugpushers , and to enforce tougher sentences and paroles are having effect . In 1982 the crime rate dropped by 4 . 3 percent , the biggest decline since 1972 . Protecting victims is just as important as safeguarding the rights of defendants . Opportunities for all Americans will increase if we move forward in fair housing and work to ensure women s rights , provide for equitable treatment in pension benefits and Individual Retirement Accounts , facilitate child care , and enforce delinquent parent support payments . It is not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our values and shape our future . So , I ask your help in assisting more communities to break the bondage of dependency . Help us to free enterprise by permitting debate and voting yes on our proposal for enterprise zones in America . This has been before you for two years . Its passage can help high unemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring neighborhoods . A society bursting with opportunities , reaching for its future with confidence , sustained by faith , fair play , and a conviction that good and courageous people will flourish when they are free these are the secrets of a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world . A lasting and meaningful peace is our fourth great goal . It is our highest aspiration . And our record is clear Americans resort to force only when we must . We have never been aggressors . We have always struggled to defend freedom and democracy . We have no territorial ambitions . We occupy no countries . We build no walls to lock people in . Americans build the future . And our vision of a better life for farmers , merchants , and working people , from the Americas to Asia , begins with a simple premise The future is best decided by ballots , not bullets . Governments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war on their neighbors . Only when people are given a personal stake in deciding their own destiny , benefiting from their own risks , do they create societies that are prosperous , progressive , and free . Tonight , it is democracies that offer hope by feeding the hungry , prolonging life , and eliminating drudgery . When it comes to keeping America strong , free , and at peace , there should be no Republicans or Democrats , just patriotic Americans . We can decide the tough issues not by who is right , but by what is right . Together , we can continue to advance our agenda for peace . We can establish a more stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet Union strengthen allied relations across the board achieve real and equitable reductions in the levels of nuclear arms reinforce our peacemaking efforts in the Middle East , Central America , and southern Africa or assist developing countries , particularly our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere and assist in the development of democratic institutions throughout the world . The wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of the Scowcroft Commission , which strengthened our ability to deter war and protect peace . In that same spirit , I urge you to move forward with the Henry Jackson plan to implement the recommendations of the Bipartisan Commission on Central America . Your joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon is also serving the cause of peace . We are making progress in Lebanon . For nearly 10 years , the Lebanese have lived from tragedy to tragedy with no hope for their future . Now the multinational peacekeeping force and our marines are helping them break their cycle of despair . There is hope for a free , independent , and sovereign Lebanon . We must have the courage to give peace a chance . And we must not be driven from our objectives for peace in Lebanon by state sponsored terrorism . We have seen this ugly specter in Beirut , Kuwait , and Rangoon . It demands international attention . I will forward shortly legislative proposals to help combat terrorism . And I will be seeking support from our allies for concerted action . Our NATO alliance is strong . 1983 was a banner year for political courage . And we have strengthened our partnerships and our friendships in the Far East . We are committed to dialog , deterrence , and promoting prosperity . We will work with our trading partners for a new round of negotiations in support of freer world trade , greater competition , and more open markets . A rebirth of bipartisan cooperation , of economic growth , and military deterrence , and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and our allies abroad underline a fundamental and far reaching change The United States is safer , stronger , and more secure in 1984 than before . We can now move with confidence to seize the opportunities for peace , and we will . Tonight , I want to speak to the people of the Soviet Union , to tell them it is true that our governments have had serious differences , but our sons and daughters have never fought each other in war . And if we Americans have our way , they never will . People of the Soviet Union , there is only one sane policy , for your country and mine , to preserve our civilization in this modern age A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought . The only value in our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will never be used . But then would it not be better to do away with them entirely People of the Soviet , President Dwight Eisenhower , who fought by your side in World War Isaid the essential struggle is not merely man against man or nation against nation . It is man against war . Americans are people of peace . If your government wants peace , there will be peace . We can come together in faith and friendship to build a safer and far better world for our children and our children s children . And the whole world will rejoice . That is my message to you . Some days when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us or a friend to help us , we find a person who reminds us what it means to be Americans . Sergeant Stephen Trujillo , a medic in the 2nd Ranger Battalion , 75th Infantry , was in the first helicopter to land at the compound held by Cuban forces in Grenada . He saw three other helicopters crash . Despite the imminent explosion of the burning aircraft , he never hesitated . He ran across 25 yards of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers . He directed two other medics , administered first aid , and returned again and again to the crash site to carry his wounded friends to safety . Sergeant Trujillo , you and your fellow service men and women not only saved innocent lives you set a nation free . You inspire us as a force for freedom , not for despotism and , yes , for peace , not conquest . God bless you . And then there are unsung heroes single parents , couples , church and civic volunteers . Their hearts carry without complaint the pains of family and community problems . They soothe our sorrow , heal our wounds , calm our fears , and share our joy . A person like Father Ritter is always there . His Covenant House programs in New York and Houston provide shelter and help to thousands of frightened and abused children each year . The same is true of Charles Carson . Paralyzed in a plane crash , he still believed nothing is impossible . Today in Minnesota , he works 80 hours a week without pay , helping pioneer the field of computer controlled walking . He has given hope to 500 , 000 paralyzed Americans that some day they may walk again . How can we not believe in the greatness of America How can we not do what is right and needed to preserve this last best hope of man on Earth After all our struggles to restore America , to revive confidence in our country , hope for our future , after all our hard won victories earned through the patience and courage of every citizen , we cannot , must not , and will not turn back . We will finish our job . How could we do less We are Americans . Carl Sandburg said , I see America not in the setting sun of a black night of despair . . . I see America in the crimson light of a rising sun fresh from the burning , creative hand of God . . . I see great days ahead for men and women of will and vision . I have never felt more strongly that America s best days and democracy s best days lie ahead . We are a powerful force for good . With faith and courage , we can perform great deeds and take freedom s next step . And we will . We will carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought light where there was darkness , warmth where there was cold , medicine where there was disease , food where there was hunger , and peace where there was only bloodshed . Let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time , that in our time we did everything that could be done . We finished the race we kept them free we kept the faith . Thank you very much . God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , Members of the Congress , distinguished guests , and my fellow Americans It is great to be home , and Nancy and I thank you for this wonderful homecoming . And before I go on , I want to say a personal thank you to Nancy . She was an outstanding Ambassador of good will for all of us . She did not know I was going to say that . Speaker , Senator Dole , I want you to know that your statements of support here were greatly appreciated . You cannot imagine how much it means in dealing with the Soviets to have the Congress , the allies , and the American people firmly behind you . I guess you know that I have just come from Geneva and talks with General Secretary Gorbachev . In the past few days , the past 2 days , we spent over 15 hours in various meetings with the General Secretary and the members of his official party . And approximately 5 of those hours were talks between Gorbachev and myself , just one on one . That was the best part our fireside summit . There will be , I know , a great deal of commentary and opinion as to what the meetings produced and what they were like . There were over 3 , 000 reporters in Geneva , so it is possible there will be 3 , 000 opinions on what happened . So , maybe it is the old broadcaster in me , but I decided to file my own report directly to you . We met , as we had to meet . I called for a fresh start , and we made that start . I cannot claim that we had a meeting of the minds on such fundamentals as ideology or national purpose , but we understand each other better , and that is a key to peace . I gained a better perspective I feel he did , too . It was a constructive meeting so constructive , in fact , that I look forward to welcoming Gorbachev to the United States next year . And I have accepted his invitation to go to Moscow the following year . We arranged that out in the parking lot . I found Gorbachev to be an energetic defender of Soviet policy . He was an eloquent speaker and a good listener . Our subject matter was shaped by the facts of this century . These past 40 years have not been an easy time for the West or for the world . You know the facts there is no need to recite the historical record . Suffice it to say that the United States cannot afford illusions about the nature of the S . We cannot assume that their ideology and purpose will change this implies enduring competition . Our task is to assure that this competition remains peaceful . With all that divides us , we cannot afford to let confusion complicate things further . We must be clear with each other and direct . We must pay each other the tribute of candor . When I took the oath of office for the first time , we began dealing with the Soviet Union in a way that was more realistic than in , say , the recent past . And so , in a very real sense , preparations for the summit started not months ago , but 5 years ago when , with the help of Congress , we began strengthening our economy , restoring our national will , and rebuilding our defenses and alliances . America is once again strong , and our strength has given us the ability to speak with confidence and see that no true opportunity to advance freedom and peace is lost . We must not now abandon policies that work . I need your continued support to keep America strong . That is the history behind the Geneva summit , and that is the context in which it occurred . And may I add that we were especially eager that our meetings give a push to important talks already underway on reducing nuclear weapons . On this subject it would be foolish not to go the extra mile or , in this case , the extra 4 , 000 miles . We discussed the great issues of our time . I made clear before the first meeting that no question would be swept aside , no issue buried , just because either side found it uncomfortable or inconvenient . I brought these questions to the summit and put them before Gorbachev . We discussed nuclear arms and how to reduce them . I explained our proposals for equitable , verifiable , and deep reductions . I outlined my conviction that our proposals would make not just for a world that feels safer , but one that really is safer . I am pleased to report tonight that General Secretary Gorbachev and I did make a measure of progress here . We have a long way to go , but we are still heading in the right direction . We moved arms control forward from where we were last January , when the Soviets returned to the table . We are both instructing our negotiators to hasten their vital work . The world is waiting for results . Specifically , we agreed in Geneva that each side should move to cut offensive nuclear arms by 50 percent in appropriate categories . In our joint statement we called for early progress on this , turning the talks toward our chief goal offensive reductions . We called for an interim accord on intermediate range nuclear forces , leading , I hope , to the complete elimination of this class of missiles and all of this with tough verification . We also made progress in combating , together , the spread of nuclear weapons , an arms control area in which we have cooperated effectively over the years . We are also opening a dialog on combating the spread and use of chemical weapons , while moving to ban them altogether . Other arms control dialogs in Vienna on conventional forces and in Stockholm on lessening the chances for surprise attack in Europe also received a boost . And finally , we agreed to begin work on risk reduction centers , a decision that should give special satisfaction to Senators Nunn and Warner who so ably promoted this idea . I described our Strategic Defense Initiative , our research effort , that envisions the possibility of defensive systems which could ultimately protect all nations against the danger of nuclear war . This discussion produced a very direct exchange of views . Gorbachev insisted that we might use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapons into space and establish nuclear superiority . I made it clear that SDI has nothing to do with offensive weapons that , instead , we are investigating nonnuclear defense systems that would only threaten offensive missiles , not people . If our research succeeds , it will bring much closer the safer , more stable world that we seek . Nations could defend themselves against missile attack and mankind , at long last , escape the prison of mutual terror . And this is my dream . So , I welcomed the chance to tell Gorbachev that we are a nation that defends , rather than attacks that our alliances are defensive , not offensive . We do not seek nuclear superiority . We do not seek a first strike advantage over the Soviet Union . Indeed , one of my fundamental arms control objectives is to get rid of first strike weapons altogether . This is why we have proposed a 50 percent reduction in the most threatening nuclear weapons , especially those that could carry out a first strike . I went further in expressing our peaceful intentions . I described our proposal in the Geneva negotiations for a reciprocal program of open laboratories in strategic defense research . We are offering to permit Soviet experts to see firsthand that SDI does not involve offensive weapons . American scientists would be allowed to visit comparable facilities of the Soviet strategic defense program , which , in fact , has involved much more than research for many years . Finally , I reassured Gorbachev on another point . I promised that if our research reveals that a defense against nuclear missiles is possible , we would sit down with our allies and the Soviet Union to see how together we could replace all strategic ballistic missiles with such a defense , which threatens no one . We discussed threats to the peace in several regions of the world . I explained my proposals for a peace process to stop the wars in Afghanistan , Nicaragua , Ethiopia , Angola , and Cambodia those places where insurgencies that speak for the people are pitted against regimes which obviously do not represent the will or the approval of the people . I tried to be very clear about where our sympathies lie I believe I succeeded . We discussed human rights . We Americans believe that history teaches no clearer lesson than this Those countries which respect the rights of their own people tend , inevitably , to respect the rights of their neighbors . Human rights , therefore , is not an abstract moral issue it is a peace issue . Finally , we discussed the barriers to communication between our societies , and I elaborated on my proposals for real people to people contacts on a wide scale . Americans should know the people of the Soviet Union their hopes and fears and the facts of their lives . And citizens of the Soviet Union need to know of America s deep desire for peace and our unwavering attachment to freedom . As you can see , our talks were wide ranging . And let me at this point tell you what we agreed upon and what we did not . We remain far apart on a number of issues , as had to be expected . However , we reached agreement on a number of matters , and as I mentioned , we agreed to continue meeting , and this is important and very good . There is always room for movement , action , and progress when people are talking to each other instead of about each other . We have concluded a new agreement designed to bring the best of America s artists and academics to the Soviet Union . The exhibits that will be included in this exchange are one of the most effective ways for the average Soviet citizen to learn about our way of life . This agreement will also expand the opportunities for Americans to experience the Soviet people s rich cultural heritage , because their artists and academics will be coming here . We have also decided to go forward with a number of people to people initiatives that will go beyond greater contact , not only between the political leaders of our two countries but our respective students , teachers , and others as well . We have emphasized youth exchanges . And this will help break down stereotypes , build friendships , and , frankly , provide an alternative to propaganda . We have agreed to establish a new Soviet consulate in New York and a new American consulate in Kiev . And this will bring a permanent presence to the Ukraine for the first time in decades . And we have also , together with the Government of Japan , concluded a Pacific air safety agreement with the Soviet Union . This is designed to set up cooperative measures to improve civil air safety in that region of the Pacific . What happened before must never to be allowed to happen there again . And as a potential way of dealing with the energy needs of the world of the future , we have also advocated international cooperation to explore the feasibility of developing fusion energy . All of these steps are part of a long term effort to build a more stable relationship with the Soviet Union . No one ever said it could be easy , but we have come a long way . As for Soviet expansionism in a number of regions of the world while there is little chance of immediate change , we will continue to support the heroic efforts of those who fight for freedom . But we have also agreed to continue , and to intensify , our meetings with the Soviets on this and other regional conflicts and to work toward political solutions . We know the limits as well as the promise of summit meetings . This is , after all , the 11th summit of the postwar era and still the differences endure . But we believe continued meetings between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union can help bridge those differences . The fact is , every new day begins with possibilities it is up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace . Hope , therefore , is a realistic attitude and despair an uninteresting little vice . And so , was our journey worthwhile Well , 30 years ago , when Ike , President Eisenhower , had just returned from a summit in Geneva , he said , . . . the wide gulf that separates so far East and West is wide and deep . Well , today , three decades later , that is still true . But , yes , this meeting was worthwhile for both sides . A new realism spawned the summit . The summit itself was a good start , and now our byword must be steady as we go . I am , as you are , impatient for results . But good will and good hopes do not always yield lasting results , and quick fixes do not fix big problems . Just as we must avoid illusions on our side , so we must dispel them on the Soviet side . I have made it clear to Gorbachev that we must reduce the mistrust and suspicions between us if we are to do such things as reduce arms , and this will take deeds , not words alone . And I believe he is in agreement . Where do we go from here Well , our desire for improved relations is strong . We are ready and eager for step by step progress . We know that peace is not just the absence of war . We do not want a phony peace or a frail peace . We did not go in pursuit of some kind of illusory detente . We cannot be satisfied with cosmetic improvements that will not stand the test of time . We want real peace . As I flew back this evening , I had many thoughts . In just a few days families across America will gather to celebrate Thanksgiving . And again , as our forefathers who voyaged to America , we traveled to Geneva with peace as our goal and freedom as our guide . For there can be no greater good than the quest for peace and no finer purpose than the preservation of freedom . It is 350 years since the first Thanksgiving , when Pilgrims and Indians huddled together on the edge of an unknown continent . And now here we are gathered together on the edge of an unknown future , but , like our forefathers , really not so much afraid , but full of hope and trusting in God , as ever . Thank you for allowing me to talk to you this evening , and God bless you all .<speech_sep>Ladies and gentlemen , I had planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the Union , but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans . Today is a day for mourning and remembering . Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger . We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country . This is truly a national loss . Nineteen years ago , almost to the day , we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground . But we have never lost an astronaut in flight we have never had a tragedy like this . And perhaps we have forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle . But they , the Challenger Seven , were aware of the dangers , but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly . We mourn seven heroes Michael Smith , Dick Scobee , Judith Resnik , Ronald McNair , Ellison Onizuka , Gregory Jarvis , and Christa McAuliffe . We mourn their loss as a nation together . For the families of the seven , we cannot bear , as you do , the full impact of this tragedy . But we feel the loss , and we are thinking about you so very much . Your loved ones were daring and brave , and they had that special grace , that special spirit that says , Give me a challenge , and I will meet it with joy . They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths . They wished to serve , and they did . They served all of us . We have grown used to wonders in this century . It is hard to dazzle us . But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that . We have grown used to the idea of space , and perhaps we forget that we have only just begun . We are still pioneers . They , the members of the Challenger crew , were pioneers . And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle s takeoff . I know it is hard to understand , but sometimes painful things like this happen . It is all part of the process of exploration and discovery . It is all part of taking a chance and expanding man s horizons . The future does not belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave . The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future , and we will continue to follow them . I have always had great faith in and respect for our space program , and what happened today does nothing to diminish it . We do not hide our space program . We do not keep secrets and cover things up . We do it all up front and in public . That is the way freedom is , and we would not change it for a minute . We will continue our quest in space . There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and , yes , more volunteers , more civilians , more teachers in space . Nothing ends here our hopes and our journeys continue . I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades . And we know of your anguish . We share it . There is a coincidence today . On this day 390 years ago , the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama . In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans , and an historian later said , He lived by the sea , died on it , and was buried in it . Well , today we can say of the Challenger crew Their dedication was , like Drake s , complete . The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives . We will never forget them , nor the last time we saw them , this morning , as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God .<speech_sep>This is the 34th time I will speak to you from the Oval Office , and the last . We have been together eight years now , and soon it will be time for me to go . But before I do , I wanted to share some thoughts , some of which I have been saving for a long time . It is been the honor of my life to be your President . So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks , but I could say as much to you . Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve . One of the things about the Presidency is that you are always somewhat apart . You spent a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving , and seeing the people through tinted glass the parents holding up a child , and the wave you saw too late and could not return . And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass , and connect . Well , maybe I can do a little of that tonight . People ask how I feel about leaving . And the fact is , parting is such sweet sorrow . The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom . The sorrow the goodbyes , of course , and leaving this beautiful place . You know , down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the White House where the President and his family live . There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning . The view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument , and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial . But on mornings when the humidity is low , you can see past the Jefferson to the river , the Potomac , and the Virginia shore . Someone said that is the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run . I see more prosaic things the grass on the banks , the morning traffic as people make their way to work , now and then a sailboat on the river . I have been thinking a bit at that window . I have been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant and mean . And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one a small story about a big ship , and a refugee , and a sailor . It was back in the early 80s , at the height of the boat people . And the sailor was hard at work on the carrier Midway , which was patrolling the South China Sea . The sailor , like most American servicemen , was young , smart , and fiercely observant . The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat . And crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America . The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety . As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas , one spied the sailor on deck , and stood up , and called out to him . He yelled , Hello , American sailor . Hello , freedom man . A small moment with a big meaning , a moment the sailor , who wrote it in a letter , could not get out of his mind . And , when I saw it , neither could Because that is what it was to be an American in the 1980s . We stood , again , for freedom . I know we always have , but in the past few years the world again and in a way , we ourselves rediscovered it . It is been quite a journey this decade , and we held together through some stormy seas . And at the end , together , we are reaching our destination . The fact is , from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits , from the recession of 81 to 82 , to the expansion that began in late 82 and continues to this day , we have made a difference . The way I see it , there were two great triumphs , two things that I am proudest of . One is the economic recovery , in which the people of America created and filled 19 million new jobs . The other is the recovery of our morale . America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership . Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this . It was back in 1981 , and I was attending my first big economic summit , which was held that year in Canada . The meeting place rotates among the member countries . The opening meeting was a formal dinner of the heads of goverment of the seven industrialized nations . Now , I sat there like the new kid in school and listened , and it was all Francois this and Helmut that . They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first name basis . Well , at one point I sort of leaned in and said , My name s Ron . Well , in that same year , we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback cut taxes and regulation , started to cut spending . And soon the recovery began . Two years later , another economic summit with pretty much the same cast . At the big opening meeting we all got together , and all of a sudden , just for a moment , I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me . And then one of them broke the silence . Tell us about the American miracle , he said . Well , back in 1980 , when I was running for President , it was all so different . Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe . Our views on foreign affairs would cause war . Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse . I even remember one highly respected economist saying , back in 1982 , that The engines of economic growth have shut down here , and they are likely to stay that way for years to come . Well , he and the other opinion leaders were wrong . The fact is what they call radical was really right . What they called dangerous was just desperately needed . And in all of that time I won a nickname , The Great Communicator . But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference it was the content . I was not a great communicator , but I communicated great things , and they did not spring full bloom from my brow , they came from the heart of a great nation from our experience , our wisdom , and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries . They called it the Reagan revolution . Well , I will accept that , but for me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery , a rediscovery of our values and our common sense . Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something , the people will produce less of it . So , we cut the people s tax rates , and the people produced more than ever before . The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger . Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history real family income up , the poverty rate down , entrepreneurship booming , and an explosion in research and new technology . We are exporting more than ever because American industry because more competitive and at the same time , we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at home . Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace , we had have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion . So , we rebuilt our defenses , and this New Year we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe . Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and hope for even more progress is bright but the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease . The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone . The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan . The Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of Cambodia , and an American mediated accord will soon send 50 , 000 Cuban troops home from Angola . The lesson of all this was , of course , that because we are a great nation , our challenges seem complex . It will always be this way . But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves , the future will always be ours . And something else we learned Once you begin a great movement , there is no telling where it will end . We meant to change a nation , and instead , we changed a world . Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past . For them , the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that , lo and behold , the moral way of government is the practical way of government Democracy , the profoundly good , is also the profoundly productive . When you have got to the point when you can celebrate the anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes , review your life , and see it flowing before you . For me there was a fork in the river , and it was right in the middle of my life . I never meant to go into politics . It was not my intention when I was young . But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on you . I was happy with my career in the entertainment world , but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious . Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government , and with three little words We the People . We the People tell the government what to do it does not tell us . We the People are the driver the government is the car . And we decide where it should go , and by what route , and how fast . Almost all the world s constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are . Our Constitution is a document in which We the People tell the government what it is allowed to do . We the People are free . This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I have tried to do these past eight years . But back in the 1960s , when I began , it seemed to me that we had begun reversing the order of things that through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes , the government was taking more of our money , more of our options , and more of our freedom . I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say , Stop . I was a citizen politician , and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do . I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping . And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited . There is a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics As government expands , liberty contracts . Nothing is less free than pure Communism and yet we have , the past few years , forged a satisfying new closeness with the Soviet Union . I have been asked if this is not a gamble , and my answer is no because we are basing our actions not on words but deeds . The detente of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises . They had promise to treat their own people and the people of the world better . But the gulag was still the gulag , and the state was still expansionist , and they still waged proxy wars in Africa , Asia , and Latin America . Well , this time , so far , it is different . President Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan . He has also freed prisoners whose names I have given him every time we have met . But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents . Once , during the heady days of the Moscow summit , Nancy and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat Street that is a little street just off Moscow s main shopping area . Even though our visit was a surprise , every Russian there immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands . We were just about swept away by the warmth . You could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy . But within seconds , a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd . It was an interesting moment . It reminded me that while the man on the street in the Soviet Union yearns for peace , the government is Communist . And those who run it are Communists , and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human rights very differently . We must keep up our guard , but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust . My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders . I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them . We wish him well . And we will continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one . What it all boils down to is this I want the new closeness to continue . And it will , as long as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner . If and when they do not , at first pull your punches . If they persist , pull the plug . It is still trust but verify . It is still play , but cut the cards . It is still watch closely . And do not be afraid to see what you see . I have been asked if I have any regrets . Well , I do . The deficit is one . I have been talking a great deal about that lately , but tonight is not for arguments , and I am going to hold my tongue . But an observation I have had my share of victories in the Congress , but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you did not win for me . They never saw my troops , they never saw Reagan s regiments , the American people . You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action . Well , action is still needed . If we are to finish the job . Reagan s regiments will have to become the Bush brigades . Soon he will be the chief , and he will need you every bit as much as I did . Finally , there is a great tradition of warnings in Presidential farewells , and I have got one that is been on my mind for some time . But oddly enough it starts with one of the things I am proudest of in the past eight years the resurgence of national pride that I called the new patriotism . This national feeling is good , but it will not count for much , and it will not last unless it is grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge . An informed patriotism is what we want . And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America . We were taught , very directly , what it means to be an American . And we absorbed , almost in the air , a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions . If you did not get these things from your family you got them from the neighborhood , from the father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who lost someone at Anzio . Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school . And if all else failed you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture . The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special . TV was like that , too , through the mid 60s . But now , we are about to enter the 90s , and some things have changed . Younger parents are not sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children . And as for those who create the popular culture , well grounded patriotism is no longer the style . Our spirit is back , but we have not reinstitutionalized it . We have got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom of enterprise . And freedom is special and rare . It is fragile it needs production . So , we have got to teach history based not on what is in fashion but what is important why the Pilgrims came here , who Jimmy Doolittle was , and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant . You know , four years ago on the 40th anniversary of D Day , I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late father , who d fought on Omaha Beach . Her name was Lisa Zanatta Henn , and she said , we will always remember , we will never forget what the boys of Normandy did . Well , let us help her keep her word . If we forget what we did , we will not know who we are . I am warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result , ultimately , in an erosion of the American spirit . Let us start with some basics more attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual . And let me offer lesson number one about America All great change in America begins at the dinner table . So , tomorrow night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins . And children , if your parents have not been teaching you what it means to be an American , let em know and nail em on it . That would be a very American thing to do . And that is about all I have to say tonight , except for one thing . The past few days when I have been at that window upstairs , I have thought a bit of the shining city upon a hill . The phrase comes from John Winthrop , who wrote it to describe the America he imagined . What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim , an early freedom man . He journeyed here on what today we had call a little wooden boat and like the other Pilgrims , he was looking for a home that would be free . I have spoken of the shining city all my political life , but I do not know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it . But in my mind it was a tall , proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans , windswept , God blessed , and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity . And if there had to be city walls , the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here . That is how I saw it , and see it still . And how stands the city on this winter night More prosperous , more secure , and happier than it was eight years ago . But more than that After 200 years , two centuries , she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge , and her glow has held steady no matter what storm . And she is still a beacon , still a magnet for all who must have freedom , for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness , toward home . We have done our part . And as I walk off into the city streets , a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution , the men and women across America who for eight years did the work that brought America back . My friends We did it . We were not just marking time . We made a difference . We made the city stronger , we made the city freer , and we left her in good hands . All in all , not bad , not bad at all . And so , goodbye , God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , distinguished Members of the Congress , honored guests , and fellow citizens I have no words to express my appreciation for that greeting . I have come to speak to you tonight about our economic recovery program and why I believe it is essential that the Congress approve this package , which I believe will lift the crushing burden of inflation off of our citizens and restore the vitality to our economy and our industrial machine . First , however , and due to events of the past few weeks , will you permit me to digress for a moment from the all important subject of why we must bring government spending under control and reduce tax rates . I had like to say a few words directly to all of you and to those who are watching and listening tonight , because this is the only way I know to express to all of you on behalf of Nancy and myself our appreciation for your messages and flowers and , most of all , your prayers , not only for me but for those others who fell beside me . The warmth of your words , the expression of friendship and , yes , love , meant more to us than you can ever know . You have given us a memory that we will treasure forever . And you have provided an answer to those few voices that were raised saying that what happened was evidence that ours is a sick society . The society we heard from is made up of millions of compassionate Americans and their children , from college age to kindergarten . As a matter of fact , as evidence of that I have a letter with me . The letter came from Peter Sweeney . He is in the second grade in the Riverside School in Rockville Centre , and he said , I hope you get well quick or you might have to make a speech in your pajamas . He added a postscript . If you have to make a speech in your pajamas , I warned you . Well , sick societies do not produce men like the two who recently returned from outer space . Sick societies do not produce young men like Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy , who placed his body between mine and the man with the gun simply because he felt that is what his duty called for him to do . Sick societies do not produce dedicated police officers like Tom Delahanty or able and devoted public servants like Jim Brady . Sick societies do not make people like us so proud to be Americans and so very proud of our fellow citizens . Now , let us talk about getting spending and inflation under control and cutting your tax rates . Speaker and Senator Baker , I want to thank you for your cooperation in helping to arrange this joint session of the Congress . I will not be speaking to you very long tonight , but I asked for this meeting because the urgency of our joint mission has not changed . Thanks to some very fine people , my health is much improved . I had like to be able to say that with regard to the health of the economy . It is been half a year since the election that charged all of us in this Government with the task of restoring our economy . Where have we come in this 6 months Inflation , as measured by the Consumer Price Index , has continued at a double digit rate . Mortgage interest rates have averaged almost 15 percent for these 6 months , preventing families across America from buying homes . There are still almost 8 million unemployed . The average worker s hourly earnings after adjusting for inflation are lower today than they were 6 months ago , and there have been over 6 , 000 business failures . Six months is long enough . The American people now want us to act and not in half measures . They demand and they have earned a full and comprehensive effort to clean up our economic mess . Because of the extent of our economy s sickness , we know that the cure will not come quickly and that even with our package , progress will come in inches and feet , not in miles . But to fail to act will delay even longer and more painfully the cure which must come . And that cure begins with the Federal budget . And the budgetary actions taken by the Congress over the next few days will determine how we respond to the message of last November 4th . That message was very simple . Our government is too big , and it spends too much . For the last few months , you and I have enjoyed a relationship based on extraordinary cooperation . Because of this cooperation we have come a long distance in less than 3 months . I want to thank the leadership of the Congress for helping in setting a fair timetable for consideration of our recommendations . And committee chairmen on both sides of the aisle have called prompt and thorough hearings . We have also communicated in a spirit of candor , openness , and mutual respect . Tonight , as our decision day nears and as the House of Representatives weighs its alternatives , I wish to address you in that same spirit . The Senate Budget Committee , under the leadership of Pete Domenici , has just today voted out a budget resolution supported by Democrats and Republicans alike that is in all major respects consistent with the program that we have proposed . Now we look forward to favorable action on the Senate floor , but an equally crucial test involves the House of Representatives . The House will soon be choosing between two different versions or measures to deal with the economy . One is the measure offered by the House Budget Committee . The other is a bipartisan measure , a substitute introduced by Congressmen Phil Gramm of Texas and Del Latta of Ohio . On behalf of the administration , let me say that we embrace and fully support that bipartisan substitute . It will achieve all the essential aims of controlling government spending , reducing the tax burden , building a national defense second to none , and stimulating economic growth and creating millions of new jobs . At the same time , however , I must state our opposition to the measure offered by the House Budget Committee . It may appear that we have two alternatives . In reality , however , there are no more alternatives left . The committee measure quite simply falls far too short of the essential actions that we must take . For example , in the next 3 years , the committee measure projects spending 141 billion more than does the bipartisan substitute . It regrettably cuts over 14 billion in essential defense spending , funding required to restore America s national security . It adheres to the failed policy of trying to balance the budget on the taxpayer s back . It would increase tax payments by over a third , adding up to a staggering quarter of a trillion dollars . Federal taxes would increase 12 percent each year . Taxpayers would be paying a larger share of their income to government in 1984 than they do at present . In short , that measure reflects an echo of the past rather than a benchmark for the future . High taxes and excess spending growth created our present economic mess more of the same will not cure the hardship , anxiety , and discouragement it has imposed on the American people . Let us cut through the fog for a moment . The answer to a government that is too big is to stop feeding its growth . Government spending has been growing faster than the economy itself . The massive national debt which we accumulated is the result of the government s high spending diet . Well , it is time to change the diet and to change it in the right way . I know the tax portion of our package is of concern to some of you . Let me make a few points that I feel have been overlooked . First of all , it should be looked at as an integral part of the entire package , not something separate and apart from the budget reductions , the regulatory relief , and the monetary restraints . Probably the most common misconception is that we are proposing to reduce Government revenues to less than what the Government has been receiving . This is not true . Actually , the discussion has to do with how much of a tax increase should be imposed on the taxpayer in 1982 . Now , I know that over the recess in some informal polling some of your constituents have been asked which they had rather have , a balanced budget or a tax cut , and with the common sense that characterizes the people of this country , the answer , of course , has been a balanced budget . But may I suggest , with no inference that there was wrong intent on the part of those who asked the question , the question was inappropriate to the situation . Our choice is not between a balanced budget and a tax cut . Properly asked , the question is , Do you want a great big raise in your taxes this coming year or , at the worst , a very little increase with the prospect of tax reduction and a balanced budget down the road a ways With the common sense that the people have already shown , I am sure we all know what the answer to that question would be . A gigantic tax increase has been built into the system . We propose nothing more than a reduction of that increase . The people have a right to know that even with our plan they will be paying more in taxes , but not as much more as they will without it . The option , I believe , offered by the House Budget Committee , will leave spending too high and tax rates too high . At the same time , I think it cuts the defense budget too much , and by attempting to reduce the deficit through higher taxes , it will not create the kind of strong economic growth and the new jobs that we must have . Let us not overlook the fact that the small , independent business man or woman creates more than 80 percent of all the new jobs and employs more than half of our total work force . Our across the board cut in tax rates for a 3 year period will give them much of the incentive and promise of stability they need to go forward with expansion plans calling for additional employees . Tonight , I renew my call for us to work as a team , to join in cooperation so that we find answers which will begin to solve all our economic problems and not just some of them . The economic recovery package that I have outlined to you over the past weeks is , I deeply believe , the only answer that we have left . Reducing the growth of spending , cutting marginal tax rates , providing relief from overregulation , and following a noninflationary and predictable monetary policy are interwoven measures which will ensure that we have addressed each of the severe dislocations which threaten our economic future . These policies will make our economy stronger , and the stronger economy will balance the budget which we are committed to do by 1984 . When I took the oath of office , I pledged loyalty to only one special interest group We the people . Those people neighbors and friends , shopkeepers and laborers , farmers and craftsmen do not have infinite patience . As a matter fact , some 80 years ago , Teddy Roosevelt wrote these instructive words in his first message to the Congress The American people are slow to wrath , but when their wrath is once kindled , it burns like a consuming flame . Well , perhaps that kind of wrath will be deserved if our answer to these serious problems is to repeat the mistakes of the past . The old and comfortable way is to shave a little here and add a little there . Well , that is not acceptable anymore . I think this great and historic Congress knows that way is no longer acceptable . Thank you very much . I think you have shown that you know the one sure way to continue the inflationary spiral is to fall back into the predictable patterns of old economic practices . Is not it time that we tried something new When you allowed me to speak to you here in these chambers a little earlier , I told you that I wanted this program for economic recovery to be ours yours and mine . I think the bipartisan substitute bill has achieved that purpose . It moves us toward economic vitality . Justtwo weeks ago , you and I joined millions of our fellow Americans in marveling at the magic historical moment that John Young and Bob Crippen created in their space shuttle , Columbia . The last manned effort was almost 6 years ago , and I remembered on this more recent day , over the years , how we had all come to expect technological precision of our men and machines . And each amazing achievement became commonplace , until the next new challenge was raised . With the space shuttle we tested our ingenuity once again , moving beyond the accomplishments of the past into the promise and uncertainty of the future . Thus , we not only planned to send up a 122 foot aircraft 170 miles into space , but we also intended to make it maneuverable and return it to Earth , landing 98 tons of exotic metals delicately on a remote , dry lake bed . The space shuttle did more than prove our technological abilities . It raised our expectations once more . It started us dreaming again . The poet Carl Sandburg wrote , The republic is a dream . Nothing happens unless first a dream . And that is what makes us , as Americans , different . We have always reached for a new spirit and aimed at a higher goal . We have been courageous and determined , unafraid and bold . Who among us wants to be first to say we no longer have those qualities , that we must limp along , doing the same things that have brought us our present misery I believe that the people you and I represent are ready to chart a new course . They look to us to meet the great challenge , to reach beyond the commonplace and not fall short for lack of creativity or courage . Someone you know has said that he who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers . Well , we have much greatness before us . We can restore our economic strength and build opportunities like none we have ever had before . As Carl Sandburg said , all we need to begin with is a dream that we can do better than before . All we need to have is faith , and that dream will come true . All we need to do is act , and the time for action is now . Thank you . Good night .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans At 7 of the clock this evening eastern time , air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against the headquarters , terrorist facilities , and military assets that support Mu ammar Qadhafi s subversive activities . The attacks were concentrated and carefully targeted to minimize casualties among the Libyan people with whom we have no quarrel . From initial reports , our forces have succeeded in their mission . Several weeks ago in New Orleans , I warned Colonel Qadhafi we would hold his regime accountable for any new terrorist attacks launched against American citizens . More recently I made it clear we would respond as soon as we determined conclusively who was responsible for such attacks . On April 5th in West Berlin a terrorist bomb exploded in a nightclub frequented by American servicemen . Sergeant Kenneth Ford and a young Turkish woman were killed and 230 others were wounded , among them some 50 American military personnel . This monstrous brutality is but the latest act in Colonel Qadhafi s reign of terror . The evidence is now conclusive that the terrorist bombing of La Belle discotheque was planned and executed under the direct orders of the Libyan regime . On March 25th , more than a week before the attack , orders were sent from Tripoli to the Libyan People s Bureau in East Berlin to conduct a terrorist attack against Americans to cause maximum and indiscriminate casualties . Libya s agents then planted the bomb . On April 4th the People s Bureau alerted Tripoli that the attack would be carried out the following morning . The next day they reported back to Tripoli on the great success of their mission . Our evidence is direct it is precise it is irrefutable . We have solid evidence about other attacks Qadhafi has planned against the United States installations and diplomats and even American tourists . Thanks to close cooperation with our friends , some of these have been prevented . With the help of French authorities , we recently aborted one such attack a planned massacre , using grenades and small arms , of civilians waiting in line for visas at an American Embassy . Colonel Qadhafi is not only an enemy of the United States . His record of subversion and aggression against the neighboring states in Africa is well documented and well known . He has ordered the murder of fellow Libyans in countless countries . He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa , Europe , and the Middle East , as well as the Western Hemisphere . Today we have done what we had to do . If necessary , we shall do it again . It gives me no pleasure to say that , and I wish it were otherwise . Before Qadhafi seized power in 1969 , the people of Libya had been friends of the United States . And I am sure that today most Libyans are ashamed and disgusted that this man has made their country a synonym for barbarism around the world . The Libyan people are a decent people caught in the grip of a tyrant . To our friends and allies in Europe who cooperated in today s mission , I would only say you have the permanent gratitude of the American people . Europeans who remember history understand better than most that there is no security , no safety , in the appeasement of evil . It must be the core of Western policy that there be no sanctuary for terror . And to sustain such a policy , free men and free nations must unite and work together . Sometimes it is said that by imposing sanctions against Colonel Qadhafi or by striking at his terrorist installations we only magnify the man s importance , that the proper way to deal with him is to ignore him . I do not agree . Long before I came into this office , Colonel Qadhafi had engaged in acts of international terror , acts that put him outside the company of civilized men . For years , however , he suffered no economic or political or military sanction and the atrocities mounted in number , as did the innocent dead and wounded . And for us to ignore by inaction the slaughter of American civilians and American soldiers , whether in nightclubs or airline terminals , is simply not in the American tradition . When our citizens are abused or attacked anywhere in the world on the direct orders of a hostile regime , we will respond so long as I am in this Oval Office . Self defense is not only our right , it is our duty . It is the purpose behind the mission undertaken tonight , a mission fully consistent with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter . We believe that this preemptive action against his terrorist installations will not only diminish Colonel Qadhafi s capacity to export terror , it will provide him with incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior . I have no illusion that tonight s action will ring down the curtain on Qadhafi s reign of terror . But this mission , violent though it was , can bring closer a safer and more secure world for decent men and women . We will persevere . This afternoon we consulted with the leaders of Congress regarding what we were about to do and why . Tonight I salute the skill and professionalism of the men and women of our Armed Forces who carried out this mission . It is an honor to be your Commander in Chief . We Americans are slow to anger . We always seek peaceful avenues before resorting to the use of force and we did . We tried quiet diplomacy , public condemnation , economic sanctions , and demonstrations of military force . None succeeded . Despite our repeated warnings , Qadhafi continued his reckless policy of intimidation , his relentless pursuit of terror . He counted on America to be passive . He counted wrong . I warned that there should be no place on Earth where terrorists can rest and train and practice their deadly skills . I meant it . I said that we would act with others , if possible , and alone if necessary to ensure that terrorists have no sanctuary anywhere . Tonight , we have . Thank you , and God bless you .<speech_sep>President , Chancellor Schmidt , members of the Bundestag , distinguished guests Perhaps because I have just come from London , I have this urge to quote the great Johnson who said , The feeling of friendship is like that of being comfortably filled with roast beef . Well , I feel very much filled with friendship this afternoon , and I bring you the warmest regards and goodwill of the American people . I am very honored to speak to you today and , thus , to all the people of Germany . Next year , we will jointly celebrate the 300th anniversary of the first German settlement in the American Colonies . The 13 families who came to our new land were the forerunners of more than 7 million German immigrants to the United States . Today , more Americans claim German ancestry than any other . These Germans cleared and cultivated our land , built our industries , and advanced our arts and sciences . In honor of 300 years of German contributions in America , President Carstens and I have agreed today that he will pay an official visit to the United States in October of 1983 to celebrate the occasion . The German people have given us so much , we like to think that we have repaid some of that debt . Our American Revolution was the first revolution in modern history to be fought for the right of self government and the guarantee of civil liberties . That spirit was contagious . In 1849 , the Frankfurt Parliament s statement of basic human rights guaranteed freedom of expression , freedom of religion , and equality before the law . And these principles live today in the basic law of the Federal Republic . Many peoples to the east still wait for such rights . The United States is proud of your democracy , but we cannot take credit for it . Heinrich Heine , in speaking of those who built the awe inspiring cathedrals of medieval times , said that , In those days people had convictions . We moderns have only opinions , and it requires something more than opinions , he said , to build a Gothic cathedral . Well , over the past 30 years , the convictions of the German people have built a cathedral of democracy a great and glorious testament to your ideals . We in America genuinely admire the free society that you have built in only a few decades , and we understand all the better what you have accomplished because of our own history . Americans speak with the deepest reverence of those Founding Fathers and first citizens who gave us the freedom that we enjoy today . And even though they lived over 200 years ago , we carry them in our hearts as well as in our history books . I believe future generations of Germans will look to you here today and to your fellow Germans with the same profound respect and appreciation . You have built a free society with an abiding faith in human dignity the crowning ideal of Western civilization . This will not be forgotten . You will be saluted and honored by this Republic s descendants over the centuries to come . Yesterday , before the British Parliament , I spoke of the values of Western civilization and the necessity to help all peoples gain the institutions of freedom . In many ways , in many places , our ideals are being tested today . We are meeting this afternoon between two important summits the gathering of leading industrial democracies at Versailles and the assembly of the Atlantic Alliance here in Bonn tomorrow . Critical and complex problems face us , but our dilemmas will be made easier if we remember our partnership is based on a common Western heritage and a faith in democracy . I believe this partnership of the Atlantic Alliance nations is motivated primarily by the search for peace inner peace for our citizens and peace among nations . Why inner peace Because democracy allows for self expression . It respects man s dignity and creativity . It operates by a rule of law , not by terror or coercion . It is government with the consent of the governed . As a result , citizens of the Atlantic Alliance enjoy an unprecedented level of material and spiritual well being , and they are free to find their own personal peace . We also seek peace among nations . The Psalmist said , Seek peace and pursue it . Well , our foreign policies are based on this principle and directed toward this end . The noblest objective of our diplomacy is the patient and difficult task of reconciling our adversaries to peace . And I know we all look forward to the day when the only industry of man 1 will be the research of historians . But the simple hope for peace is not enough . We must remember something that Friedrich Schiller said The most pious man cannot stay in peace if it does not please his evil neighbor . So , there must be a method to our search , a method that recognizes the dangers and realities of the world . During Chancellor Schmidt s state visit to Washington last year , I said that your Republic was perched on a cliff of freedom . I was not saying anything the German people do not already know . Living as you do in the heart of a divided Europe , you can see more clearly than others that there are governments at peace neither with their own peoples nor the world . I do not believe any reasonable observer can deny that there is a threat to both peace and freedom today . It is as stark as that gash of a border that separates the German people . We are menaced by a power that openly condemns our values and answers our restraint with a relentless military buildup . We cannot simply assume every nation wants the peace that we so earnestly desire . The Polish people would tell us there are those who would use military force to repress others who want only basic human rights . The freedom fighters of Afghanistan would tell us as well that the threat of aggression has not receded from the world . Without a strengthened Atlantic security , the possibility of military coercion will be very great . We must continue to improve our defenses if we are to preserve peace and freedom . This is . . . Is there an echo in here But this preserving peace and freedom is not an impossible task . For almost 40 years , we have succeeded in deterring war . Our method has been to organize our defensive capabilities , both nuclear and conventional , so that an aggressor could have no hope of military victory . The Alliance has carried its strength not as a battle flag , but as a banner of peace . Deterrence has kept that peace , and we must continue to take the steps necessary to make deterrence credible , This depends in part on a strong America . A national effort , entailing sacrifices by the American people , is now underway to make long overdue improvements in our military posture . The American people support this effort because they understand how fundamental it is to keeping the peace they so fervently desire . We also are resolved to maintain the presence of well equipped and trained forces in Europe , and our strategic forces will be modernized and remain committed to the Alliance . By these actions , the people of the United States are saying , We are with you Germany you are not alone . Our adversaries would be foolishly mistaken should they gamble that Americans would abandon their Alliance responsibilities , no matter how severe the test . Alliance security depends on a fully credible conventional defense to which all allies contribute . There is a danger that any conflict could escalate to a nuclear war . Strong conventional forces can make the danger of conventional or nuclear conflict more remote . Reasonable strength in and of itself is not bad it is honorable when used to maintain peace or defend deeply held beliefs . One of the first chores is to fulfill our commitments to each other by continuing to strengthen our conventional defenses . This must include improving the readiness of our standing forces and the ability of those forces to operate as one . We must also apply the West s technological genius to improving our conventional deterrence . There can be no doubt that we as an Alliance have the means to improve our conventional defenses . Our peoples hold values of individual liberty and dignity that time and again they have proven willing to defend . Our economic energy vastly exceeds that of our adversaries . Our free system has produced technological advances that other systems , with their stifling ideologies , cannot hope to equal . All of these resources are available to our defense . Yes , many of our nations currently are experiencing economic difficulties yet we must nevertheless guarantee that our security does not suffer as a result . We have made strides in conventional defense over the last few years despite our economic problems , and we have disproved the pessimists who contend that our efforts are futile . The more we close the conventional gap , the less the risks of aggression or nuclear conflict . The soil of Germany and of every other Ally is of vital concern to each member of the Alliance . And this fundamental commitment is embodied in the North Atlantic Treaty . But it will be an empty pledge unless we ensure that American forces are ready to reinforce Europe , and Europe is ready to receive them . I am encouraged by the recent agreement on wartime host nation support . This pact strengthens our ability to deter aggression in Europe and demonstrates our common determination to respond to attack . Just as each ally shares fully in the security of the Alliance , each is responsible for shouldering a fair share of the burden . Now that , of course , often leads to a difference of opinion , and criticism of our Alliance is as old as the partnership itself . But voices have now been raised on both sides of the Atlantic that mistake the inevitable process of adjustment within the Alliance for a dramatic divergence of interests . Some Americans think that Europeans are too little concerned for their own security . Some would unilaterally reduce the number of American troops deployed in Europe . And in Europe itself , we hear the idea that the American presence , rather than contributing to peace , either has no deterrent value or actually increases the risk that our Allies may be attacked . These arguments ignore both the history and the reality of the transatlantic coalition . Let me assure you that the American commitment to Europe remains steady and strong . Europe s shores are our shores . Europe s borders are our borders . And we will stand with you in defense of our heritage of liberty and dignity . The American people recognize Europe s substantial contributions to our joint security . Nowhere is that contribution more evident than here in the Federal Republic . German citizens host the forces of six nations . German soldiers and reservists provide the backbone of NATO s conventional deterrent in the heartland of Europe . Your Bundeswehr is a model for the integration of defense needs with a democratic way of life , and you have not shrunk from the heavy responsibility of accepting the nuclear forces necessary for deterrence . I ask your help in fulfilling another responsibility . Many American citizens do not believe that their counterparts in Europe , especially younger citizens , really understand the United States presence there . Now , if you will work toward explaining the role to people on this side of the Atlantic , I will explain it to those on the other side . In recent months , both in your country and mine , there has been renewed public concern about the threat of nuclear war and the arms buildup . I know it is not easy , especially for the German people , to live in the gale of intimidation that blows from the east . If I might quote Heine again , he almost foretold the fears of nuclear war when he wrote , Wild , dark times are rumbling toward us , and the prophet who wishes to write a new apocalypse will have to invent entirely new beasts , and beasts so terrible that the ancient animal symbols will seem like cooing doves and cupids in comparison . The nuclear threat is a terrible beast . Perhaps the banner carried in one of the nuclear demonstrations here in Germany said it best . The sign read , I am afraid . Well , I know of no Western leader who does not sympathize with that earnest plea . To those who march for peace , my heart is with you . I would be at the head of your parade if I believed marching alone could bring about a more secure world . And to the 2 , 800 women in Filderstadt who spent a petition for peace to President Brezhnev and me , let me say myself , would sign your petition if I thought it could bring about harmony . I understand your genuine concerns . The women of Filderstadt and I share the same goal . The question is how to proceed . We must think through the consequences of how we reduce the dangers to peace . Those who advocate that we unilaterally forego the modernization of our forces must prove that this will enhance our security and lead to moderation by the other side in short , that it will advance , rather than undermine , the preservation of the peace . The weight of recent history does not support this notion . Those who demand that we renounce the use of a crucial element of our deterrent strategy must show how this would decrease the likelihood of war . It is only by Comparison with a nuclear war that the suffering caused by conventional war seems a lesser evil . Our goal must be to deter war of any kind . And those who decry the failure of arms control efforts to achieve substantial results must consider where the fault lies . I would remind them that it is the United States that has proposed to ban land based intermediate range nuclear missiles the missiles most threatening to Europe . It is the United States that has proposed and will pursue deep cuts in strategic systems . It is the West that has long sought the detailed exchanges of information on forces and effective verification procedures . And it is dictatorships , not democracies , that need militarism to control their own people and impose their system on others . To those who have taken a different viewpoint and who cannot see this danger , I do not suggest that they are ignorant , it is just that they know so many things that are not true . We in the West Germans , Americans , our other Allies are deeply committed to continuing efforts to restrict the arms competition . Common sense demands that we persevere . I invite those who genuinely seek effective and lasting arms control to stand behind the far reaching proposals that we have put forward . In return , I pledge that we will sustain the closest of consultations with our Allies . On November 18th , I outlined a broad and ambitious arms control program . One element calls for reducing land based intermediate range nuclear missiles to zero on each side . If carried out , it would eliminate the growing threat to Western Europe posed by the S . R . s modern SS 20 rockets , and it would make unnecessary the NATO decision to deploy American intermediate range systems . And , by the way , I cannot understand why among some , there is a greater fear of weapons NATO is to deploy than of weapons the Soviet Union already has deployed . Our proposal is fair because it imposes equal limits and obligations on both sides , and it calls for significant reductions , not merely a capping of an existing high level of destructive power . As you know , we have made this proposal in Geneva , where negotiations have been underway since the end of November last year . We intend to pursue those negotiations intensively . I regard them as a significant test of the Soviets willingness to enter into meaningful arms control agreements . On May 9th , we proposed to the Soviet Union that Strategic Arms Reductions Talks begin this month in Geneva . The S . has agreed , and talks will begin on June 29th . We in the United States want to focus on the most destabilizing systems , and thus reduce the risk of war . And that is why in the first phase , we propose to reduce substantially the number of ballistic missile warheads and the missiles themselves . In the second phase , we will seek an equal ceiling on other elements of our strategic forces , including ballistic missile throwweight , at less than current American levels . We will handle cruise missiles and bombers in an equitable fashion . We will negotiate in good faith and undertake these talks with the same seriousness of purpose that has marked our preparations over the last several months . Another element of the program I outlined was a call for reductions in conventional forces in Europe . From the earliest postwar years , the Western democracies have faced the ominous reality that massive Soviet conventional forces would remain stationed where they do not belong . The muscle of Soviet forces in Central Europe far exceeds legitimate defense needs . Their presence is made more threatening still by a military doctrine that emphasizes mobility and surprise attack . And as history shows , these troops have built a legacy of intimidation and repression . In response , the NATO allies must show they have the will and capacity to deter any conventional attack or any attempt to intimidate us . Yet , we also will continue the search for responsible ways to reduce NATO and Warsaw Pact military personnel to equal levels . In recent weeks , we in the Alliance have consulted on how best to invigorate the Vienna negotiations on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions . Based on these consultations , Western representatives in the Vienna talks soon will make a proposal by which the two alliances would reduce their respective ground force personnel in verifiable stages to a total of 700 , 000 men and their combined ground and air force personnel to a level of 900 , 000 men . While the agreement would not eliminate the threat nor spare our citizens the task of maintaining a substantial defense force , it could constitute a major step toward a safer Europe for both East and West . It could lead to military stability at lower levels and lessen the dangers of miscalculation and a surprise attack , and it also would demonstrate the political will of the two alliances to enhance stability by limiting their forces in the central area of their military competition . The West has established a clear set of goals . We , as an Alliance , will press forward with plans to improve our own conventional forces in Europe . At the same time , we propose an arms control agreement to equalize conventional forces at a significantly lower level . We will move ahead with our preparations to modernize our nuclear forces in Europe . But , again , we also will work unceasingly to gain acceptance in Geneva of our proposal to ban land based , intermediate range nuclear missiles . In the United States , we will move forward with the plans I announced last year to modernize our strategic nuclear forces , which play so vital a role in maintaining peace by deterring war . Yet , we also have proposed that Strategic Arms Reductions Talks begin . We will pursue them determinedly . In each of these areas , our policies are based on the conviction that a stable military balance at the lowest possible level will help further the cause of peace . The other side will respond in good faith to these initiatives only if it believes we are resolved to provide for our own defense . Unless convinced that we will unite and stay united behind these arms control initiatives and modernization programs , our adversaries will seek to divide us from one another and our people from their leaders . I am optimistic about our relationship with the Soviet Union if the Western nations remain true to their values and true to each other . I believe in Western civilization and its moral power . I believe deeply in the principles the West esteems . And guided by these ideals , I believe we can find a no nonsense , workable , and lasting policy that will keep the peace . Earlier , I said the German people had built a remarkable cathedral of democracy . But we still have other work ahead . We must build a cathedral of peace , where nations are safe from war and where people need not fear for their liberties . I have heard the history of the famous cathedral of Cologne how those beautiful soaring spires miraculously survived the destruction all around them , including part of the church itself . Let us build a cathedral as the people of Cologne built theirs with the deepest commitment and determination . Let us build as they did not just for ourselves but for the generations beyond . For if we construct our peace properly , it will endure as long as the spires of Cologne . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Madam Chairman , delegates to the convention , and fellow citizens Thank you for that warm and generous welcome . Nancy and I have been enjoying the finest of Southern hospitality since we arrived here yesterday . And believe me , after that reception I do not think the Big Easy has ever been bigger than it has tonight . And with all due respect to Cajun cuisine cooking and New Orleans jazz , nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in this hall , except maybe a victory celebration on November 8th . In that spirit , I think we can be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back for having made Republican a proud word once again and America a proud nation again . Nancy and I are so honored to be your guests tonight , to share a little of your special time , and we thank you . Now I want to invoke executive privilege to talk for a moment about a very special lady who has been selfless not just for our party but for the entire Nation . She is a strong , courageous , compassionate woman and wherever she is gone , here in the United States as well as abroad , whether with young or old , whether comforting the grieving or supporting the youngsters who are fighting the scourge of drugs , she makes us proud . I have been proud of her for a long time , but never more so than in these last 8 years . With your tribute to Nancy today , you warmed my heart as well as hers , and believe me , she deserves your tribute . And I am deeply grateful to you for what you have done . When people tell me that I became President on January 20th , 1981 , I feel I have to correct them . You do not become President of the United States . You are given temporary custody of an institution called the Presidency , which belongs to our people . Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure . That trust began with many of you in this room many conventions ago . Many s the time that I have said a prayer of thanks to all Americans who placed this trust in my hands . And tonight , please accept again our heartfelt gratitude , Nancy s and mine , for this special time that you have given in our lives . Just a moment ago , you multiplied the honor with a moving tribute , and being only human , there is a part of me that would like to take credit for what we have achieved . But tonight , before we do anything else , let us remember that tribute really belongs to the 245 million citizens who make up the greatest and the first three words in our Constitution We the People . It is the American people who endured the great challenge of lifting us from the depths of national calamity , renewing our mighty economic strength , and leading the way to restoring our respect in the world . They are an extraordinary breed we call Americans . So , if there is any salute deserved tonight , it is to the heroes everywhere in this land who make up the doers , the dreamers , and the lifebuilders without which our glorious experiment in democracy would have failed . This convention brings back so many memories to a fellow like me . I can still remember my first Republican convention Abraham Lincoln giving a speech that sent tingles down my spine . No , I have to confess , I was not actually there . The truth is , way back then , I belonged to the other party . But surely we can remember another convention . Eight years ago , we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time for our beloved country . And we gathered solemnly to share our dreams . When I look back , I wonder if we dared be so bold to take on those burdens . But in that same city of Detroit , when the 20th century was only in its second year , another great Republican , Teddy Roosevelt , told Americans not to hold back from dangers ahead but to rejoice Our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and to our children it shall be given to make this Republic the mightiest among the peoples of mankind . Teddy said those , years ago . In 1980 we needed every bit of that kind of faith . That year , it was our dream that together we could rescue America and make a new beginning , to create anew that shining city on a hill . The dream we shared was to reclaim our government , to transform it from one that was consuming our prosperity into one that would get out of the way of those who created prosperity . It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny . We made a determination that our dream would not be built on a foundation of sand something called Trust Me Government but we would trust , instead , the American spirit . And , yes , we were unashamed in believing that this dream was driven by a community of shared values of family , work , neighborhood , peace , and freedom . And on the night of July 17th , 1980 , we left with a mutual pledge to conduct a national crusade to make America great again . We had faith because the heroes in our midst had never failed us before . Tom Paine knew what these Americans with character of steel could do when he wrote The harder the conflict , the more glorious the triumph . And my fellow citizens , while our triumph is not yet complete , the road has been glorious indeed . Eight years ago , we met at a time when America was in economic chaos , and today we meet in a time of economic promise . We met then in international distress and today with global hope . Now , I think we can be forgiven if we engage in a little review of that history tonight as the saying goes , just a friendly reminder . I have been doing a little remembering of my own because of all that inflated rhetoric by our friends in Atlanta last month . But then , inflation is their specialty . Before we came to Washington , Americans had just suffered the two worst back to back years of inflation in 60 years . Those are the facts , and as John Adams said , Facts are stubborn things . Interest rates had jumped to over 21 percent , the highest in 120 years , more than doubling the average monthly mortgage payments for working families our families . When they sat around the kitchen table , it was not to plan summer vacations , it was to plan economic survival . Facts are stubborn things . Industrial production was down , and productivity was down for 2 consecutive years . The average weekly you missed me . The average weekly wage plunged 9 percent . The median family income fell 51 2 percent . Facts are stubborn things . Our friends on the other side had actually passed the single highest tax bill in the 200 year history of the United States . Auto loans , because of their policies , went up to 17 percent , so our great factories began shutting down . Fuel costs jumped through the atmosphere , more than doubling . Then people waited in gas lines as well as unemployment lines . Facts are stupid things stubborn things , I should say . And then there was the misery index . That was an election year gimmick they designed for the 1976 campaign . They added the unemployment and inflation rates . And it came to 13 . 4 percent in 1976 , and they declared that our candidate , Jerry Ford , had no right to seek re election with that kind of misery index . But 4 years later , in the 1980 campaign , they did not mention the misery index . Do you suppose it was because it was no longer 13 . 4 percent In those 4 years it had become almost 21 percent . And last month , in Atlanta at their convention , there was again no mention of the misery index . Why Because right now it is less than 9 . 2 percent . Facts are stubborn things . When we met in Detroit in that summer of 1980 , it was a summer of discontent for America around the world . Our national defense had been so weakened , the Soviet Union had begun to engage in reckless aggression , including the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan . The response to that was to forbid our athletes to participate in the 1980 Olympics and to try to pull the rug out from under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo . And in those years , on any given day , we had military aircraft that could not fly for lack of spare parts and ships that could not leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew . Our Embassy in Pakistan was burned to the ground , and the one in Iran was stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as hostages . The world began to question the constancy and resolve of the United States . Our leaders answered not that there was something wrong with our government but that our people were at fault because of some malaise . Well , facts are stubborn things . When our friends last month talked of unemployment , despair , hopelessness , economic weakness , I wondered why on Earth they were talking about 1978 instead of 1988 . And now we hear talk that it is time for a change . Well , ladies and gentlemen , another friendly reminder We are the change . We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981 . We focused on hope , not despair . We challenged the failed policies of the past because we believed that a society is great not because of promises made by its government but only because of progress made by its people . And that was our change . We said something shocking Taxes ought to be reduced , not raised . We cut the tax rates for the working folks of America . We indexed taxes , and that stopped a bracket creep which kicked average wage earners into higher tax brackets when they had only received a cost of living pay raise . And we initiated reform of the unfairness in our tax system . And what do you know , the top 5 percent of earners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax revenue at the lower rates than they ever had before , and millions of earners at the bottom of the scale have been freed from paying any income tax at all . That was our change . So , together we pulled out of a tailspin and created 171 2 million good jobs . That is more than a quarter of a million new jobs a month every month for 68 consecutive months . America is working again . And just since our 1984 convention , we have created over 11 million of those new jobs . Now , just why would our friends on the other side want to change that Why do they think putting you out of work is better than putting you to work New homes are being built . New car sales reached record levels . Exports are starting to climb again . Factory capacity is approaching maximum use . You know , I have noticed they do not call it Reaganomics anymore . As for inflation , well , that too has changed . We changed it from the time it hit 18 percent in 1980 down to between 3 . 5 and 4 percent . Interest rates are less than half of what they were . In fact , nearly half of all mortgages taken out on family homes in 1986 and more than a third of those in 1987 were actually old loans being refinanced at the new lower rates . Young families have finally been able to get some relief . These , too , were our changes . We rebuilt our Armed Forces . We liberated Grenada from the Communists and helped return that island to democracy . We struck a firm blow against Libyan terrorism . We have seen the growth of democracy in 90 percent of Latin America . The Soviets have begun to pull out of Afghanistan . The bloody Iran Iraq war is coming to an end . And for the first time in 8 years we have the prospects of peace in Southwest Africa and the removal of Cuban and other foreign forces from the region . And in the 2 , 765 days of our administration , not i inch of ground has fallen to the Communists . The President . Today we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of and Soviet nuclear missiles . We are working on the Strategic Defense Initiative to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror . And American and Soviet relations are the best they have ever been since World War II . And virtually all this change occurred and continues to occur in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it is time for a change . They resisted our defense buildup . They resisted our tax cuts . They resisted cutting the fat out of government . And they resisted our appointments of judges committed to the law and the Constitution . And it is time for some more straight talk . This time it is about the budget deficit . Yes , it is much too high . But the President does not vote for a budget , and the President cannot spend a dime . Only the Congress can do that . They blame the defense increases for the deficit , yet defense spending today , in real dollars , is almost exactly what it was 6 years ago . In a 6 year period , Congress cut defense spending authority by over 125 billion . And for every 1 reduction in defense outlays , they added 2 to domestic spending . Now , if they had passed my first budget , my first spending plan in 1982 , the cumulative outlays and deficits would have been 207 billion lower by 1986 . Every single year I have been in office , I have supported and called for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution , and the liberals have said no every year . I called for the line item veto , which 43 Governors have , to cut fat in the budget , and the liberals have said no . Every year I have attempted to limit their wild spending sprees , and they have said no . They would have us believe that runaway budget deficits began in 1981 when we took office . Well , let me tell you something The fact is , when they began their war on poverty in the middle sixties , from 1965 through 1980 m just those 15 years , the budgets increased to five times what they had been , and the deficits went up to 52 times what they had been before their war on poverty . Now , do not we know that if they are elected their answer will be the one they have relied on in the past , and that is higher taxes . The other party has controlled the House of Representatives for 52 out of the last 56 years . They have controlled the Senate also for 46 of those years . Where we really need a change is to elect Republican majorities in both Houses . And then George Bush can have a team that will protect your tax cuts keep America strong hold down inflation and interest rates appoint judges to preserve your rights and , yes , reduce the budget deficit . Early in the first term , we set out to reduce Federal regulations that had been imposed on the people , on businesses , and on local and State governments . Today I am proud to say that we have eliminated so many unnecessary regulations that government required paperwork imposed on citizens , businesses , and other levels of government has been reduced by an estimated 600 million man hours of paperwork a year . And George was there . No , you have not heard it all yet . George Bush headed up that task force that eliminated those regulations . In 1980 and before , it took 7 weeks to get a Social Security card . Now it takes 10 days . It only takes 10 days to get a passport . It used to take 43 days . It took 75 days to get an export license . Now it is only 17 days , and for some countries , only 5 . It took over 100 days to process a claim for a Department of Housing and Urban Development Title I loan 100 days . It now takes less than one fourth of that 22 days . I think these specifics suggest there is a new level of competent management in the Departments of our government . George played a major role in everything that we have accomplished in these 8 years . Now early on , we had a foreign policy problem . Our NATO allies were under the threat of Soviet intermediate range missiles , and NATO had no equivalent deterrent . Our effort to provide a deterrent Pershing and ground launched cruise missiles on the NATO line resulted in political problems for our NATO allies . There was objection on the part of many other people to deployment of our missiles . George represented us in Brussels with the heads of the NATO countries and they agreed , when he finished , to take the missiles . This subsequently persuaded the Soviets to sign the INF treaty and begin removing their SS 20 s . None of our achievements happened by accident , but only because we overcame liberal opposition to put our programs in place . And without George Bush to build on those policies , everything we have achieved will be at risk . All the work , sacrifice , and effort of the American people could end in the very same disaster that we inherited in 1981 . Because I feel so strongly about the work that must continue and the need to protect our gains for the American family and for national security , I want to share with you the qualities we should seek in the next President . We need someone who is big enough and experienced enough to handle tough and demanding negotiations with Gorbachev because this is no time to gamble with on the job training . We need someone who is prepared to be President and who has the commitment to stand up for you against massive new taxes and who will keep alive the hope and promise that keeps our economy strong . It will take somebody who has seen this office from the inside , who senses the danger points , will be cool under fire , and knows the range of answers when the tough questions come . Well , that is the George Bush that I have seen up close , when the staff and Cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of us are alone someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue , someone who never runs away from a fight , never backs away from his beliefs , and never makes excuses . This office is not mine to give only you , the people , can do that . But I love America too much and care too much about where we will be in the next few years . I care that we give custody of this office to someone who will build on our changes , not retreat to the past , someone who will continue the change all of us fought for . To preserve what we have and not risk losing it all , America needs George Bush and Barbara Bush as First Lady . Okay . All right . With George Bush , I will know as we approach the new millennium our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protected against aggression . We will have a prosperity that spreads the blessings of our abundance and opportunity across all America . We will have safe and active neighborhoods , drug free schools that send our children soaring in the atmosphere of great ideas and deep values , and a nation confidently willing to take its leadership into the uncharted reaches of a new age . So , George , I am in your corner . I am ready to volunteer a little advice now and then and offer a pointer or two on strategy , if asked . I will help keep the facts straight or just stand back and cheer . But , George , just one personal request Go out there and win one for the Gipper . As you can imagine , I am sorely tempted to spend the rest of this evening telling the truth about our friends who met in Atlanta , but , then , why should I have all the fun So , for the next few moments , let us talk about the future . This is the last Republican convention I will address as President . Maybe you will see your way to inviting me back sometime . But like so many of us , as I said earlier , I started out in the other party . But 40 years ago , I cast my last vote as a Democrat . It was a party in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt promised the return of power to the States . It was a party where Harry Truman committed a strong and resolute America to preserving freedom . D . had run on a platform of eliminating useless boards and commissions and returning autonomy and authority to local governments and to the States . That party changed , and it will never be the same . They left me I did not leave them . So , it was our Republican Party that gave me a political home . When I signed up for duty , I did not have to check my principles at the door . And I soon found out that the desire for victory did not overcome our devotion to ideals . And what ideals those have been . Our party speaks for human freedom , for the sweep of liberties that are at the core of our existence . We do not shirk from our duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for yearning millions . We believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and not through the good will of our adversaries . We have a healthy skepticism of government , checking its excesses at the same time we are willing to harness its energy when it helps improve the lives of our citizens . We have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no inherent right of the Federal Government . We do not think that inflation and high interest rates show compassion for the poor , the young , and the elderly . We respect the values that bind us together as families and as a nation . For our children , we do not think it is wrong to have them committed to pledging each day to the one nation , under God , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . And we have so many requirements in their classrooms why cannot we at least have one thing that is , voluntary , and that is allow our kids to repair quietly to their faith to say a prayer to start the day , as Congress does . For the unborn , quite simply , should not they be able to live to become children in those classrooms Those are some of our principles . You in this room , and millions like you watching and listening tonight , are selfless and dedicated to a better world based on these principles . You are not quitters . You walk not just precincts but for a cause . You stand for something the finest warriors for free government that I have known . Nancy and I thank you for letting us be a part of your tireless determination to leave a better world for our children . And that is why we are here , is not it A better world I know I have said this before , but I believe that God put this land between the two great oceans to be found by special people from every corner of the world who had that extra love for freedom that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world . It is our gift to have visions , and I want to share that of a young boy who wrote to me shortly after I took office . In his letter he said , I love America because you can join Cub Scouts if you want to . You have a right to worship as you please . If you have the ability , you can try to be anything you want to be . And I also like America because we have about 200 flavors of ice cream . Well , truth through the eyes of a child freedom of association , freedom of worship , freedom of hope and opportunity , and the pursuit of happiness in this case , choosing among 200 flavors of ice cream that is America , everyone with his or her vision of the American promise . That is why we are a magnet for the world for those who dodged bullets and gave their lives coming over the Berlin Wall and others , only a few of whom avoided death , coming in tiny boats on turbulent oceans . This land , its people , the dreams that unfold here and the freedom to bring it all together well , those are what make America soar , up where you can see hope billowing in those freedom winds . When our children turn the pages of our lives , I hope they will see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect as we could , where there is decency , tolerance , generosity , honesty , courage , common sense , fairness , and piety . This is my vision , and I am grateful to God for blessing me with a good life and a long one . But when I pack up my bags in Washington , do not expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life . Twilight Twilight Not in America . Here , it is a sunrise every day fresh new opportunities , dreams to build . Twilight That is not possible , because I confess there are times when I feel like I am still little Dutch Reagan racing my brother down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over the Rock River . You see , there is no sweeter day than each new one , because here in our country it means something wonderful can happen to you . And something wonderful happened to me . We lit a prairie fire a few years back . Those flames were fed by passionate ideas and convictions , and we were determined to make them run all burn , I should say , all across America . And what times we have had Together we have fought for causes we love . But we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight , because the battle is never over . Our freedom must be defended over and over again and then again . There is still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch , fences that need repair , and horses to ride . But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim , I will leave my phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot soldier . Just let me know , and I will be there , as long as words do not leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be special during its shining moment on Earth . Twilight , you say Listen to Wells . Wells says The past is but the beginning of a beginning , and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn . Well , that is a new day our sunlit new day to keep alive the fire so that when we look back at the time of choosing , we can say that we did all that could be done never less . Thank you . Good night . God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>I have a plan not a secret plan . As a matter of fact , it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981 . It is true that earlier , working with some very prominent economists , I had come up , during the campaign , with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us the double digit inflation , the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy , the stagflation that we were undergoing . Before even the election day , something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened , that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget no , that was no longer possible . So , the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy , recovery without inflation , and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product , which has become a drag on the economy . Already , we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion . Under that , this year , we have seen a 21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year , based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates . Our tax cut , we think , was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery . We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was . The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and , we think , must come down further . In the last 21 months , more than 6 million people have gotten jobs there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working , where there were only 99 million before 107 , if you count the military . So , we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending the increase , rate of increase in government spending , which has come down from 17 to 6 percent , and , at the same time , as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets , without raising taxes , those two lines will meet . And when they meet , that is a balanced budget . The deficit is the result of excessive government spending . I do not , very frankly , take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections , because they have been wrong on virtually all of them , including the fact that our recovery was not going to take place to begin with . But it has taken place . But , as I said , we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent . If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent we are not far from there by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a 30 or 40 billion level . At the same time , if we can have a 4 percent recovery continue through that same period of time , that will mean without an increase in tax rates that will mean 400 billion more in government revenues . And so , I think that the lines can meet . Actually , in constant dollars , in the domestic side of the budget , there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here . that people need . These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have , and I am not going to do it that way . The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed . Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than 7 , 000 . And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life . And that is why the Congress , including the Republicans , have not gone along with the President s recommendations . Yes . I do not believe that Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget he has a plan for raising taxes . And , as a matter of fact , the biggest single tax increase in our nation s history took place 1977 . And for the 5 years previous to our taking office , taxes doubled in the United States , and the budgets increased 318 billion . So , there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget . Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people , you are taking the same amount of money out of the private sector , unless and until you bring down government s share of what it is taking . With regard to Social Security , I hope there ll be more time than just this minute to mention that , but I will say this A President should never say never . But I am going to violate that rule and say never . I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them . Well , whether he does or not , let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor , since you have asked it . And , incidentally , I might say that with regard to the 25 percent cut in Social Security before I get to the answer to your question the only 25 percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase , was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916 . Now , leadership . First of all , I think you must have some principles you believe in . In mine , I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society that they , not government , are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible , with an orderly society . Now , having that , I think also that in leadership well , I believe that you find people , positions such as I am in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government . I do not believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who is going to play tennis on the White House court . And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy , not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job . You are ultimately responsible , however , for that job . But I also believe something else about that . I believe that and when I became Governor of California , I started this , and I continue it in this office that any issue that comes before me , I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue . I do not want to hear them . I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people is it morally right And on that basis and that basis alone , we make a decision on every issue . Now , with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration , his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times , said they were not to be abhorred that , as a matter of fact , he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled , because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment . Our policy was not to cut subsidies . We have believed in partnership , and that was an example of a partnership between , not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure . And this is what we have been trying to do , is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships . We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people , and we are going to continue along that line . We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow , whether because of age or need . We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country , and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need . The safety net is there , and we are taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country . The fact of it is The President s budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent . It is not an opinion it is a fact . And when the President was asked the other day , What do you want to cut in the budget he said , Cut those things I asked for but did not get . That is Social Security and Medicare . The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President s budget sought to terminate . So , if he had had his way , there would not have been any housing project there at all . This administration has taken a meat cleaver out , in terms of Federal assisted housing , and the record is there . We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions . Well , let me just respond with regard to Social Security . When we took office , we discovered that the program that the Carter Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years would not solve them for 5 . Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983 . Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman , a Democrat , of one of the leading committees , who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce . And so , we made a proposal . And then in 1982 , they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign . And 3 days after the election in 1982 , they came to us and said , Social Security , we know , is broke . Indeed , we had to borrow 17 billion to pay the checks . And then I asked for a bipartisan commission , which I had asked for from the beginning , to sit down and work out a solution . And so , the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation , and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century . Well , I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy . In our particular church , we did not use that term , born again , so I do not know whether I would fit that that particular term . But I have thanks to my mother , God rest her soul the firmest possible belief and faith in God . And I do not believe I believe , I should say , as Lincoln once said , that I could not I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others . And I do resort to prayer . At the same time , however , I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign or religion a part of that campaign . As a matter of fact , I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mondale s running mate said I was not a good Christian . So , it does play a part in my life . I have no hesitancy in saying so . And , as I say , I do not believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered . The answer to your question is very simple about why I do not go to church . I have gone to church regularly all my life , and I started to here in Washington . And now , in the position I hold and in the world in which we live , where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut we are supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st , I understand but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church . I know the threats that are made against me . We all know the possibility of terrorism . We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House . And , therefore , I do not feel and my minister knows this and supports me in this position I do not feel that I have a right to go to church , knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places , in Beirut , for example . And I miss going to church , but I think the Lord understands . may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause . Fred , your second question . what I object to what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others . A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement , because he believes his faith instructs him to do that , I admire . The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people , hopefully , I accept and rejoice in . It is when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political or private religious faith and the use of the state is where for the most personal decisions in American life that is where I draw the line . Yes , it is very difficult to rebut , because I find myself in so much agreement with Mondale . too , want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there . The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side , using the government , using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion , it shall not inhibit the practice of religion . And they have been using these things to have government , through court orders , inhibit the practice of religion . A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they cannot do it because it is school property . These are the types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation , and I am opposed to that . With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court , I can only say one thing about that . I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court Sandra Day O Connor . I will stand on my record on that . And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more , I will do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her . Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate , away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority . Blue collar workers , young professionals , their children , and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats , and the gap the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing . I had like to ask you , Mondale , what is causing this Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans What do you think needs to be done about it , as a Democrat Well , again , I am running on the record . I think sometimes Mondale s running away from his . But I am running on the record of what we have asked for . We will continue to try to get things that we did not get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6 . 1 percent , a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government . And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago I know , because I was a Democrat at that time . And I left the party eventually , because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path , a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government , lacking trust in the American people . I promised , when we took office , that we would reduce inflation . We have , to one third of what it was . I promised that we would reduce taxes . We did , 25 percent across the board . That barely held even with if it did that much with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977 . But at least it took that burden away from them . I said that we would create jobs for our people , and we did 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months . I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament , reduction of arms , and , hopefully , an elimination of nuclear weapons . We have done that . All of the things that I said we would do , from inflation being down , interest rates being down , unemployment falling , all of those things we have done . And I think this is something the American people see . I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education on excellence in education . And today , without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them , the school districts , the words from that commission , we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems . We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth . All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years . So , I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw The leadership is not taking us where we want to go . There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well , and you have named some of them . Crime has come down the last 2 years , for the first time in many , many decades that it has come down or since we have kept records 2 consecutive years , and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we have had . I think that we have had something to do with that , just as we have with the drug problem nationwide . The environment Yes , I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment . When we took office , we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards , lack of safety features , that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5 year program but it is just about finished already a billion dollars . And now we are going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks . We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands , to the game refuges . I think that we are out in front of most and I see that the red light is blinking , so I cannot continue . But I have got more . Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President , I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States . And so , my change had come earlier than that . I had not gotten around to reregistering as yet . I found that was rather difficult to do . But I finally did it . There are some other things that have been said here back , and you said that I might be able to dredge them up . Mondale referred to the farmers worst year . The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done . The farmers were the victims of the double digit inflation and the 21 1 2 percent interest rates of the Carter Mondale administration and the grain embargo , which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier . All of these things are presently being rectified , and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers . As a matter of fact , there has been less than one quarter of i percent of foreclosures of the 270 , 000 loans from government that the farmers have . I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life . Now , that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life . But with regard to abortion , and I have a feeling that this is there is been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mondale tied to injecting religion into government . With me , abortion is not a problem of religion , it is a problem of the Constitution . I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being , then that child is already protected by the Constitution , which guarantees life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness to all of us . And I think that this is what we should concentrate on , is trying I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee , there were medical authorities , there were religious there were clerics there everyone talking about this matter of pro life . And at the end of all of that , not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive . We have seen premature births that are now grown up , happy people going around . Also , there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life . In California , sometime ago , a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull , and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then Democratic Governor signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder . Now , is not it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child , and it was abortion and not murder , but if somebody else does it , that is murder And it used the term death of the unborn child . So , this has been my feeling about abortion , that we have a problem now to determine and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being . The laws regarding that always were state laws . It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a state policy . Our laws against murder are state laws . So , I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this . As I say , I feel that we have a problem here to resolve . And no one has approached it from that matter . It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma . I know that some churches do . Now , it is a sin if you are taking a human life . At the same time , in our Judeo Christian tradition , we recognize the right of taking a human life in self defense . And therefore , I have always believed that a mother , if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy , she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own . Yes . Well , with regard to this being a personal choice , is not that what a murderer is insisting on , his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that Now , I am not capable , and I do not think you are , any of us , to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life . I am simply saying that I believe that that is where the effort should be directed to make that determination . I do not think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self defense tradition . That , too , would have to be worked out then , when you once recognize that we are talking about a life . But in this great society of ours , would not it make a lot more sense , in this gentle and kind society , if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child , that instead we make it available for the adoption There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who cannot have them any other way . You know , I was not going to say this at all , but I cannot help it . There you go again . I do not have a plan to tax or increase taxes . I am not going to increase taxes . I can understand why you are , Mondale , because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes . Now , I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed it is that government is overfed . And I think that most of our people this is why we had a 25 percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up . And , as a matter of fact , it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes , those above 50 , 000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage wise as did those from 50 , 000 down . From 50 , 000 down , those people paid two thirds of the taxes , and those people got two thirds of the tax cut . Now , the Social Security tax of 77 this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest . It had two features . It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time there are two more yet to come between now and 1989 . At the same time every year , it increased the amount of money virtually every year , there may have been one or two that were skipped in there that was subject to that tax . Today it is up to about 38 , 000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security . And that tax , there are no deductions , so a person making anywhere from 10 , 15 , 20 they are paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money . Now , I do not think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich , and not the other way around , it just does not work out that way . The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity , as I have said , and that has not been changed . But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage , yes , you could say , well , that person got 10 times as much as this other person . Yes , but he paid 10 times as much , also . But if you take it in percentages , then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board . Yes , I had used last resort would always be with me . If you got the government down to the lowest level , that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people , and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth , and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines , then I had said once that , yes , you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted . I do not foresee those things happening , so I say with great confidence I am not going to go for a tax . With regard to assailing Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid , I think if you looked at the deductions , there were great legal expenses in there had to do , possibly , with the sale of his home , and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust . All of those are legally deductions , deductible in computing your tax , and it was a 1 year thing with him . Yes . Mm hmm . And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States , and what are you going to do You have got a 260 billion deficit . You cannot wish it away . You will not slow defense spending you refuse to do that Yes . With regard to Medicare , no , but it is time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was , and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound . And , no , I never proposed any 20 billion should come out of Medicare I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem . And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent . I gave you back some of that time . Well , some of those facts and figures just do not stand up . Yes , there has been an increase in poverty , but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here . It has begun to decline , but it is still going up . On the other hand , women heads of household single women heads of household have for the first time there is been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them . We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty , it all had to do with their private earnings . It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs . We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980 . We are spending a third more on all of the well , all of the programs of human service . We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before 2 , 300 , 000 more are receiving them even though we took 850 , 000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them . We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits . We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy . Some time ago , Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind . Half one out of two of the full time college students in the United States are receiving some form of federal aid . But there , again , we found people that there under the previous administration , families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low interest college loans . We did not think that was right . And so , we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college , their family incomes were so low . So , there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been , taking care of more people than they ever have . 7 . 7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings 7 . 7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over , leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million . Yes . That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything . I remember distinctly , I was segueing into another subject . I was talking about the things that have been accomplished , and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism , the new spirit that we are finding all over America . And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people . So , that was the only place that that was used . I did avoid , I am afraid , in my previous answer , also , the idea of uneven , yes . There is no way that the recovery is even across the country , just as in the depths of the recession , there were some parts of the country that were worse off , but some that did not even feel the pain of the recession . We are not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one , until the recovery is complete across the country . Yes . The connection that is been made again between the deficit and the interest rates there is no connection between them . There is a connection between interest rates and inflation , but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter Mondale budget that we inherited that the interest rates came down from 21 1 2 , down toward the 12 or 13 figure . And while they were coming down , the deficits had started their great increase . They were going up . Now , if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down . The interest rates are based on inflation . And right now I have to tell you I do not think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low . I think it can only be that they are anticipating or hope expecting , not hoping , that maybe we do not have a control of inflation and it is going to go back up again . Well , it is not going to go back up . We are going to see that it does not . And I have not got time to answer with regard to the disabled . I am going to use my time a little differently . I am going to give the President some credit . I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit , morale , good feeling in this country , and he is entitled to credit for that . What I think we need , however , is not just that but to move forward , not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America s problems . I think in education , when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline , I did not like it at first , but I think it helped a little bit . But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training . I like President Reagan . And this is not personal there are deep differences about our future , and that is the basis of my campaign . Well , now , I have to start with a smile , since his kind words to me . I will tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog , both in this campaign and the one in 82 . And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them . And why I think it is outrageous first of all , it is not true . But why it is outrageous is because , for political advantage , every time they do that , they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security , have no place else to turn . And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking , Is this true Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute And I do not think that that should be a part of political dialog . Now , to I still I just have a minute here Oh , I Okay . All right . Now , Social Security , let us lay it to rest once and for all . I told you never would I do such a thing . But I tell you also now , Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit . Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee . If you reduce the out go of Social Security , that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit . It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund . So , Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit . Now , again , to get to whether I am depending on magic , I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told would not work . And then , after it worked , I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation . And none of these things happened . It is working , and we are going to continue on that same line . As to what we might do , and find in further savings cuts , no , we are not going to starve the hungry . But we have 2 , 478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2 , 000 business people in this country , through the Grace commission , that we are studying right now and we have already implemented 17 percent of them that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient , more economic . Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now , but that in 1976 , when the deficit was 52 billion and everyone was panicking about that , he said , no , that he thought it ought to be bigger , because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment . In 1979 he made similar statements , the same effect , that the deficits there was nothing wrong with having deficits . Remember , there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here . That is got to be paid by our children and grandchildren , too , if we do not do it . And I am hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here . That is why I want another 4 years . No , I might as well just go with I do not think so . I am all confused now . You do not get those same voices . I am not hearing it from here I am hearing it from here . All right . Well , we will include it in that . Four years ago , in similar circumstances to this , I asked you , the American people , a question . I asked Are you better off than you were 4 years before The answer to that obviously was no , and as the result , I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning . Now , maybe I am expected to ask that same question again . I am not going to , because I think that all of you or not everyone , those people that are in those pockets of poverty and have not caught up , they could not answer the way I would want them to but I think that most of the people in this country would say , yes , they are better off than they were 4 years ago . The question , I think , should be enlarged . Is America better off than it was 4 years ago And I believe the answer to that has to also be yes . I promised a new beginning . So far , it is only a beginning . If the job were finished , I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job . But we now have an economy that , for the first time well , let us put it this way In the first half of 1980 , gross national product was down a minus 3 . 7 percent . The first half of 84 it is up 8 1 2 percent . Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent . Today it is up a plus 4 percent . Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost 3 , 000 in these 4 years . In 1980 or 1979 , a person with a fixed income of 8 , 000 was 500 above the poverty line , and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty . By 1980 that same person was 500 below the poverty line . We have restored much of our economy . With regard to business investment , it is higher than it has been since 1949 . So , there seems to be no shortage of investment capital . We have , as I said , cut the taxes , but we have reduced inflation , and for 2 years now it has stayed down there , not at double digit , but in the range of 4 or below . We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure . Yes , we have an increase in the defense budget . But back then we had planes that could not fly for lack of spare parts or pilots . We had navy vessels that could not leave harbor because of lack of crew or , again , lack of spare parts . Today we are well on our way to a 600 ship navy . We have 543 at present . We have our military , the morale is high . I think the people should understand that two thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary , or pay and pension . And then you add to that food and wardrobe , and all the other things , and you only have a small portion going for weapons . But I am determined that if ever our men are called on , they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons . There has been reference to expensive spare parts , hammers costing 500 . Well , we are the ones who found those . I think we have given the American people back their spirit . I think there is an optimism in the land and a patriotism , and I think that we are in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine , who said We have it in our power to begin the world over again .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans I have spoken to you from this historic office on many occasions and about many things . The power of the Presidency is often thought to reside within this Oval Office . Yet it does not rest here it rests in you , the American people , and in your trust . Your trust is what gives a President his powers of leadership and his personal strength , and it is what I want to talk to you about this evening . For the past three months , I have been silent on the revelations about Iran . And you must have been thinking Well , why does not he tell us what is happening Why does not he just speak to us as he has in the past when we have faced troubles or tragedies Others of you , I guess , were thinking What is he doing hiding out in the White House Well , the reason I have not spoken to you before now is this You deserve the truth . And as frustrating as the waiting has been , I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports , or possibly even erroneous statements , which would then have to be corrected , creating even more doubt and confusion . There is been enough of that . I have paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence . But I have had to wait , as you have , for the complete story . That is why I appointed Ambassador David Abshire as my Special Counsellor to help get out the thousands of documents to the various investigations . And I appointed a Special Review Board , the Tower board , which took on the chore of pulling the truth together for me and getting to the bottom of things . It has now issued its findings . I am often accused of being an optimist , and it is true I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good news in the Board s report . As you know , it is well stocked with criticisms , which I will discuss in a moment but I was very relieved to read this sentence . . . the Board is convinced that the President does indeed want the full story to be told . And that will continue to be my pledge to you as the other investigations go forward . I want to thank the members of the panel former Senator John Tower , former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie , and former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft . They have done the Nation , as well as me personally , a great service by submitting a report of such integrity and depth . They have my genuine and enduring gratitude . I have studied the Board s report . Its findings are honest , convincing , and highly critical and I accept them . And tonight I want to share with you my thoughts on these findings and report to you on the actions I am taking to implement the Board s recommendations . First , let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration . As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge , I am still accountable for those activities . As disappointed as I may be in some who served me , I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior . And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds well , as the Navy would say , this happened on my watch . Let us start with the part that is the most controversial . A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages . My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true , but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not . As the Tower board reported , what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated , in its implementation , into trading arms for hostages . This runs counter to my own beliefs , to administration policy , and to the original strategy we had in mind . There are reasons why it happened , but no excuses . It was a mistake . I undertook the original Iran initiative in order to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post Khomeini government . It is clear from the Board s report , however , that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geopolitical strategy of reaching out to Iran . I asked so many questions about the hostages welfare that I did not ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan . Let me say to the hostage families We have not given up . We never will . And I promise you we will use every legitimate means to free your loved ones from captivity . But I must also caution that those Americans who freely remain in such dangerous areas must know that they are responsible for their own safety . Now , another major aspect of the Board s findings regards the transfer of funds to the Nicaraguan contras . The Tower board was not able to find out what happened to this money , so the facts here will be left to the continuing investigations of the court appointed Independent Counsel and the two congressional investigating committees . I am confident the truth will come out about this matter , as well . As I told the Tower board , I did not know about any diversion of funds to the contras . But as President , I cannot escape responsibility . Much has been said about my management style , a style that is worked successfully for me during 8 years as Governor of California and for most of my Presidency . The way I work is to identify the problem , find the right individuals to do the job , and then let them go to it . I have found this invariably brings out the best in people . They seem to rise to their full capability , and in the long run you get more done . When it came to managing the NSC staff , let us face it , my style did not match its previous track record . I have already begun correcting this . As a start , yesterday I met with the entire professional staff of the National Security Council . I defined for them the values I want to guide the national security policies of this country . I told them that I wanted a policy that was as justifiable and understandable in public as it was in secret . I wanted a policy that reflected the will of the Congress as well as of the White House . And I told them that there ll be no more freelancing by individuals when it comes to our national security . You have heard a lot about the staff of the National Security Council in recent months . Well , I can tell you , they are good and dedicated government employees , who put in long hours for the Nation s benefit . They are eager and anxious to serve their country . One thing still upsetting me , however , is that no one kept proper records of meetings or decisions . This led to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arms shipment before or after the fact . I did approve it I just cannot say specifically when . Well , rest assured , there is plenty of recordkeeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . For nearly a week now , I have been studying the Board s report . I want the American people to know that this wrenching ordeal of recent months has not been in vain . I endorse every one of the Tower board s recommendations . In fact , I am going beyond its recommendations so as to put the house in even better order . I am taking action in three basic areas personnel , national security policy , and the process for making sure that the system works . First , personnel I have brought in an accomplished and highly respected new team here at the White House . They bring new blood , new energy , and new credibility and experience . Former Senator Howard Baker , my new Chief of Staff , possesses a breadth of legislative and foreign affairs skills that is impossible to match . I am hopeful that his experience as minority and majority leader of the Senate can help us forge a new partnership with the Congress , especially on foreign and national security policies . I am genuinely honored that he is given up his own Presidential aspirations to serve the country as my Chief of Staff . Frank Carlucci , my new national security adviser , is respected for his experience in government and trusted for his judgment and counsel . Under him , the NSC staff is being rebuilt with proper management discipline . Already , almost half the NSC professional staff is comprised of new people . Yesterday I nominated William Webster , a man of sterling reputation , to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency . Webster has served as Director of the FBI and as a District Court judge . He understands the meaning of rule of law . So that his knowledge of national security matters can be available to me on a continuing basis , I will also appoint John Tower to serve as a member of my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board . I am considering other changes in personnel , and I will move more furniture , as I see fit , in the weeks and months ahead . Second , in the area of national security policy , I have ordered the NSC to begin a comprehensive review of all covert operations . I have also directed that any covert activity be in support of clear policy objectives and in compliance with American values . I expect a covert policy that , if Americans saw it on the front page of their newspaper , they had say , That makes sense . I have had issued a directive prohibiting the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations no ifs , ands , or buts . I have asked Vice President Bush to reconvene his task force on terrorism to review our terrorist policy in light of the events that have occurred . Third , in terms of the process of reaching national security decisions , I am adopting in total the Tower report s model of how the NSC process and staff should work . I am directing Carlucci to take the necessary steps to make that happen . He will report back to me on further reforms that might be needed . I have created the post of NSC legal adviser to assure a greater sensitivity to matters of law . I am also determined to make the congressional oversight process work . Proper procedures for consultation with the Congress will be followed , not only in letter but in spirit . Before the end of March , I will report to the Congress on all the steps I have taken in line with the Tower board s conclusions . Now , what should happen when you make a mistake is this You take your knocks , you learn your lessons , and then you move on . That is the healthiest way to deal with a problem . This in no way diminishes the importance of the other continuing investigations , but the business of our country and our people must proceed . I have gotten this message from Republicans and Democrats in Congress , from allies around the world , and if we are reading the signals right even from the Soviets . And of course , I have heard the message from you , the American people . You know , by the time you reach my age , you have made plenty of mistakes . And if you have lived your life properly so , you learn . You put things in perspective . You pull your energies together . You change . You go forward . My fellow Americans , I have a great deal that I want to accomplish with you and for you over the next two years . And the Lord willing , that is exactly what I intend to do . Good night , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Officers and men and women of the corps , ladies and gentlemen , I came here today to pay homage to the heroes of Lebanon and Grenada . We grieve along with the families of these brave , proud Americans who have given their lives for their country and for the preservation of peace . I have just met with the families of many of those who were killed . I think all Americans would cradle them in our arms if we could . We share their sorrow . I want all of you who lost loved ones and friends to know that the thoughts and prayers of this nation are with you . If this country is to remain a force for good in the world , we will face times like these , times of sadness and loss . Your fellow citizens know and appreciate that marines and their families are carrying a heavy burden . America seeks no new territory , nor do we wish to dominate others . We commit our resources and risk the lives of those in our Armed Forces to rescue others from bloodshed and turmoil and to prevent humankind from drowning in a sea of tyranny . In Lebanon , along with our allies , we are working hard to help bring peace to that war torn country and stability to the vital Middle East . In seeking to stabilize the situation in Lebanon , you marines and sailors and our French , Italian , and English companions are peacekeepers in the truest sense of the word . The world looks to America for leadership . And America looks to the men in its Armed Forces to the Corps of Marines , to the Navy , the Army . Freedom is being tested throughout the world . In Burma , that government has announced conclusive evidence of North Korean responsibility for the atrocity taking the lives of many members of the Korean Government . We stand with South Korea , and I will be going there next week to carry our message to them , a message of revulsion of this atrocity , determination to stand with our friends in support of freedom . In the Middle East this morning , we have learned of yet another terrorist assault similar to the attack against our marines , this time against an Israeli site in Tyre , Lebanon . In spite of the complexity and special hardships of the Lebanese crisis , we have stood firm . As ever , leathernecks are willing to accept their mission and do their duty . This honest patriotism and dedication to duty overwhelms the rest of us . In Grenada , our military forces moved quickly and professionally to protect American lives and respond to an urgent request from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States . We joined in an effort to restore order and democracy to that strife torn island . Only days before our actions , Prime Minister Maurice Bishop had been brutally murdered , along with several members of his Cabinet and unarmed civilians . With a thousand Americans , including some 800 students , on that island , we were not about to wait for the Iran crisis to repeat itself , only this time , in our own neighborhood the Caribbean . In a free society there is bound to be disagreement about any decisive course of action . Some of those so quick to criticize our operation in Grenada , I invite them to read the letters I have received from those students and their families . They know this was no invasion they know it was a rescue mission . Marines have a saying We take care of our own . Well , America , with the help of marines , will take care of our own . And our brave marines , soldiers , and special forces including the truly gallant Navy Seals were not just coming to the aid of our students . I hope every American will be able to hear the stories of the political prisoners who have been freed . The citizens of Grenada , who watched helplessly as their country was being stolen from them and turned into a staging area for totalitarian aggression these same Grenadians are hailing us as liberators , and they are doing everything they can now to help . Every American can be proud of the professional and gallant job that our Armed Forces have done . And all of us can rejoice that they are coming home . I came here today to honor so many who did their duty and gave that last , full measure of their devotion . They kept faith with us and our way of life . We would not be free long , but for the dedication of such individuals . They were heroes . We are grateful to have had them with us . The motto of the United States Marine Corps Semper Fidelis always faithful . Well , the rest of us must remain always faithful to those ideals which so many have given their lives to protect . Our heritage of liberty must be preserved and passed on . Let no terrorist question our will or no tyrant doubt our resolve . Americans have courage and determination , and we must not and will not be intimidated by anyone , anywhere . Since 1775 , marines , just like many of you , have shaped the strength and resolve of the United States . Your role is as important today as at any time in our history . Our hearts go out to the families of the brave men that we honor today . Let us close ranks with them in tribute to our fallen heroes , their loved ones , who gave more than can ever be repaid . They are now part of the soul of this great country and will live as long as out liberty shines as a beacon of hope to all those who long for freedom and a better world . One of the men in the early days of our nation , John Stuart Mill , said , War is an ugly thing , but not the ugliest of things . The ugliest is that man who thinks nothing is worth fighting or dying for and lets men better and braver than himself protect him . You are doing that for all of us . God bless you , and thank you for what you are doing .<speech_sep>
