To the Senate and House of Representatives In the month of November I visited the Isthmus of Panama , going over the Canal Zone with considerable care and also visited the cities of Panama and Colon , which are not in the Zone or under the United States flag , but as to which the United States Government , through its agents , exercises control for certain sanitary purposes . The Louisiana , on which I was , anchored off Colon about half past two on Wednesday afternoon , November 14 . I came aboard her , after my stay on shore , at about half past 9 on Saturday evening , November 17 . On Wednesday afternoon and evening I received the President of Panama and his suite , and saw members of the Canal Commission , and various other gentlemen , perfecting the arrangement for my visit , so that every hour that I was ashore could be employed to advantage . I was three days ashore not a sufficient length of time to allow of an exhaustive investigation of the minutiae of the work of any single department , still less to pass judgment on the engineering problems , but enough to enable me to get a clear idea of the salient features of the great work and of the progress that has been made as regards the sanitation of the Zone , Colon , and Panama , the caring for and housing of the employees , and the actual digging of the canal . The Zone is a narrow strip of land , and it can be inspected much as one can inspect 50 or 60 miles of a great railroad , at the point where it rims through mountains or overcomes other national obstacles . I chose the month of November for my visit partly because it is the rainiest month of the year , the month in which the work goes forward at the greatest disadvantage , and one of the two months which the medical department of the French Canal Company found most unhealthy . Immediately after anchoring on the afternoon of Wednesday there was a violent storm of wind and rain . From that time we did not again see the sun until Saturday morning , the rain continuing almost steadily , but varying from a fine drizzle to a torrential downpour . During that time in fifteen minutes at Cristobal 1 . 05 inches of rain fell from 1 to 3 M . , November 16 , 3 . 2 inches fell for the twenty four hours ending noon , November 16 , 4 . 68 inches fell , and for the six days ending noon , November 16 , 10 . 24 inches fell . The Changes rose in flood to a greater height than it had attained during the last fifteen years , tearing out the track in one place . It would have been impossible to see the work going on under more unfavorable weather conditions . On Saturday , November 17 , the sun shone now and then for a few minutes , although the day was generally overcast and there were heavy showers at intervals . On Thursday morning we landed at about half past seven and went slowly over the line of the Panama Railway , ending with an expedition in a tug at the Pacific entrance of the canal out to the islands where the dredging for the canal will cease . We took our dinner at one of the eating houses furnished by the Commission for the use of the Government employees no warning of our coming being given . I inspected the Ancon Hospital , going through various wards both for white patients and for colored patients . I inspected portions of the constabulary Zone police , examining the men individually . I also examined certain of the schools and saw the school children , both white and colored , speaking with certain of the teachers . In the afternoon of this day I was formally received in Panama by President Amador , who , together with the Government and all the people of Panama , treated me with the most considerate courtesy , for which I hereby extend my most earnest thanks . I was driven through Panama and in a public square was formally received and welcomed by the President and other members of the Government and in the evening I attended a dinner given by the President , and a reception , which was also a Government function . I also drove through the streets of Panama for the purpose of observing what had been done . We slept at the Hotel Tivoli , at Ancon , which is on a hill directly outside of the city of Panama , but in the Zone . On Friday morning we left the hotel at 7 of the clock and spent the entire day going through the Culebra cut the spot in which most work will have to be done in any event . We watched the different steam shovels working we saw the drilling and blasting we saw many of the dirt trains of the two different types used , both carrying the earth away from the steam shovels and depositing it on the dumps some of the dumps being run out in the jungle merely to get rid of the earth , while in other cases they are being used for double tracking the railway , and in preparing to build the great dams . I visited many of the different villages , inspecting thoroughly many different buildings the local receiving hospitals , the houses in which the unmarried white workmen live , those in which the unmarried colored workmen live also the quarters of the white married employees and of the married colored employees as well as the commissary stores , the bath houses , the water closets , the cook sheds for the colored laborers , and the Government canteens , or hotels , at which most of the white employees take their meals . I went through the machine shops . During the day I talked with scores of different men superintendents and heads of departments , divisions , and bureaus steam shovel men , machinists , conductors , engineers , clerks , wives of the American employees , health officers , colored laborers , colored attendants , and managers of the commissary stores where food is sold to the colored laborers wives of the colored employees who are married . In the evening I had an interview with the British consul , Mallet , a gentleman who for many years has well and honorably represented the British Government on the Isthmus of Panama and who has a peculiar relation to our work because the bulk of the colored laborers come from the British West Indies . I also saw the French consul , Gey , a gentleman of equally long service and honorable record . I saw the lieutenants , the chief executive and administrative officers , under the engineering and sanitary departments . I also saw and had long talks with two deputations one of machinists and one representing the railway men of the dirt trains listening to what they had to say as to the rate of pay and various other matters and going over , as much in detail as possible , all the different questions they brought up . As to some matters I was able to meet their wishes as to others , I felt that what they requested could not be done consistently with my duty to the United States Government as a whole as to yet others I reserved judgment . On Saturday morning we started at 8 of the clock from the hotel . We went through the Culebra cut , stopping off to see the marines , and also to investigate certain towns one , of white employees , as to which in certain respects complaint had been made to me and another town where I wanted to see certain houses of the colored employees . We went over the site of the proposed Gatun dam , having on the first day inspected the sites of the proposed La Boca and Sosa dams . We went out on a little toy railway to the reservoir , which had been built to supply the people of Colon with water for their houses . There we took lunch at the engineers mess . We then went through the stores and shops of Cristobal , inspecting carefully the houses of both the white and colored employees , married and unmarried , together with the other buildings . We then went to Colon and saw the fire department at work in four minutes from the signal the engines had come down to Front street , and twenty one 2 1 2 inch hose pipes were raising streams of water about 75 feet high . We rode about Colon , through the various streets , paved , unpaved , and in process of paving , looking at the ditches , sewers , curbing , and the lights . I then went over the Colon hospital in order to compare it with the temporary town or field receiving hospitals which I had already seen and inspected . I also inspected some of the dwellings of the employees . In the evening I attended a reception given by the American employees on the Isthmus , which took place on one of the docks in Colon , and from there went aboard the Louisiana . Each day from twelve to eighteen hours were spent in going over and inspecting all there was to be seen , and in examining various employees . Throughout my trip I was accompanied by the Surgeon General of the Navy , Rixey by the Chairman of the Isthmian Canal Commission , Shonts by Chief Engineer Stevens by Gorgas , the chief sanitary officer of the Commission by Bishop , the Secretary of the Commission by Ripley , the Principal Assistant Engineer by Jackson Smith , who has had practical charge of collecting and handling the laboring force by Bierd , general manager of the railway , and by Rogers , the general counsel of the Commission and many other officials joined us from time to time . At the outset I wish to pay a tribute to the amount of work done by the French Canal Company under very difficult circumstances . Many of the buildings they put up were excellent and are still in use , though , naturally , the houses are now getting out of repair and are being used as dwellings only until other houses can be built , and much of the work they did in the Culebra cut , and some of the work they did in digging has been of direct and real benefit . This country has never made a better investment than the 40 , 000 , 000 which it paid to the French Company for work and betterments , including especially the Panama Railroad . An inspection on the ground at the height of the rainy season served to convince me of the wisdom of Congress in refusing to adopt either a high level or a sea level canal . There seems to be a universal agreement among all people competent to judge that the Panama route , the one actually chosen , is much superior to both the Nicaragua and Darien routes . The wisdom of the canal management has been shown in nothing more clearly than in the way in which the foundations of the work have been laid . To have yielded to the natural impatience of ill informed outsiders and begun all kinds of experiments in work prior to a thorough sanitation of the Isthmus , and to a fairly satisfactory working out of the problem of getting and keeping a sufficient labor supply , would have been disastrous . The various preliminary measures had to be taken first and these could not be taken so as to allow us to begin the real work of construction prior to January 1 of the present year . It then became necessary to have the type of the canal decided , and the only delay has been the necessary delay until the 29th day of June , the date when the Congress definitely and wisely settled that we should have an 85 foot level canal . Immediately after that the work began in hard earnest and has been continued with increasing vigor ever since and it will continue so to progress in the future . When the contracts are let the conditions will be such as to insure a constantly increasing amount of performance . The first great problem to be solved , upon the solution of which the success of the rest of the work depended , was the problem of sanitation . This was from the outset under the direction of Gorgas , who is to be made a full member of the Commission . It must be remembered that his work was not mere sanitation as the term is understood in our ordinary municipal work . Throughout the Zone and in the two cities of Panama and Colon , in addition to the sanitation work proper , he has had to do all the work that the Marine Hospital Service does as regards the Nation , that the health department officers do in the various States and cities , and that Colonel Waring did in New York when he cleaned its streets . The results have been astounding . The Isthmus had been a by word for deadly unhealthfulness . Now , after two years of our occupation the conditions as regards sickness and the death rate compare favorably with reasonably healthy localities in the United States . Especial care has been devoted to minimizing the risk due to the presence of those species of mosquitoes which have been found to propagate malarial and yellow fevers . In all the settlements , the little temporary towns or cities composed of the white and black employees , which grow up here and there in the tropic jungle as the needs of the work dictate , the utmost care is exercised to keep the conditions healthy . Everywhere are to be seen the drainage ditches which in removing the water have removed the breeding places of the mosquitoes , while the whole jungle is cut away for a considerable space around the habitations , thus destroying the places in which the mosquitoes take shelter . These drainage ditches and clearings are in evidence in every settlement , and , together with the invariable presence of mosquito screens around the piazzas , and of mosquito doors to the houses , not to speak of the careful fumigation that has gone on in all infected houses , doubtless explain the extraordinary absence of mosquitoes . As a matter of fact , but a single mosquito , and this not of the dangerous species , was seen by any member of our party during my three days on the Isthmus . Equal care is taken by the inspectors of the health department to secure cleanliness in the houses and proper hygienic conditions of every kind . I inspected between twenty and thirty water closets , both those used by the white employees and those used by the colored laborers . In almost every case I found the conditions perfect . In but one case did I find them really bad . In this case , affecting a settlement of unmarried white employees , I found them very bad indeed , but the buildings were all inherited from the French Company and were being used temporarily while other buildings were in the course of construction and right near the defective water closet a new and excellent closet with a good sewer pipe was in process of construction and nearly finished . Nevertheless this did not excuse the fact that the bad condition had been allowed to prevail . Temporary accommodation , even if only such as soldiers use when camped in the field , should have been provided . Orders to this effect were issued . I append the report of Gorgas on the incident . I was struck , however , by the fact that in this instance , as in almost every other where a complaint was made which proved to have any justification whatever , it appeared that steps had already been taken to remedy the evil complained of , and that the trouble was mainly due to the extreme difficulty , and often impossibility , of providing in every place for the constant increase in the numbers of employees . Generally the provision is made in advance , but it is not possible that this should always be the case when it is not there ensues a period of time during which the conditions are unsatisfactory , until a remedy can be provided but I never found a case where the remedy was not being provided as speedily as possible . I inspected the large hospitals at Ancon and Colon , which are excellent examples of what tropical hospitals should be . I also inspected the receiving hospitals in various settlements . I went through a number of the wards in which the colored men are treated , a number of those in which the white men are treated Americans and Spaniards . Both white men and black men are treated exactly alike , and their treatment is as good as that which could be obtained in our first class hospitals at home . All the patients that I saw , with one or two exceptions , were laborers or other employees on the canal works and railways , most of them being colored men of the ordinary laborer stamp . Not only are the men carefully cared for whenever they apply for care , but so far as practicable a watch is kept to see that if they need it they are sent to the hospitals , whether they desire to go or not . From no responsible source did any complaint come to me as to the management of the hospital service , although occasionally a very ignorant West India negro when he is first brought into the hospital becomes frightened by the ordinary hospital routine . Just at present the health showing on the Isthmus is remarkably good so much better than in most sections of the United States that I do not believe that it can possibly continue at quite its present average . Thus , early in the present year a band of several hundred Spaniards were brought to the Isthmus as laborers , and additions to their number have been made from time to time yet since their arrival in February last but one of those Spaniards thus brought over to work on the canal has died of disease , and he of typhoid fever . Two others were killed , one in a railroad accident , and one by a dynamite explosion . There has been for the last six months a well nigh steady decline in the death rate for the population of the Zone , this being largely due to the decrease in deaths from pneumonia , which has been the most fatal disease on the Isthmus . In October there were ninety nine deaths of every kind among the employees of the Isthmus . There were then on the rolls 5 , 500 whites , seven eighths of them being Americans . Of these whites but two died of disease , and as it happened neither man was an American . Of the 6 , 000 white Americans , including some 1 , 200 women and children , not a single death has occurred in the past three months , whereas in an average city in the United States the number of deaths for a similar number of people in that time would have been about thirty from disease . This very remarkable showing cannot of course permanently obtain , but it certainly goes to prove that if good care is taken the Isthmus is not a particularly unhealthy place . In October , of the 19 , 000 negroes on the roll 86 died from disease pneumonia being the most destructive disease , and malarial fever coming second . The difficulty of exercising a thorough supervision over the colored laborers is of course greater than is the case among the whites , and they are also less competent to take care of themselves , which accounts for the fact that their death rate is so much higher than that of the whites , in spite of the fact that they have been used to similar climatic conditions . Even among the colored employees it will be seen that the death rate is not high . In Panama and Colon the death rate has also been greatly reduced , this being directly due to the vigorous work of the special brigade of employees who have been inspecting houses where the stegomyia mosquito is to be found , and destroying its larvae and breeding places , and doing similar work in exterminating the malarial mosquitoes in short , in performing all kinds of hygienic labor . A little over a year ago all kinds of mosquitoes , including the two fatal species , were numerous about the Culebra cut . In this cut during last October every room of every house was carefully examined , and only two mosquitoes , neither of them of the two fatal species , were found . Unfaltering energy in inspection and in disinfecting and in the work of draining and of clearing brush are responsible for the change . I append Gorgas s report on the health conditions also a letter from Surgeon General Rixey to Gorgas . The Surgeon General reported to me that the hygienic conditions on the Isthmus were about as good as , for instance , those in the Norfolk Navy Yard . Corozal , some four miles from La Boca , was formerly one of the most unsanitary places on the Isthmus , probably the most unsanitary . There was a marsh with a pond in the middle . Gorgas had both the marsh and pond drained and the brush cleared off , so that now , when I went over the ground , it appeared like a smooth meadow intersected by drainage ditches . The breeding places and sheltering spots of the dangerous mosquitoes had been completely destroyed . The result is that Corozal for the last six months like La Boca , which formerly also had a very unsanitary record , shows one of the best sick rates in the Zone , having less than 1 per cent a week admitted to the hospital . At Corozal there is a big hotel filled with employees of the Isthmian Canal Commission , some of them with their wives and families . Yet this healthy and attractive spot was stigmatized as a hog wallow by one of the least scrupulous and most foolish of the professional scandal mongers who from time to time have written about the Commission s work . The sanitation work in the cities of Panama and Colon has been just as important as in the Zone itself , and in many respects much more difficult because it was necessary to deal with the already existing population , which naturally had scant sympathy with revolutionary changes , the value of which they were for a long time not able to perceive . In Colon the population consists largely of colored laborers who , having come over from the West Indies to work on the canal , abandon the work and either take to the brush or lie idle in Colon itself thus peopling Colon with the least desirable among the imported laborers , for the good and steady men of course continue at the work . Yet astonishing progress has been made in both cities . In Panama 90 per cent of the streets that are to be paved at all are already paved with an excellent brick pavement laid in heavy concrete , a few of the streets being still in process of paving . The sewer and water services in the city are of the most modern hygienic type , some of the service having just been completed . In Colon the conditions are peculiar , and it is as regards Colon that most of the very bitter complaint has been made . Colon is built on a low coral island , covered at more or less shallow depths with vegetable accumulations or mold , which affords sustenance and strength to many varieties of low lying tropical plants . One half of the surface of the island is covered with water at high tide , the average height of the land being 1 1 2 feet above low tide . The slight undulations furnish shallow , natural reservoirs or fresh water breeding places for every variety of mosquito , and the ground tends to be lowest in the middle . When the town was originally built no attempt was made to fill the low ground , either in the streets or on the building sites , so that the entire surface was practically a quagmire when the quagmire became impassable certain of the streets were crudely improved by filling especially bad mud holes with soft rock or other material . In September , 1905 , a systematic effort was begun to formulate a general plan for the proper sanitation of the city in February last temporary relief measures were taken , while in July the prosecution of the work was begun in good earnest . The results are already visible in the sewering , draining , guttering and paving of the streets . Some four months will be required before the work of sewerage and street improvement will be completed , but the progress already made is very marked . Ditches have been dug through the town , connecting the salt water on both sides , and into these the ponds , which have served as breeding places for the mosquitoes , are drained . These ditches have answered their purpose , for they are probably the chief cause of the astonishing diminution in the number of mosquitoes . More ditches of the kind are being constructed . It was not practicable , with the force at the Commission s disposal , and in view of the need that the force should be used in the larger town of Panama , to begin this work before early last winter . Water mains were then laid in the town and water was furnished to the people early in March from a temporary reservoir . This reservoir proved to be of insufficient capacity before the end of the dry season and the shortage was made up by hauling water over the Panama railroad , so that there was at all times an ample supply of the very best water . Since that time the new reservoir back of Mount Hope has been practically completed . I visited this reservoir . It is a lake over a mile long and half a mile broad . It now carries some 500 , 000 , 000 gallons of first class water . I forward herewith a photograph of this lake , together with certain other photographs of what I saw while I was on the Isthmus . Nothing but a cataclysm will hereafter render it necessary in the dry season to haul water for the use of Colon and Cristobal . One of the most amusing as well as dishonest attacks made upon the Commission was in connection with this reservoir . The writer in question usually confined himself to vague general mendacity but in this case he specifically stated that there was no water in the vicinity fit for a reservoir I drank it , and it was excellent , and that this particular reservoir would never hold water anyway . Accompanying this message , as I have said above , is a photograph of the reservoir as I myself saw it , and as it has been in existence ever since the article in question was published . With typical American humor , the engineering corps still at work at the reservoir have christened a large boat which is now used on the reservoir by the name of the individual who thus denied the possibility of the reservoir s existence . I rode through the streets of Colon , seeing them at the height of the rainy season , after two days of almost unexampled downpour , when they were at their very worst . Taken as a whole they were undoubtedly very bad as bad as Pennsylvania avenue in Washington before Grant s Administration . Front street is already in thoroughly satisfactory shape , however . Some of the side streets are also in good condition . In others the change in the streets is rapidly going on . Through three fourths of the town it is now possible to walk , even during the period of tremendous rain , in low shoes without wetting one s feet , owing to the rapidity with which the surface water is carried away in the ditches . In the remaining one fourth of the streets the mud is very deep about as deep as in the ordinary street of a low lying prairie river town of the same size in the United States during early spring . All men to whom I spoke were a unit in saying that the conditions of the Colon streets were 100 per cent better than a year ago . The most superficial examination of the town shows the progress that has been made and is being made in macadamizing the streets . Complaint was made to me by an entirely reputable man as to the character of some of the material used for repairing certain streets . On investigation the complaint proved well rounded , but it also appeared that the use of the material in question had been abandoned , the Commission , after having tried it in one or two streets , finding it not appropriate . The result of the investigation of this honest complaint was typical of what occurred when I investigated most of the other honest complaints made to me . That is , where the complaints were not made wantonly or maliciously , they almost always proved due to failure to appreciate the fact that time was necessary in the creation and completion of this Titanic work in a tropic wilderness . It is impossible to avoid some mistakes in building a giant canal through jungle covered mountains and swamps , while at the same time sanitating tropic cities , and providing for the feeding and general care of from twenty to thirty thousand workers . The complaints brought to me , either of insufficient provision in caring for some of the laborers , or of failure to finish the pavements of Colon , or of failure to supply water , or of failure to build wooden sidewalks for the use of the laborers in the rainy season , on investigation proved , almost without exception , to be due merely to the utter inability of the Commission to do everything at once . For instance , it was imperative that Panama , which had the highest death rate and where the chance of a yellow fever epidemic was strongest , should be cared for first yet most of the complaints as to the delay in taking care of Colon were due to the inability or unwillingness to appreciate this simple fact . Again , as the thousands of laborers are brought over and housed , it is not always possible at the outset to supply wooden walks and bath houses , because other more vital necessities have to be met and in consequence , while most of the settlements have good bath houses , and , to a large extent at least , wooden walks , there are plenty of settlements where wooden walks have not yet been laid down , and I visited one where the bath houses have not been provided . But in this very settlement the frames of the bath houses are already up , and in every case the utmost effort is being made to provide the wooden walks . Of course , in some of the newest camps tents are used pending the building of houses . Where possible , I think detached houses would be preferable to the semi detached houses now in general use . Care and forethought have been exercised by the Commission , and nothing has reflected more credit upon them than their refusal either to go ahead too fast or to be deterred by the fear of criticism from not going ahead fast enough . It is curious to note the fact that many of the most severe critics of the Commission criticize them for precisely opposite reasons , some complaining bitterly that the work is not in a more advanced condition , while the others complain that it has been rushed with such haste that there has been insufficient preparation for the hygiene and comfort of the employees . As a matter of fact neither criticism is just . It would have been impossible to go quicker than the Commission has gone , for such quickness would have meant insufficient preparation . On the other hand , to refuse to do anything until every possible future contingency had been met would have caused wholly unwarranted delay . The right course to follow was exactly the course which has been followed . Every reasonable preparation was made in advance , the hygienic conditions in especial being made as nearly perfect as possible while on the other hand there has been no timid refusal to push forward the work because of inability to anticipate every possible emergency , for , of course , many defects can only be shown by the working of the system in actual practice . In addition to attending to the health of the employees , it is , of course , necessary to provide for policing the Zone . This is done by a police force which at present numbers over 200 men , under Captain Shanton . About one fifth of the men are white and the others black . In different places I questioned some twenty or thirty of these men , taking them at random . They were a fine set , physically and in discipline . With one exception all the white men I questioned had served in the American army , usually in the Philippines , and belonged to the best type of American soldier . Without exception the black policemen whom I questioned had served either in the British army or in the Jamaica or Barbados police . They were evidently contented , and were doing their work well . Where possible the policemen are used to control people of their own color , but in any emergency no hesitation is felt in using them indiscriminately . Inasmuch as so many both of the white and colored employees have brought their families with them , schools have been established , the school service being under O Connor . For the white pupils white American teachers are employed for the colored pupils there are also some white American teachers , one Spanish teacher , and one colored American teacher , most of them being colored teachers from Jamaica , Barbados , and Lucia . The schoolrooms were good , and it was a pleasant thing to see the pride that the teachers were taking in their work and their pupils . There seemed to me to be too many saloons in the Zone but the new high license law which goes into effect on January 1 next will probably close four fifths of them . Resolute and successful efforts are being made to minimize and control the sale of liquor . The cars on the passenger trains on the Isthmus are divided into first and second class , the difference being marked in the price of tickets . As a rule second class passengers are colored and first class passengers white but in every train which I saw there were a number of white second class passengers , and on two of them there were colored first class passengers . Next in importance to the problem of sanitation , and indeed now of equal importance , is the problem of securing and caring for the mechanics , laborers , and other employees who actually do the work on the canal and the railroad . This great task has been under the control of Jackson Smith , and on the whole has been well done . At present there are some 6 , 000 white employees and some 19 , 000 colored employees on the Isthmus . I went over the different places where the different kinds of employees were working I think I saw representatives of every type both at their work and in their homes and I conversed with probably a couple of hundred of them all told , choosing them at random from every class and including those who came especially to present certain grievances . I found that those who did not come specifically to present grievances almost invariably expressed far greater content and satisfaction with the conditions than did those who called to make complaint . Nearly 5 , 000 of the white employees had come from the United States . No man can see these young , vigorous men energetically doing their duty without a thrill of pride in them as Americans . They represent on the average a high class . Doubtless to Congress the wages paid them will seem high , but as a matter of fact the only general complaint which I found had any real basis among the complaints made to me upon the Isthmus was that , owing to the peculiar surroundings , the cost of living , and the distance from home , the wages were really not as high as they should be . In fact , almost every man I spoke to felt that he ought to be receiving more money a view , however , which the average man who stays at home in the United States probably likewise holds as regards himself . I append figures of the wages paid , so that the Congress can judge the matter for itself . Later I shall confer on the subject with certain representative labor men here in the United States , as well as going over with Stevens , the comparative wages paid on the Zone and at home and I may then communicate my findings to the canal committees of the two Houses . The white Americans are employed , some of them in office work , but the majority in handling the great steam shovels , as engineers and conductors on the dirt trains , as machinists in the great repair shops , as carpenters and time keepers , superintendents , and foremen of divisions and of gangs , and so on and so on . Many of them have brought down their wives and families and the children when not in school are running about and behaving precisely as the American small boy and small girl behave at home . The bachelors among the employees live , sometimes in small separate houses , sometimes in large houses quarters being furnished free to all the men , married and unmarried . Usually the bachelors sleep two in a room , as they would do in this country . I found a few cases where three were in a room and I was told of , although I did not see , large rooms in which four were sleeping for it is not possible in what is really a vast system of construction camps always to provide in advance as ample house room as the Commission intend later to give . In one case , where the house was an old French house with a leak in the roof , I did not think the accommodations were good . But in every other case among the scores of houses I entered at random , the accommodations were good every room was neat and clean , usually having books , magazines , and small ornaments and in short just such a room as a self respecting craftsman would be glad to live in at home . The quarters for the married people were even better . Doubtless there must be here and there a married couple who , with or without reason , are not contented with their house on the Isthmus but I never happened to strike such a couple . The wives of the steam shovel men , engineers , machinists , and carpenters into whose houses I went , all with one accord expressed their pleasure in their home life and surroundings . Indeed , I do not think they could have done otherwise . The houses themselves were excellent bathroom , sitting room , piazza , and bedrooms being all that could be desired . In every house which I happened to enter the mistress of the home was evidently a good American housewife and helpmeet , who had given to the home life that touch of attractiveness which , of course , the bachelor quarters neither had nor could have . The housewives purchase their supplies directly , or through their husbands , from the commissary stores of the Commission . All to whom I spoke agreed that the supplies were excellent , and all but two stated that there was no complaint to be made these two complained that the prices were excessive as compared to the prices in the States . On investigation I did not feel that this complaint was well founded . The married men ate at home . The unmarried men sometimes ate at private boarding houses , or private messes , but more often , judging by the answers of those whom I questioned , at the government canteens or hotels where the meal costs 30 cents to each employee . This 30 cent meal struck me as being as good a meal as we get in the United States at the ordinary hotel in which a 50 cent meal is provided . Three fourths of the men whom I questioned stated that the meals furnished at these government hotels were good , the remaining one fourth that they were not good . I myself took dinner at the La Boca government hotel , no warning whatever having been given of my coming . There were two rooms , as generally in these hotels . In one the employees were allowed to dine without their coats , while in the other they had to put them on . The 30 cent meal included soup , native beef which was good , mashed potatoes , peas , beets , chili con carne , plum pudding , tea , coffee each man having as much of each dish as he desired . On the table there was a bottle of liquid quinine tonic , which two thirds of the guests , as I was informed , used every day . There were neat tablecloths and napkins . The men , who were taking the meal at or about the same time , included railroad men , machinists , shipwrights , and members of the office force . The rooms were clean , comfortable , and airy , with mosquito screens around the outer piazza . I was informed by some of those present that this hotel , and also the other similar hotels , were every Saturday night turned into clubhouses where the American officials , the school teachers , and various employees , appeared , bringing their wives , there being dancing and singing . There was a piano in the room , which I was informed was used for the music on these occasions . My meal was excellent , and two newspaper correspondents who had been on the Isthmus several days informed me that it was precisely like the meals they had been getting elsewhere at other Government hotels . One of the employees was a cousin of one of the Secret Service men who was with me , and he stated that the meals had always been good , but that after a time he grew tired of them because they seemed so much alike . I came to the conclusion that , speaking generally , there was no warrant for complaint about the food . Doubtless it grows monotonous after awhile . Any man accustomed to handling large masses of men knows that some of them , even though otherwise very good men , are sure to grumble about something , and usually about their food . Schoolboys , college boys , and boarders in boarding houses make similar complaints so do soldiers and sailors . On this very trip , on one of the warships , a seaman came to complain to the second watch officer about the quality of the cocoa at the seaman s mess , saying that it was not sweet enough it was pointed out to him that there was sugar on the table and he could always put it in , to which he responded that that was the cook s business and not his I think that the complaint as to the food on the Isthmus has but little more foundation than that of the sailor in question . Moreover , I was given to understand that one real cause of complaint was that at the government hotels no liquor is served , and some of the drinking men , therefore , refused to go to them . The number of men using the government hotels is steadily increasing . Of the nineteen or twenty thousand day laborers employed on the canal , a few hundred are Spaniards . These do excellent work . Their foreman told me that they did twice as well as the West India laborers . They keep healthy and no difficulty is experienced with them in any way . Some Italian laborers are also employed in connection with the drilling . As might be expected , with labor as high priced as at present in the United States , it has not so far proved practicable to get any ordinary laborers from the United States . The American wage workers on the Isthmus are the highly paid skilled mechanics of the types mentioned previously . A steady effort is being made to secure Italians , and especially to procure more Spaniards , because of the very satisfactory results that have come from their employment and their numbers will be increased as far as possible . It has not proved possible , however , to get them in anything like the numbers needed for the work , and from present appearances we shall in the main have to rely , for the ordinary unskilled work , partly upon colored laborers from the West Indies , partly upon Chinese labor . It certainly ought to be unnecessary to point out that the American workingman in the United States has no concern whatever in the question as to whether the rough work on the Isthmus , which is performed by aliens in any event , is done by aliens from one country with a black skin or by aliens from another country with a yellow skin . Our business is to dig the canal as efficiently and as quickly as possible provided always that nothing is done that is inhumane to any laborers , and nothing that interferes with the wages of or lowers the standard of living of our own workmen . Having in view this principle , I have arranged to try several thousand Chinese laborers . This is desirable both because we must try to find out what laborers are most efficient , and , furthermore , because we should not leave ourselves at the mercy of any one type of foreign labor . At present the great bulk of the unskilled labor on the Isthmus is done by West India negroes , chiefly from Jamaica , Barbados , and the other English possessions . One of the governors of the lands in question has shown an unfriendly disposition to our work , and has thrown obstacles in the way of our getting the labor needed and it is highly undesirable to give any outsiders the impression , however ill founded , that they are indispensable and can dictate terms to us . The West India laborers are fairly , but only fairly , satisfactory . Some of the men do very well indeed the better class , who are to be found as foremen , as skilled mechanics , as policemen , are good men and many of the ordinary day laborers are also good . But thousands of those who are brought over under contract at our expense go off into the jungle to live , or loaf around Colon , or work so badly after the first three or four days as to cause a serious diminution of the amount of labor performed on Friday and Saturday of each week . I questioned many of these Jamaica laborers as to the conditions of their work and what , if any , changes they wished . I received many complaints from them , but as regards most of these complaints they themselves contradicted one another . In all cases where the complaint was as to their treatment by any individual it proved , on examination , that this individual was himself a West India man of color , either a policeman , a storekeeper , or an assistant storekeeper . Doubtless there must be many complaints against Americans but those to whom I spoke did not happen to make any such complaint to me . There was no complaint of the housing I saw but one set of quarters for colored laborers which I thought poor , and this was in an old French house . The barracks for unmarried men are roomy , well ventilated , and clean , with canvas bunks for each man , and a kind of false attic at the top , where the trunks and other belongings of the different men are kept . The clothes are hung on clotheslines , nothing being allowed to be kept on the floor . In each of these big rooms there were tables and lamps , and usually a few books or papers , and in almost every room there was a Bible the books being the property of the laborers themselves . The cleanliness of the quarters is secured by daily inspection . The quarters for the married negro laborers were good . They were neatly kept , and in almost every case the men living in them , whose wives or daughters did the cooking for them , were far better satisfied and of a higher grade than the ordinary bachelor negroes . Not only were the quarters in which these negro laborers were living much superior to those in which I am informed they live at home , but they were much superior to the huts to be seen in the jungles of Panama itself , beside the railroad tracks , in which the lower class of native Panamans live , as well as the negro workmen when they leave the employ of the canal and go into the jungles . A single glance at the two sets of buildings is enough to show the great superiority in point of comfort , cleanliness , and healthfulness of the Government houses as compared with the native houses . The negroes generally do their own cooking , the bachelors cooking in sheds provided by the Government and using their own pots . In the different camps there was a wide variation in the character of these cooking sheds . In some , where the camps were completed , the kitchen or cooking sheds , as well as the bathrooms and water closets , were all in excellent trim , while there were board sidewalks leading from building to building . In other camps the kitchens or cook sheds had not been floored , and the sidewalks had not been put down , while in one camp the bath houses were not yet up In each case , however , every effort was being made to hurry on the construction , and I do not believe that the delays had been greater than were inevitable in such work . The laborers are accustomed to do their own cooking but there was much complaint , especially among the bachelors , as to the quantity , and some as to the quality , of the food they got from the commissary department , especially as regards yams . On the other hand , the married men and their wives , and the more advanced among the bachelors , almost invariably expressed themselves as entirely satisfied with their treatment at the commissary stores except that they stated that they generally could not get yams there , and had to purchase them outside . The chief complaint was that the prices were too high . It is unavoidable that the prices should be higher than in their own homes and after careful investigation I came to the conclusion that the chief trouble lay in the fact that the yams , plantains , and the like are rather perishable food , and are very bulky compared to the amount of nourishment they contain , so that it is costly to import them in large quantities and difficult to keep them . Nevertheless , I felt that an effort should be made to secure them a more ample supply of their favorite food , and so directed and I believe that ultimately the Government must itself feed them . I am having this matter looked into . The superintendent having immediate charge of one gang of men at the Colon reservoir stated that he endeavored to get them to substitute beans and other nourishing food for the stringy , watery yams , because the men keep their strength and health better on the more nourishing food . Inasmuch , however , as they are accustomed to yams it is difficult to get them to eat the more strengthening food , and some time elapses before they grow accustomed to it . At this reservoir there has been a curious experience . It is off in the jungle by itself at the end of a couple of miles of a little toy railroad . In order to get the laborers there , they were given free food and of course free lodgings and yet it proved difficult to keep them , because they wished to be where they could reach the dramshop and places of amusement . I was struck by the superior comfort and respectability of the lives of the married men . It would , in my opinion , be a most admirable thing if a much larger number of the men had their wives , for with their advent all complaints about the food and cooking are almost sure to cease . I had an interview with Mallet , the British consul , to find out if there was any just cause for complaint as to the treatment of the West India negroes . He informed me most emphatically that there was not , and authorized me to give his statement publicity . He said that not only was the condition of the laborers far better than had been the case under the old French Company , but that year by year the condition was improving under our own regime . He stated that complaints were continually brought to him , and that he always investigated them and that for the last six months he had failed to find a single complaint of a serious nature that contained any justification whatever . One of the greatest needs at present is to provide amusements both for the white men and the black . The Young Men s Christian Association is trying to do good work and should be in every way encouraged . But the Government should do the main work . I have specifically called the attention of the Commission to this matter , and something has been accomplished already . Anything done for the welfare of the men adds to their efficiency and money devoted to that purpose is , therefore , properly to be considered as spent in building the canal . It is imperatively necessary to provide ample recreation and amusement if the men are to be kept well and healthy . I call the special attention of Congress to this need . This gathering , distributing , and caring for the great force of laborers is one of the giant features of the work . That friction will from time to time occur in connection therewith is inevitable . The astonishing thing is that the work has been performed so well and that the machinery runs so smoothly . From my own experience I am able to say that more care had been exercised in housing , feeding , and generally paying heed to the needs of the skilled mechanics and ordinary laborers in the work on this canal than is the case in the construction of new railroads or in any other similar private or public work in the United States proper and it is the testimony of all people competent to speak that on no other similar work anywhere in the Tropics indeed , as far as I know , anywhere else has there been such forethought and such success achieved in providing for the needs of the men who do the work . I have now dealt with the hygienic conditions which make it possible to employ a great force of laborers , and with the task of gathering , housing , and feeding these laborers . There remains to consider the actual work which has to be done the work because of which these laborers are gathered together the work of constructing the canal . This is under the direct control of the Chief Engineer , Stevens , who has already shown admirable results , and whom we can safely trust to achieve similar results in the future . Our people found on the Isthmus a certain amount of old French material and equipment which could be used . Some of it , in addition , could be sold as scrap iron . Some could be used for furnishing the foundation for filling in . For much no possible use could be devised that would not cost more than it would bring in . The work is now going on with a vigor and efficiency pleasant to witness . The three big problems of the canal are the La Boca dams , the Gatun dam , and the Culebra cut . The Culebra cut must be made , anyhow but of course changes as to the dams , or at least as to the locks adjacent to the dams , may still occur . The La Boca dams offer no particular problem , the bottom material being so good that there is a practical certainty , not merely as to what can be achieved , but as to the time of achievement . The Gatun dam offers the most serious problem which we have to solve and yet the ablest men on the Isthmus believe that this problem is certain of solution along the lines proposed although , of course , it necessitates great toil , energy , and intelligence , and although equally , of course , there will be some little risk in connection with the work . The risk arises from the fact that some of the material near the bottom is not so good as could be desired . If the huge earth dam now contemplated is thrown across from one foothill to the other we will have what is practically a low , broad , mountain ridge behind which will rise the inland lake . This artificial mountain will probably show less seepage , that is , will have greater restraining capacity than the average natural mountain range . The exact locality of the locks at this dam as at the other dams is now being determined . In April next Secretary Taft , with three of the ablest engineers of the country Noble , Stearns , and Ripley will visit the Isthmus , and the three engineers will make the final and conclusive examinations as to the exact site for each lock . Meanwhile the work is going ahead without a break . The Culebra cut does not offer such great risks that is , the damage liable to occur from occasional land slips will not represent what may be called major disasters . The work will merely call for intelligence , perseverance , and executive capacity . It is , however , the work upon which most labor will have to be spent . The dams will be composed of the earth taken out of the cut and very possibly the building of the locks and dams will taken even longer than the cutting in Culebra itself . The main work is now being done in the Culebra cut . It was striking and impressive to see the huge steam shovels in full play , the dumping trains carrying away the rock and earth they dislodged . The implements of French excavating machinery , which often stand a little way from the line of work , though of excellent construction , look like the veriest toys when compared with these new steam shovels , just as the French dumping cars seem like toy cars when compared with the long trains of huge cars , dumped by steam plows , which are now in use . This represents the enormous advance that has been made in machinery during the past quarter of a century . No doubt a quarter of a century hence this new machinery , of which we are now so proud , will similarly seem out of date , but it is certainly serving its purpose well now . The old French cars had to be entirely discarded . We still have in use a few of the more modern , but not most modern , cars , which hold but twelve yards of earth . They can be employed on certain lines with sharp curves . But the recent cars hold from twenty five to thirty yards apiece , and instead of the old clumsy methods of unloading them , a steam plow is drawn from end to end of the whole vestibuled train , thus immensely economizing labor . In the rainy season the steam shovels can do but little in dirt , but they work steadily in rock and in the harder ground . There were some twenty five at work during the time I was on the Isthmus , and their tremendous power and efficiency were most impressive . As soon as the type of canal was decided this work began in good earnest . The rainy season will shortly be over and then there will be an immense increase in the amount taken out but even during the last three months , in the rainy season , steady progress is shown by the figures In August , 242 , 000 cubic yards in September , 291 , 000 cubic yards , and in October , 325 , 000 cubic yards . In October new records were established for the output of individual shovels as well as for the tonnage haul of individual locomotives . I hope to see the growth of a healthy spirit of emulation between the different shovel and locomotive crews , just such a spirit as has grown on our battle ships between the different gun crews in matters of marksmanship . Passing through the cut the amount of new work can be seen at a glance . In one place the entire side of a hill had been taken out recently by twenty seven tons of dynamite , which were exploded at one blast . At another place I was given a Presidential salute of twenty one charges of dynamite . On the top notch of the Culebra cut the prism is now as wide as it will be all told , the canal bed at this point has now been sunk about two hundred feet below what it originally was . It will have to be sunk about one hundred and thirty feet farther . Throughout the cut the drilling , blasting , shoveling , and hauling are going on with constantly increasing energy , the huge shovels being pressed up , as if they were mountain howitzers , into the most unlikely looking places , where they eat their way into the hillsides . The most advanced methods , not only in construction , but in railroad management , have been applied in the Zone , with corresponding economies in time and cost . This has been shown in the handling of the tonnage from ships into cars , and from cars into ships on the Panama Railroad , where , thanks largely to the efficiency of General Manager Bierd , the saving in time and cost , has been noteworthy . My examination tended to show that some of the departments had doubtless necessarily become overdeveloped , and could now be reduced or subordinated without impairment of efficiency and with a saving of cost . The Chairman of the Commission , Shonts , has all matters of this kind constantly in view , and is now reorganizing the government of the Zone , so as to make the form of administration both more flexible and less expensive , subordinating everything to direct efficiency with a view to the work of the Canal Commission . From time to time changes of this kind will undoubtedly have to be made , for it must be remembered that in this giant work of construction , it is continually necessary to develop departments or bureaus , which are vital for the time being , but which soon become useless just as it will be continually necessary to put up buildings , and even to erect towns , which in ten years will once more give place to jungle , or will then be at the bottom of the great lakes at the ends of the canal . It is not only natural , but inevitable , that a work as gigantic as this which has been undertaken on the Isthmus should arouse every species of hostility and criticism . The conditions are so new and so trying , and the work so vast , that it would be absolutely out of the question that mistakes should not be made . Checks will occur . Unforeseen difficulties will arise . From time to time seemingly well settled plans will have to be changed . At present twenty five thousand men are engaged on the task . After a while the number will be doubled . In such a multitude it is inevitable that there should be here and there a scoundrel . Very many of the poorer class of laborers lack the mental development to protect themselves against either the rascality of others or their own folly , and it is not possible for human wisdom to devise a plan by which they can invariably be protected . In a place which has been for ages a by word for unhealthfulness , and with so large a congregation of strangers suddenly put down and set to hard work there will now and then be outbreaks of disease . There will now and then be shortcomings in administration there will be unlooked for accidents to delay the excavation of the cut or the building of the dams and locks . Each such incident will be entirely natural , and , even though serious , no one of them will mean more than a little extra delay or trouble . Yet each , when discovered by sensation mongers and retailed to timid folk of little faith , will serve as an excuse for the belief that the whole work is being badly managed . Experiments will continually be tried in housing , in hygiene , in street repairing , in dredging , and in digging earth and rock . Now and then an experiment will be a failure and among those who hear of it , a certain proportion of doubting Thomases will at once believe that the whole work is a failure . Doubtless here and there some minor rascality will be uncovered but as to this , I have to say that after the most painstaking inquiry I have been unable to find a single reputable person who had so much as heard of any serious accusations affecting the honesty of the Commission or of any responsible officer under it . I append a letter dealing with the most serious charge , that of the ownership of lots in Colon the charge was not advanced by a reputable man , and is utterly baseless . It is not too much to say that the whole atmosphere of the Commission breathes honesty as it breathes efficiency and energy . Above all , the work has been kept absolutely clear of politics . I have never heard even a suggestion of spoils politics in connection with it . I have investigated every complaint brought to me for which there seemed to be any shadow of foundation . In two or three cases , all of which I have indicated in the course of this message , I came to the conclusion that there was foundation for the complaint , and that the methods of the Commission in the respect complained of could be bettered . In the other instances the complaints proved absolutely baseless , save in two or three instances where they referred to mistakes which the Commission had already itself found out and corrected . So much for honest criticism . There remains an immense amount of as reckless slander as has ever been published . Where the slanderers are of foreign origin I have no concern with them . Where they are Americans , I feel for them the heartiest contempt and indignation because , in a spirit of wanton dishonesty and malice , they are trying to interfere with , and hamper the execution of , the greatest work of the kind ever attempted , and are seeking to bring to naught the efforts of their countrymen to put to the credit of America one of the giant feats of the ages . The outrageous accusations of these slanderers constitute a gross libel upon a body of public servants who , for trained intelligence , expert ability , high character and devotion to duty , have never been excelled anywhere . There is not a man among those directing the work on the Isthmus who has obtained his position on any other basis than merit alone , and not one who has used his position in any way for his own personal or pecuniary advantage . After most careful consideration we have decided to let out most of the work by contract , if we can come to satisfactory terms with the contractors . The whole work is of a kind suited to the peculiar genius of our people and our people have developed the type of contractor best fitted to grapple with it . It is , of course , much better to do the work in large part by contract than to do it all by the Government , provided it is possible on the one hand to secure to the contractor a sufficient remuneration to make it worth while for responsible contractors of the best kind to undertake the work and provided on the other hand it can be done on terms which will not give an excessive profit to the contractor at the expense of the Government . After much consideration the plan already promulgated by the Secretary of War was adopted . This plan in its essential features was drafted , after careful and thorough study and consideration , by the Chief Engineer , Stevens , who , while in the employment of Hill , the president of the Great Northern Railroad , had personal experience of this very type of contract . Stevens then submitted the plan to the Chairman of the Commission , Shouts , who went carefully over it with Rogers , the legal adviser of the Commission , to see that all legal difficulties were met . He then submitted copies of the plan to both Secretary Taft and myself . Secretary Taft submitted it to some of the best counsel at the New York bar , and afterwards I went over it very carefully with Taft and Shouts , and we laid the plan in its general features before Root . My conclusion is that it combines the maximum of advantage with the minimum of disadvantage . Under it a premium will be put upon the speedy and economical construction of the canal , and a penalty imposed on delay and waste . The plan as promulgated is tentative doubtless it will have to be changed in some respects before we can come to a satisfactory agreement with responsible contractors perhaps even after the bids have been received and of course it is possible that we cannot come to an agreement , in which case the Government will do the work itself . Meanwhile the work on the Isthmus is progressing steadily and without any let up . A seven headed commission is , of course , a clumsy executive instrument . We should have but one commissioner , with such heads of departments and other officers under him as we may find necessary . We should be expressly permitted to employ the best engineers in the country as consulting engineers . I accompany this paper with a map showing substantially what the canal will be like when it is finished . When the Culebra cut has been made and the dams built if they are built as at present proposed there will then be at both the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal , two great fresh water lakes , connected by a broad channel running at the bottom of a ravine , across the backbone of the Western Hemisphere . Those best informed believe that the work will be completed in about eight years but it is never save to prophesy about such a work as this , especially in the Tropics . I am informed that the representatives of the commercial clubs of four cities Boston , Chicago , Cincinnati , and Louis the membership of which includes most of the leading business men of those cities , expect to visit the Isthmus for the purpose of examining the work of construction of the canal . I am glad to hear it , and I shall direct that every facility be given them to see all that is to be seen in the work which the Government is doing . Such interest as a visit like this would indicate will have a good effect upon the men who are doing the work , on one hand , while on the other hand it will offer as witnesses of the exact conditions men whose experiences as business men and whose impartiality will make the result of their observations of value to the country as a whole . Of the success of the enterprise I am as well convinced as one can be of any enterprise that is human . It is a stupendous work upon which our fellow countrymen are engaged down there on the Isthmus , and while we should hold them to a strict accountability for the way in which they perform it , we should yet recognize , with frank generosity , the epic nature of the task on which they are engaged and its world wide importance . They are doing something which will redound immeasurably to the credit of America , which will benefit all the world , and which will last for ages to come . Under Shonts and Stevens and Doctor Gorgas this work has started with every omen of good fortune . They and their worthy associates , from the highest to the lowest , are entitled to the same credit that we would give to the picked men of a victorious army for this conquest of peace will , in its great and far reaching effect , stand as among the greatest conquests , whether of peace or of war , which have ever been won by any of the peoples of mankind . A badge is to be given to every American citizen who for a specified time has taken part in this work for participation in it will hereafter be held to reflect honor upon the man participating just as it reflects honor upon a soldier to have belonged to a mighty army in a great war for righteousness . Our fellow countrymen on the Isthmus are working for our interest and for the national renown in the same spirit and with the same efficiency that the men of the Army and Navy work I n time of war . It behooves us in our turn to do all we can to hold up their hands and to aid them in every way to bring their great work to a triumphant conclusion .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives The financial standing of the Nation at the present time is excellent , and the financial management of the Nation s interests by the Government during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results . But our currency system is imperfect , and it is earnestly to be hoped that the Currency Commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects . During the period from July 1 , 1901 , to September 30 , 1908 , there was an increase in the amount of money in circulation of 902 , 991 , 399 . The increase in the per capita during this period was 7 . 06 . Within this time there were several occasions when it was necessary for the Treasury Department to come to the relief of the money market by purchases or redemptions of United States bonds by increasing deposits in national banks by stimulating additional issues of national bank notes , and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold . Our imperfect currency system has made these proceedings necessary , and they were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 1907 immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief . By the middle of November the available working balance in the Treasury had been reduced to approximately 5 , 000 , 000 . Clearing house associations throughout the country had been obliged to resort to the expedient of issuing clearing house certificates , to be used as money . In this emergency it was determined to invite subscriptions for 50 , 000 , 000 Panama Canal bonds , and 100 , 000 , 000 three per cent certificates of indebtedness authorized by the act of June 13 , 1898 . It was proposed to re deposit in the national banks the proceeds of these issues , and to permit their use as a basis for additional circulating notes of national banks . The moral effect of this procedure was so great that it was necessary to issue only 24 , 631 , 980 of the Panama Canal bonds and 15 , 436 , 500 of the certificates of indebtedness . During the period from July 1 , 1901 , to September 30 , 1908 , the balance between the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the Government showed a surplus in the four years 1902 , 1903 , 1906 and 1907 , and a deficit in the years 1904 , 1905 , 1908 and a fractional part of the fiscal year 1909 . The net result was a surplus of 99 , 283 , 413 . 54 . The financial operations of the Government during this period , based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures , resulted in a net reduction of the interest bearing debt of the United States from 987 , 141 , 040 to 897 , 253 , 990 , notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama Canal bonds amounting in the aggregate to 54 , 631 , 980 , and an issue of three per cent certificates of indebtedness under the act of June 13 , 1998 , amounting to 15 , 436 , 500 . Refunding operations of the Treasury Department under the act of March 14 , 1900 , resulted in the conversion into two per cent consols of 1930 of 200 , 309 , 400 bonds bearing higher rates of interest . A decrease of 8 , 687 , 956 in the annual interest charge resulted from these operations . In short , during the seven years and three months there has been a net surplus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures , a reduction of the interest bearing debt by ninety millions , in spite of the extraordinary expense of the Panama Canal , and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest charge . This is an exceedingly satisfactory showing , especially in view of the fact that during this period the Nation has never hesitated to undertake any expenditure that it regarded as necessary . There have been no new taxes and no increase of taxes on the contrary , some taxes have been taken off there has been a reduction of taxation . As regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business , and especially the railroad , I can only repeat what I have already again and again said in my messages to the Congress , I believe that under the interstate clause of the Constitution the United States has complete and paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce , and I believe that the National Government alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from , and to do justice to , the great corporations which are the most important factors in modern business . I believe that it is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sherman anti trust law , because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly and unequally , and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good . I strongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all combinations there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are in the interest of the public , but shall at the same time give to some agency of the National Government full power of control and supervision over them . One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire publicity in all matters which the public has a right to know , and furthermore , the power , not by judicial but by executive action , to prevent or put a stop to every form of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing . The railways of the country should be put completely under the Interstate Commerce Commission and removed from the domain of the anti trust law . The power of the Commission should be made thoroughgoing , so that it could exercise complete supervision and control over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates . As regards rates , at least , this power should be summary . The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recent legislation . Power to make combinations and traffic agreements should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads , the permission of the Commission being first gained and the combination or agreement being published in all its details . In the interest of the public the representatives of the public should have complete power to see that the railroads do their duty by the public , and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised so as to see that no injustice is done to the railroads . The shareholders , the employees and the shippers all have interests that must be guarded . It is to the interest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed , and that there should be no improper issuance of securities . The guiding intelligences necessary for the successful building and successful management of railroads should receive ample remuneration but no man should be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of fraudulent over capitalization and kindred stock gambling performances there must be no defrauding of investors , oppression of the farmers and business men who ship freight , or callous disregard of the rights and needs of the employees . In addition to this the interests of the shareholders , of the employees , and of the shippers should all be guarded as against one another . To give any one of them undue and improper consideration is to do injustice to the others . Rates must be made as low as is compatible with giving proper returns to all the employees of the railroad , from the highest to the lowest , and proper returns to the shareholders but they must not , for instance , be reduced in such fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of the employees or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders . Telegraph and telephone companies engaged in interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission . It is very earnestly to be wished that our people , through their representatives , should act in this matter . It is hard to say whether most damage to the country at large would come from entire failure on the part of the public to supervise and control the actions of the great corporations , or from the exercise of the necessary governmental power in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations . Both the preachers of an unrestricted individualism , and the preachers of an oppression which would deny to able men of business the just reward of their initiative and business sagacity , are advocating policies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the whole country . To permit every lawless capitalist , every law defying corporation , to take any action , no matter how iniquitous , in the effort to secure an improper profit and to build up privilege , would be ruinous to the Republic and would mark the abandonment of the effort to secure in the industrial world the spirit of democratic fair dealing . On the other hand , to attack these wrongs in that spirit of demagogy which can see wrong only when committed by the man of wealth , and is dumb and blind in the presence of wrong committed against men of property or by men of no property , is exactly as evil as corruptly to defend the wrongdoing of men of wealth . The war we wage must be waged against misconduct , against wrongdoing wherever it is found and we must stand heartily for the rights of every decent man , whether he be a man of great wealth or a man who earns his livelihood as a wage worker or a tiller of the soil . It is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon individual initiative and individual capacity , and an ample reward for the great directing intelligences alone competent to manage the great business operations of to day . It is well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the reactionary the worst enemy of order , so the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth , and the men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from the demagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to and oppress honest business men , honest men of wealth for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily invites a violent reaction against the cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds . In point of danger to the Nation there is nothing to choose between on the one hand the corruptionist , the bribe giver , the bribe taker , the man who employs his great talent to swindle his fellow citizens on a large scale , and , on the other hand , the preacher of class hatred , the man who , whether from ignorance or from willingness to sacrifice his country to his ambition , persuades well meaning but wrong headed men to try to destroy the instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests . Let each group of men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that group is itself most liable . Too often we see the business community in a spirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore the effort to hold to account under the law the wealthy men who in their management of great corporations , whether railroads , street railways , or other industrial enterprises , have behaved in a way that revolts the conscience of the plain , decent people . Such an attitude can not be condemned too severely , for men of property should recognize that they jeopardize the rights of property when they fail heartily to join in the effort to do away with the abuses of wealth . On the other hand , those who advocate proper control on behalf of the public , through the State , of these great corporations , and of the wealth engaged on a giant scale in business operations , must ever keep in mind that unless they do scrupulous justice to the corporation , unless they permit ample profit , and cordially encourage capable men of business so long as they act with honesty , they are striking at the root of our national well being for in the long run , under the mere pressure of material distress , the people as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an unrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the State so drastic and so foolish , conceived in a spirit of such unreasonable and narrow hostility to wealth , as to prevent business operations from being profitable , and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire business community , and ultimately upon the entire body of citizens . The opposition to Government control of these great corporations makes its most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine of State s rights . Of course there are many sincere men who now believe in unrestricted individualism in business , just as there were formerly many sincere men who believed in slavery that is , in the unrestricted right of an individual to own another individual . These men do not by themselves have great weight , however . The effective fight against adequate Government control and supervision of individual , and especially of corporate , wealth engaged in interstate business is chiefly done under cover and especially under cover of an appeal to State s rights . It is not at all infrequent to read in the same speech a denunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and defiant of both the public welfare and law of the land , and a denunciation of centralization in the Central Government of the power to deal with this centralized and organized wealth . Of course the policy set forth in such twin denunciations amounts to absolutely nothing , for the first half is nullified by the second half . The chief reason , among the many sound and compelling reasons , that led to the formation of the National Government was the absolute need that the Union , and not the several States , should deal with interstate and foreign commerce and the power to deal with interstate commerce was granted absolutely and plenarily to the Central Government and was exercised completely as regards the only instruments of interstate commerce known in those days the waterways , the highroads , as well as the partnerships of individuals who then conducted all of what business there was . Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads and the great corporation has supplanted the mass of small partnerships or individuals . The proposal to make the National Government supreme over , and therefore to give it complete control over , the railroads and other instruments of interstate commerce is merely a proposal to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes , if not the prime purpose , for which the Constitution was rounded . It does not represent centralization . It represents merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralization has already come in business . If this irresponsible outside business power is to be controlled in the interest of the general public it can only be controlled in one way by giving adequate power of control to the one sovereignty capable of exercising such power the National Government . Forty or fifty separate state governments can not exercise that power over corporations doing business in most or all of them first , because they absolutely lack the authority to deal with interstate business in any form and second , because of the inevitable conflict of authority sure to arise in the effort to enforce different kinds of state regulation , often inconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive in themselves . Such divided authority can not regulate commerce with wisdom and effect . The Central Government is the only power which , without oppression , can nevertheless thoroughly and adequately control and supervise the large corporations . To abandon the effort for National control means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render likely continual bursts of action by State legislatures , which can not achieve the purpose sought for , but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on the public . I believe that the more farsighted corporations are themselves coming to recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayed during the last few years to regulation and control by the National Government of combinations engaged in interstate business . The truth is that we who believe in this movement of asserting and exercising a genuine control , in the public interest , over these great corporations have to contend against two sets of enemies , who , though nominally opposed to one another , are really allies in preventing a proper solution of the problem . There are , first , the big corporation men , and the extreme individualists among business men , who genuinely believe in utterly unregulated business that is , in the reign of plutocracy and , second , the men who , being blind to the economic movements of the day , believe in a movement of repression rather than of regulation of corporations , and who denounce both the power of the railroads and the exercise of the Federal power which alone can really control the railroads . Those who believe in efficient national control , on the other hand , do not in the least object to combinations do not in the least object to concentration in business administration . On the contrary , they favor both , with the all important proviso that there shall be such publicity about their workings , and such thoroughgoing control over them , as to insure their being in the interest , and not against the interest , of the general public . We do not object to the concentration of wealth and administration but we do believe in the distribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners , and in securing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administration . We believe that with concentration in administration there can come both be advantage of a larger ownership and of a more equitable distribution of profits , and at the same time a better service to the commonwealth . We believe that the administration should be for the benefit of the many and that greed and rascality , practiced on a large scale , should be punished as relentlessly as if practiced on a small scale . We do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solved by any short and easy method . The solution will come only by pressing various concurrent remedies . Some of these remedies must lie outside the domain of all government . Some must lie outside the domain of the Federal Government . But there is legislation which the Federal Government alone can enact and which is absolutely vital in order to secure the attainment of our purpose . Many laws are needed . There should be regulation by the National Government of the great interstate corporations , including a simple method of account keeping , publicity , supervision of the issue securities , abolition of rebates , and of special privileges . There should be short time franchises for all corporations engaged in public business including the corporations which get power from water rights . There should be National as well as State guardianship of mines and forests . The labor legislation hereinafter referred to should concurrently be enacted into law . To accomplish this , means of course a certain increase in the use of not the creation of power , by the Central Government . The power already exists it does not have to be created the only question is whether it shall be used or left idle and meanwhile the corporations over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain idle . Let those who object to this increase in the use of the only power available , the national power , be frank , and admit openly that they propose to abandon any effort to control the great business corporations and to exercise supervision over the accumulation and distribution of wealth for such supervision and control can only come through this particular kind of increase of power . We no more believe in that empiricism which demand , absolutely unrestrained individualism than we do in that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialism which would destroy all individual initiative and would ruin the country with a completeness that not even an unrestrained individualism itself could achieve . The danger to American democracy lies not in the least in the concentration of administrative power in responsible and accountable hands . It lies in having the power insufficiently concentrated , so that no one can be held responsible to the people for its use . Concentrated power is palpable , visible , responsible , easily reached , quickly held to account . Power scattered through many administrators , many legislators , many men who work behind and through legislators and administrators , is impalpable , is unseen , is irresponsible , can not be reached , can not be held to account . Democracy is in peril wherever the administration of political power is scattered among a variety of men who work in secret , whose very names are unknown to the common people . It is not in peril from any man who derives authority from the people , who exercises it in sight of the people , and who is from time to time compelled to give an account of its exercise to the people . There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the wage worker to which I should like to draw your attention , but an exhaustive discussion of the problem in all its aspects is not now necessary . This administration is nearing its end and , moreover , under our form of government the solution of the problem depends upon the action of the States as much as upon the action of the Nation . Nevertheless , there are certain considerations which I wish to set before you , because I hope that our people will more and more keep them in mind . A blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reform of abuses and for the readjustment of society to modern industrial conditions represents not true conservatism , but an incitement to the wildest radicalism for wise radicalism and wise conservatism go hand in hand , one bent on progress , the other bent on seeing that no change is made unless in the right direction . I believe in a steady effort , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady efforts in many different directions , to bring about a condition of affairs under which the men who work with hand or with brain , the laborers , the superintendents , the men who produce for the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced , shall own a far greater share than at present of the wealth they produce , and be enabled to invest it in the tools and instruments by which all work is carried on . As far as possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advantages conferred by machinery , organization , and division of labor , accompanied by an effort to bring about a larger share in the ownership by wage worker of railway , mill and factory . In farming , this simply means that we wish to see the farmer own his own land we do not wish to see the farms so large that they become the property of absentee landlords who farm them by tenants , nor yet so small that the farmer becomes like a European peasant . Again , the depositors in our savings banks now number over one tenth of our entire population . These are all capitalists , who through the savings banks loan their money to the workers that is , in many cases to themselves to carry on their various industries . The more we increase their number , the more we introduce the principles of cooperation into our industry . Every increase in the number of small stockholders in corporations is a good thing , for the same reasons and where the employees are the stockholders the result is particularly good . Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that can be accomplished by legislation but legislation can do a good deal . Postal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep their savings in absolute safety . The regulation of the national highways must be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice . Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make it far safer than at present for the man of small means to invest his money in stocks . There must be prohibition of child labor , diminution of woman labor , shortening of hours of all mechanical labor stock watering should be prohibited , and stock gambling so far as is possible discouraged . There should be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes . Industrial education should be encouraged . As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man . We should put a premium upon thrift , hard work , and business energy but these qualities cease to be the main factors in accumulating a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where it would be seriously affected by any inheritance tax such as I propose . It is eminently right that the Nation should fix the terms upon which the great fortunes are inherited . They rarely do good and they often do harm to those who inherit them in their entirety . The above is the merest sketch , hardly even a sketch in outline , of the reforms for which we should work . But there is one matter with which the Congress should deal at this session . There should no longer be any paltering with the question of taking care of the wage workers who , under our present industrial system , become killed , crippled , or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business . The majority of wageworkers must have their rights secured for them by State action but the National Government should legislate in thoroughgoing and far reaching fashion not only for all employees of the National Government , but for all persons engaged in interstate commerce . The object sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree , as far as those killed or crippled are concerned , by proper employers liability laws . As far as concerns those who have been worn out , I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old age pensions have been taken in many of our private industries . These may be indefinitely extended through voluntary association and contributory schemes , or through the agency of savings banks , as under the recent Massachusetts plan . To strengthen these practical measures should be our immediate duty it is not at present necessary to consider the larger and more general governmental schemes that most European governments have found themselves obliged to adopt . Our present system , or rather no system , works dreadful wrong , and is of benefit to only one class of people the lawyers . When a workman is injured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit , but the certainty of relief through immediate administrative action . The number of accidents which result in the death or crippling of wageworkers , in the Union at large , is simply appalling in a very few years it runs up a total far in excess of the aggregate of the dead and wounded in any modern war . No academic theory about freedom of contract or constitutional liberty to contract should be permitted to interfere with this and similar movements . Progress in civilization has everywhere meant a limitation and regulation of contract . I call your especial attention to the bulletin of the Bureau of Labor which gives a statement of the methods of treating the unemployed in European countries , as this is a subject which in Germany , for instance , is treated in connection with making provision for worn out and crippled workmen . Pending a thoroughgoing investigation and action there is certain legislation which should be enacted at once . The law , passed at the last session of the Congress , granting compensation to certain classes of employees of the Government , should be extended to include all employees of the Government and should be made more liberal in its terms . There is no good ground for the distinction made in the law between those engaged in hazardous occupations and those not so engaged . If a man is injured or killed in any line of work , it was hazardous in his case . Whether 1 per cent or 10 per cent of those following a given occupation actually suffer injury or death ought not to have any bearing on the question of their receiving compensation . It is a grim logic which says to an injured employee or to the dependents of one killed that he or they are entitled to no compensation because very few people other than he have been injured or killed in that occupation . Perhaps one of the most striking omissions in the law is that it does not embrace peace officers and others whose lives may be sacrificed in enforcing the laws of the United States . The terms of the act providing compensation should be made more liberal than in the present act . A year s compensation is not adequate for a wage earner s family in the event of his death by accident in the course of his employment . And in the event of death occurring , say , ten or eleven months after the accident , the family would only receive as compensation the equivalent of one or two months earnings . In this respect the generosity of the United States towards its employees compares most unfavorably with that of every country in Europe even the poorest . The terms of the act are also a hardship in prohibiting payment in cases where the accident is in any way due to the negligence of the employee . It is inevitable that daily familiarity with danger will lead men to take chances that can be construed into negligence . So well is this recognized that in practically all countries in the civilized world , except the United States , only a great degree of negligence acts as a bar to securing compensation . Probably in no other respect is our legislation , both State and National , so far behind practically the entire civilized world as in the matter of liability and compensation for accidents in industry . It is humiliating that at European international congresses on accidents the United States should be singled out as the most belated among the nations in respect to employers liability legislation . This Government is itself a large employer of labor , and in its dealings with its employees it should set a standard in this country which would place it on a par with the most progressive countries in Europe . The laws of the United States in this respect and the laws of European countries have been summarized in a recent Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor , and no American who reads this summary can fail to be struck by the great contrast between our practices and theirs a contrast not in any sense to our credit . The Congress should without further delay pass a model employers liability law for the District of Columbia . The employers liability act recently declared unconstitutional , on account of apparently including in its provisions employees engaged in intrastate commerce as well as those engaged in interstate commerce , has been held by the local courts to be still in effect so far as its provisions apply to District of Columbia . There should be no ambiguity on this point . If there is any doubt on the subject , the law should be reenacted with special reference to the District of Columbia . This act , however , applies only to employees of common carriers . In all other occupations the liability law of the District is the old common law . The severity and injustice of the common law in this matter has been in some degree or another modified in the majority of our States , and the only jurisdiction under the exclusive control of the Congress should be ahead and not behind the States of the Union in this respect . A comprehensive employers liability law should be passed for the District of Columbia . I renew my recommendation made in a previous message that half holidays be granted during summer to all wageworkers in Government employ . I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entire work being carried on by the Government the present law should be amended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present wording of the act seems to exclude . I most earnestly urge upon the Congress the duty of increasing the totally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges . On the whole there is no body of public servants who do as valuable work , nor whose moneyed reward is so inadequate compared to their work . Beginning with the Supreme Court , the Judges should have their salaries doubled . It is not befitting the dignity of the Nation that its most honored public servants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn in private life that the performance of public service by them implies an exceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice . It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration of justice , and which operate with peculiar severity against persons of small means , and favor only the very criminals whom it is most desirable to punish . These long delays in the final decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil and a remedy should be devised . Much of this intolerable delay is due to improper regard paid to technicalities which are a mere hindrance to justice . In some noted recent cases this over regard for technicalities has resulted in a striking denial of justice , and flagrant wrong to the body politic . At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent and sweeping attack upon the entire judiciary of the country , an attack couched in such terms as to include the most upright , honest and broad minded judges , no less than those of narrower mind and more restricted outlook . It was the kind of attack admirably fitted to prevent any successful attempt to reform abuses of the judiciary , because it gave the champions of the unjust judge their eagerly desired opportunity to shift their ground into a championship of just judges who were unjustly assailed . Last year , before the House Committee on the Judiciary , these same labor leaders formulated their demands , specifying the bill that contained them , refusing all compromise , stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing . They insisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no injunction should issue except to protect a property right , and specifically provided that the right to carry on business should not be construed as a property right and in a second provision their bill made legal in a labor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons that would not have been unlawful if done by a single person . In other words . this bill legalized blacklisting and boycotting in every form , legalizing , for instance , those forms of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike commission so unreservedly condemned while the right to carry on a business was explicitly taken out from under that protection which the law throws over property . The demand was made that there should be trial by jury in contempt cases , thereby most seriously impairing the authority of the courts . All this represented a course of policy which , if carried out , would mean the enthronement of class privilege in its crudest and most brutal form , and the destruction of one of the most essential functions of the judiciary in all civilized lands . The violence of the crusade for this legislation , and its complete failure , illustrate two truths which it is essential our people should learn . In the first place , they ought to teach the workingman , the laborer , the wageworker , that by demanding what is improper and impossible he plays into the hands of his foes . Such a crude and vicious attack upon the courts , even if it were temporarily successful , would inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would band the great mass of citizens together , forcing them to stand by all the judges , competent and incompetent alike , rather than to see the wheels of justice stopped . A movement of this kind can ultimately result in nothing but damage to those in whose behalf it is nominally undertaken . This is a most healthy truth , which it is wise for all our people to learn . Any movement based on that class hatred which at times assumes the name of class consciousness is certain ultimately to fail , and if it temporarily succeeds , to do far reaching damage . Class consciousness , where it is merely another name for the odious vice of class selfishness , is equally noxious whether in an employer s association or in a workingman s association . The movement in question was one in which the appeal was made to all workingmen to vote primarily , not as American citizens , but as individuals of a certain class in society . Such an appeal in the first place revolts the more high minded and far sighted among the persons to whom it is addressed , and in the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism among all other classes of citizens , whom it therefore tends to unite against the very organization on whose behalf it is issued . The result is therefore unfortunate from every standpoint . This healthy truth , by the way , will be learned by the socialists if they ever succeed in establishing in this country an important national party based on such class consciousness and selfish class interest . The wageworkers , the workingmen , the laboring men of the country , by the way in which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their votes in response to an appeal to class hatred , have emphasized their sound patriotism and Americanism . The whole country has cause to fell pride in this attitude of sturdy independence , in this uncompromising insistence upon acting simply as good citizens , as good Americans , without regard to fancied and improper class interests . Such an attitude is an object lesson in good citizenship to the entire nation . But the extreme reactionaries , the persons who blind themselves to the wrongs now and then committed by the courts on laboring men , should also think seriously as to what such a movement as this portends . The judges who have shown themselves able and willing effectively to check the dishonest activity of the very rich man who works iniquity by the mismanagement of corporations , who have shown themselves alert to do justice to the wageworker , and sympathetic with the needs of the mass of our people , so that the dweller in the tenement houses , the man who practices a dangerous trade , the man who is crushed by excessive hours of labor , feel that their needs are understood by the courts these judges are the real bulwark of the courts these judges , the judges of the stamp of the president elect , who have been fearless in opposing labor when it has gone wrong , but fearless also in holding to strict account corporations that work iniquity , and far sighted in seeing that the workingman gets his rights , are the men of all others to whom we owe it that the appeal for such violent and mistaken legislation has fallen on deaf ears , that the agitation for its passage proved to be without substantial basis . The courts are jeopardized primarily by the action of those Federal and State judges who show inability or unwillingness to put a stop to the wrongdoing of very rich men under modern industrial conditions , and inability or unwillingness to give relief to men of small means or wageworkers who are crushed down by these modern industrial conditions who , in other words , fail to understand and apply the needed remedies for the new wrongs produced by the new and highly complex social and industrial civilization which has grown up in the last half century . The rapid changes in our social and industrial life which have attended this rapid growth have made it necessary that , in applying to concrete cases the great rule of right laid down in our Constitution , there should be a full understanding and appreciation of the new conditions to which the rules are to be applied . What would have been an infringement upon liberty half a century ago may be the necessary safeguard of liberty to day . What would have been an injury to property then may be necessary to the enjoyment of property now . Every judicial decision involves two terms one , as interpretation of the law the other , the understanding of the facts to which it is to be applied . The great mass of our judicial officers are , I believe , alive to those changes of conditions which so materially affect the performance of their judicial duties . Our judicial system is sound and effective at core , and it remains , and must ever be maintained , as the safeguard of those principles of liberty and justice which stand at the foundation of American institutions for , as Burke finely said , when liberty and justice are separated , neither is safe . There are , however , some members of the judicial body who have lagged behind in their understanding of these great and vital changes in the body politic , whose minds have never been opened to the new applications of the old principles made necessary by the new conditions . Judges of this stamp do lasting harm by their decisions , because they convince poor men in need of protection that the courts of the land are profoundly ignorant of and out of sympathy with their needs , and profoundly indifferent or hostile to any proposed remedy . To such men it seems a cruel mockery to have any court decide against them on the ground that it desires to preserve liberty in a purely technical form , by withholding liberty in any real and constructive sense . It is desirable that the legislative body should possess , and wherever necessary exercise , the power to determine whether in a given case employers and employees are not on an equal footing , so that the necessities of the latter compel them to submit to such exactions as to hours and conditions of labor as unduly to tax their strength and only mischief can result when such determination is upset on the ground that there must be no interference with the liberty to contract often a merely academic liberty , the exercise of which is the negation of real liberty . There are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly detrimental to the rights of wageworkers . This is true of all the decisions that decide that men and women are , by the Constitution , guaranteed their liberty to contract to enter a dangerous occupation , or to work an undesirable or improper number of hours , or to work in unhealthy surroundings and therefore can not recover damages when maimed in that occupation and can not be forbidden to work what the legislature decides is an excessive number of hours , or to carry on the work under conditions which the legislature decides to be unhealthy . The most dangerous occupations are often the poorest paid and those where the hours of work are longest and in many cases those who go into them are driven by necessity so great that they have practically no alternative . Decisions such as those alluded to above nullify the legislative effort to protect the wage workers who most need protection from those employers who take advantage of their grinding need . They halt or hamper the movement for securing better and more equitable conditions of labor . The talk about preserving to the misery hunted beings who make contracts for such service their liberty to make them , is either to speak in a spirit of heartless irony or else to show an utter lack of knowledge of the conditions of life among the great masses of our fellow countrymen , a lack which unfits a judge to do good service just as it would unfit any executive or legislative officer . There is also , I think , ground for the belief that substantial injustice is often suffered by employees in consequence of the custom of courts issuing temporary injunctions without notice to them , and punishing them for contempt of court in instances where , as a matter of fact , they have no knowledge of any proceedings . Outside of organized labor there is a widespread feeling that this system often works great injustice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their working condition result in industrial disputes . A temporary injunction procured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a permanent injunction in causing disaster to the wageworkers side in such a dispute . Organized labor is chafing under the unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure . Its discontent has been unwisely expressed , and often improperly expressed , but there is a sound basis for it , and the orderly and law abiding people of a community would be in a far stronger position for upholding the courts if the undoubtedly existing abuses could be provided against . Such proposals as those mentioned above as advocated by the extreme labor leaders contain the vital error of being class legislation of the most offensive kind , and even if enacted into law I believe that the law would rightly be held unconstitutional . Moreover , the labor people are themselves now beginning to invoke the use of the power of injunction . During the last ten years , and within my own knowledge , at least fifty injunctions have been obtained by labor unions in New York City alone , most of them being to protect the union label a property right , but some being obtained for other reasons against employers . The power of injunction is a great equitable remedy , which should on no account be destroyed . But safeguards should be erected against its abuse . I believe that some such provisions as those I advocated a year ago for checking the abuse of the issuance of temporary injunctions should be adopted . In substance , provision should be made that no injunction or temporary restraining order issue otherwise than on notice , except where irreparable injury would otherwise result and in such case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a short fixed period , and , if not then continued after hearing , it should forthwith lapse . Decisions should be rendered immediately , and the chance of delay minimized in every way . Moreover , I believe that the procedure should be sharply defined , and the judge required minutely to state the particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor , so that the Congress can , if it desires , examine and investigate the same . The chief lawmakers in our country may be , and often are , the judges , because they are the final seat of authority . Every time they interpret contract , property , vested rights , due process of law , liberty , they necessarily enact into law parts of a system of social philosophy , and as such interpretation is fundamental , they give direction to all law making . The decisions of the courts on economic and social questions depend upon their economic and social philosophy and for the peaceful progress of our people during the twentieth century we shall owe most to those judges who hold to a twentieth century economic and social philosophy and not to a long outgrown philosophy , which was itself the product of primitive economic conditions . Of course a judge s views on progressive social philosophy are entirely second in importance to his possession of a high and fine character which means the possession of such elementary virtues as honesty , courage , and fair mindedness . The judge who owes his election to pandering to demagogic sentiments or class hatreds and prejudices , and the judge who owes either his election or his appointment to the money or the favor of a great corporation , are alike unworthy to sit on the bench , are alike traitors to the people and no profundity of legal learning , or correctness of abstract conviction on questions of public policy , can serve as an offset to such shortcomings . But it is also true that judges , like executives and legislators , should hold sound views on the questions of public policy which are of vital interest to the people . The legislators and executives are chosen to represent the people in enacting and administering the laws . The judges are not chosen to represent the people in this sense . Their function is to interpret the laws . The legislators are responsible for the laws the judges for the spirit in which they interpret and enforce the laws . We stand aloof from the reckless agitators who would make the judges mere pliant tools of popular prejudice and passion and we stand aloof from those equally unwise partisans of reaction and privilege who deny the proposition that , inasmuch as judges are chosen to serve the interests of the whole people , they should strive to find out what those interests are , and , so far as they conscientiously can , should strive to give effect to popular conviction when deliberately and duly expressed by the lawmaking body . The courts are to be highly commended and staunchly upheld when they set their faces against wrongdoing or tyranny by a majority but they are to be blamed when they fail to recognize under a government like ours the deliberate judgment of the majority as to a matter of legitimate policy , when duly expressed by the legislature . Such lawfully expressed and deliberate judgment should be given effect by the courts , save in the extreme and exceptional cases where there has been a clear violation of a constitutional provision . Anything like frivolity or wantonness in upsetting such clearly taken governmental action is a grave offense against the Republic . To protest against tyranny , to protect minorities from oppression , to nullify an act committed in a spasm of popular fury , is to render a service to the Republic . But for the courts to arrogate to themselves functions which properly belong to the legislative bodies is all wrong , and in the end works mischief . The people should not be permitted to pardon evil and slipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it right they should be taught that the right way to get rid of a bad law is to have the legislature repeal it , and not to have the courts by ingenious hair splitting nullify it . A law may be unwise and improper but it should not for these reasons be declared unconstitutional by a strained interpretation , for the result of such action is to take away from the people at large their sense of responsibility and ultimately to destroy their capacity for orderly self restraint and self government . Under such a popular government as ours , rounded on the theory that in the long run the will of the people is supreme , the ultimate safety of the Nation can only rest in training and guiding the people so that what they will shall be right , and not in devising means to defeat their will by the technicalities of strained construction . For many of the shortcomings of justice in our country our people as a whole are themselves to blame , and the judges and juries merely bear their share together with the public as a whole . It is discreditable to us as a people that there should be difficulty in convicting murderers , or in bringing to justice men who as public servants have been guilty of corruption , or who have profited by the corruption of public servants . The result is equally unfortunate , whether due to hairsplitting technicalities in the interpretation of law by judges , to sentimentality and class consciousness on the part of juries , or to hysteria and sensationalism in the daily press . For much of this failure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such . We who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibility from our own shoulders . But there is an important part of the failure which has specially to do with inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave badly . The chief breakdown is in dealing with the new relations that arise from the mutualism , the interdependence of our time . Every new social relation begets a new type of wrongdoing of sin , to use an old fashioned word and many years always elapse before society is able to turn this sin into crime which can be effectively punished at law . During the lifetime of the older men now alive the social relations have changed far more rapidly than in the preceding two centuries . The immense growth of corporations , of business done by associations , and the extreme strain and pressure of modern life , have produced conditions which render the public confused as to who its really dangerous foes are and among the public servants who have not only shared this confusion , but by some of their acts have increased it , are certain judges . Marked inefficiency has been shown in dealing with corporations and in re settling the proper attitude to be taken by the public not only towards corporations , but towards labor and towards the social questions arising out of the factory system and the enormous growth of our great cities . The huge wealth that has been accumulated by a few individuals of recent years , in what has amounted to a social and industrial revolution , has been as regards some of these individuals made possible only by the improper use of the modern corporation . A certain type of modern corporation , with its officers and agents , its many issues of securities , and its constant consolidation with allied undertakings , finally becomes an instrument so complex as to contain a greater number of elements that , under various judicial decisions , lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved in the human brain . Corporations are necessary instruments of modern business . They have been permitted to become a menace largely because the governmental representatives of the people have worked slowly in providing for adequate control over them . The chief offender in any given case may be an executive , a legislature , or a judge . Every executive head who advises violent , instead of gradual , action , or who advocates ill considered and sweeping measures of reform especially if they are tainted with vindictiveness and disregard for the rights of the minority is particularly blameworthy . The several legislatures are responsible for the fact that our laws are often prepared with slovenly haste and lack of consideration . Moreover , they are often prepared , and still more frequently amended during passage , at the suggestion of the very parties against whom they are afterwards enforced . Our great clusters of corporations , huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multi millionaires , employ the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws in these statutes after their passage but they also employ a class of secret agents who seek , under the advice of experts , to render hostile legislation innocuous by making it unconstitutional , often through the insertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provisions against the interests of the parties inspiring them while the demagogues , the corrupt creatures who introduce blackmailing schemes to strike corporations , and all who demand extreme , and undesirably radical , measures , show themselves to be the worst enemies of the very public whose loud mouthed champions they profess to be . A very striking illustration of the consequences of carelessness in the preparation of a statute was the employers liability law of 1906 . In the cases arising under that law , four out of six courts of first instance held it unconstitutional six out of nine justices of the Supreme Court held that its subject matter was within the province of congressional action and four of the nine justices held it valid . It was , however , adjudged unconstitutional by a bare majority of the court five to four . It was surely a very slovenly piece of work to frame the legislation in such shape as to leave the question open at all . Real damage has been done by the manifold and conflicting interpretations of the interstate commerce law . Control over the great corporations doing interstate business can be effective only if it is vested with full power in an administrative department , a branch of the Federal executive , carrying out a Federal law it can never be effective if a divided responsibility is left in both the States and the Nation it can never be effective if left in the hands of the courts to be decided by lawsuits . The courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our form of government . Respect for the law is essential to the permanence of our institutions and respect for the law is largely conditioned upon respect for the courts . It is an offense against the Republic to say anything which can weaken this respect , save for the gravest reason and in the most carefully guarded manner . Our judges should be held in peculiar honor and the duty of respectful and truthful comment and criticism , which should be binding when we speak of anybody , should be especially binding when we speak of them . On an average they stand above any other servants of the community , and the greatest judges have reached the high level held by those few greatest patriots whom the whole country delights to honor . But we must face the fact that there are wise and unwise judges , just as there are wise and unwise executives and legislators . When a president or a governor behaves improperly or unwisely , the remedy is easy , for his term is short the same is true with the legislator , although not to the same degree , for he is one of many who belong to some given legislative body , and it is therefore less easy to fix his personal responsibility and hold him accountable therefor . With a judge , who , being human , is also likely to err , but whose tenure is for life , there is no similar way of holding him to responsibility . Under ordinary conditions the only forms of pressure to which he is in any way amenable are public opinion and the action of his fellow judges . It is the last which is most immediately effective , and to which we should look for the reform of abuses . Any remedy applied from without is fraught with risk . It is far better , from every standpoint , that the remedy should come from within . In no other nation in the world do the courts wield such vast and far reaching power as in the United States . All that is necessary is that the courts as a whole should exercise this power with the farsighted wisdom already shown by those judges who scan the future while they act in the present . Let them exercise this great power not only honestly and bravely , but with wise insight into the needs and fixed purposes of the people , so that they may do justice and work equity , so that they may protect all persons in their rights , and yet break down the barriers of privilege , which is the foe of right . If there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to our children and our children s children to perform at once , it is to save the forests of this country , for they constitute the first and most important element in the conservation of the natural resources of the country . There are of course two kinds of natural resources , One is the kind which can only be used as part of a process of exhaustion this is true of mines , natural oil and gas wells , and the like . The other , and of course ultimately by far the most important , includes the resources which can be improved in the process of wise use the soil , the rivers , and the forests come under this head . Any really civilized nation will so use all of these three great national assets that the nation will have their benefit in the future . Just as a farmer , after all his life making his living from his farm , will , if he is an expert farmer , leave it as an asset of increased value to his son , so we should leave our national domain to our children , increased in value and not worn out . There are small sections of our own country , in the East and the West , in the Adriondacks , the White Mountains , and the Appalachians , and in the Rocky Mountains , where we can already see for ourselves the damage in the shape of permanent injury to the soil and the river systems which comes from reckless deforestation . It matters not whether this deforestation is due to the actual reckless cutting of timber , to the fires that inevitably follow such reckless cutting of timber , or to reckless and uncontrolled grazing , especially by the great migratory bands of sheep , the unchecked wandering of which over the country means destruction to forests and disaster to the small home makers , the settlers of limited means . Shortsighted persons , or persons blinded to the future by desire to make money in every way out of the present , sometimes speak as if no great damage would be done by the reckless destruction of our forests . It is difficult to have patience with the arguments of these persons . Thanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests , we have already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country , and no measures that we now take can , at least for many years , undo the mischief that has already been done . But we can prevent further mischief being done and it would be in the highest degree reprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or temporary cost interfere with such action , especially as regards the National Forests which the nation can now , at this very moment , control . All serious students of the question are aware of the great damage that has been done in the Mediterranean countries of Europe , Asia , and Africa by deforestation . The similar damage that has been done in Eastern Asia is less well known . A recent investigation into conditions in North China by Frank Meyer , of the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture , has incidentally furnished in very striking fashion proof of the ruin that comes from reckless deforestation of mountains , and of the further fact that the damage once done may prove practically irreparable . So important are these investigations that I herewith attach as an appendix to my message certain photographs showing present conditions in China . They show in vivid fashion the appalling desolation , taking the shape of barren mountains and gravel and sand covered plains , which immediately follows and depends upon the deforestation of the mountains . Not many centuries ago the country of northern China was one of the most fertile and beautiful spots in the entire world , and was heavily forested . We know this not only from the old Chinese records , but from the accounts given by the traveler , Marco Polo . He , for instance , mentions that in visiting the provinces of Shansi and Shensi he observed many plantations of mulberry trees . Now there is hardly a single mulberry tree in either of these provinces , and the culture of the silkworm has moved farther south , to regions of atmospheric moisture . As an illustration of the complete change in the rivers , we may take Polo s statement that a certain river , the Hun Ho , was so large and deep that merchants ascended it from the sea with heavily laden boats today this river is simply a broad sandy bed , with shallow , rapid currents wandering hither and thither across it , absolutely unnavigable . But we do not have to depend upon written records . The dry wells , and the wells with water far below the former watermark , bear testimony to the good days of the past and the evil days of the present . Wherever the native vegetation has been allowed to remain , as , for instance , here and there around a sacred temple or imperial burying ground , there are still huge trees and tangled jungle , fragments of the glorious ancient forests . The thick , matted forest growth formerly covered the mountains to their summits . All natural factors favored this dense forest growth , and as long as it was permitted to exist the plains at the foot of the mountains were among the most fertile on the globe , and the whole country was a garden . Not the slightest effort was made , however , to prevent the unchecked cutting of the trees , or to secure reforestation . Doubtless for many centuries the tree cutting by the inhabitants of the mountains worked but slowly in bringing about the changes that have now come to pass doubtless for generations the inroads were scarcely noticeable . But there came a time when the forest had shrunk sufficiently to make each year s cutting a serious matter , and from that time on the destruction proceeded with appalling rapidity for of course each year of destruction rendered the forest less able to recuperate , less able to resist next year s inroad . Meyer describes the ceaseless progress of the destruction even now , when there is so little left to destroy . Every morning men and boys go out armed with mattox or axe , scale the steepest mountain sides , and cut down and grub out , root and branch , the small trees and shrubs still to be found . The big trees disappeared centuries ago , so that now one of these is never seen save in the neighborhood of temples , where they are artificially protected and even here it takes all the watch and care of the tree loving priests to prevent their destruction . Each family , each community , where there is no common care exercised in the interest of all of them to prevent deforestation , finds its profit in the immediate use of the fuel which would otherwise be used by some other family or some other community . In the total absence of regulation of the matter in the interest of the whole people , each small group is inevitably pushed into a policy of destruction which can not afford to take thought for the morrow . This is just one of those matters which it is fatal to leave to unsupervised individual control . The forest can only be protected by the State , by the Nation and the liberty of action of individuals must be conditioned upon what the State or Nation determines to be necessary for the common safety . The lesson of deforestation in China is a lesson which mankind should have learned many times already from what has occurred in other places . Denudation leaves naked soil then gullying cuts down to the bare rock and meanwhile the rock waste buries the bottomlands . When the soil is gone , men must go and the process does not take long . This ruthless destruction of the forests in northern China has brought about , or has aided in bringing about , desolation , just as the destruction of the forests in central Asia aid in bringing ruin to the once rich central Asian cities just as the destruction of the forest in northern Africa helped towards the ruin of a region that was a fertile granary in Roman days . Shortsighted man , whether barbaric , semi civilized , or what he mistakenly regards as fully civilized , when he has destroyed the forests , has rendered certain the ultimate destruction of the land itself . In northern China the mountains are now such as are shown by the accompanying photographs , absolutely barren peaks . Not only have the forests been destroyed , but because of their destruction the soil has been washed off the naked rock . The terrible consequence is that it is impossible now to undo the damage that has been done . Many centuries would have to pass before soil would again collect , or could be made to collect , in sufficient quantity once more to support the old time forest growth . In consequence the Mongol Desert is practically extending eastward over northern China . The climate has changed and is still changing . It has changed even within the last half century , as the work of tree destruction has been consummated . The great masses of arboreal vegetation on the mountains formerly absorbed the heat of the sun and sent up currents of cool air which brought the moisture laden clouds lower and forced them to precipitate in rain a part of their burden of water . Now that there is no vegetation , the barren mountains , scorched by the sun , send up currents of heated air which drive away instead of attracting the rain clouds , and cause their moisture to be disseminated . In consequence , instead of the regular and plentiful rains which existed in these regions of China when the forests were still in evidence , the unfortunate inhabitants of the deforested lands now see their crops wither for lack of rainfall , while the seasons grow more and more irregular and as the air becomes dryer certain crops refuse longer to grow at all . That everything dries out faster than formerly is shown by the fact that the level of the wells all over the land has sunk perceptibly , many of them having become totally dry . In addition to the resulting agricultural distress , the watercourses have changed . Formerly they were narrow and deep , with an abundance of clear water the year around for the roots and humus of the forests caught the rainwater and let it escape by slow , regular seepage . They have now become broad , shallow stream beds , in which muddy water trickles in slender currents during the dry seasons , while when it rains there are freshets , and roaring muddy torrents come tearing down , bringing disaster and destruction everywhere . Moreover , these floods and freshets , which diversify the general dryness , wash away from the mountain sides , and either wash away or cover in the valleys , the rich fertile soil which it took tens of thousands of years for Nature to form and it is lost forever , and until the forests grow again it can not be replaced . The sand and stones from the mountain sides are washed loose and come rolling down to cover the arable lands , and in consequence , throughout this part of China , many formerly rich districts are now sandy wastes , useless for human cultivation and even for pasture . The cities have been of course seriously affected , for the streams have gradually ceased to be navigable . There is testimony that even within the memory of men now living there has been a serious diminution of the rainfall of northeastern China . The level of the Sungari River in northern Manchuria has been sensibly lowered during the last fifty years , at least partly as the result of the indiscriminate rutting of the forests forming its watershed . Almost all the rivers of northern China have become uncontrollable , and very dangerous to the dwellers along their banks , as a direct result of the destruction of the forests . The journey from Pekin to Jehol shows in melancholy fashion how the soil has been washed away from whole valleys , so that they have been converted into deserts . In northern China this disastrous process has gone on so long and has proceeded so far that no complete remedy could be applied . There are certain mountains in China from which the soil is gone so utterly that only the slow action of the ages could again restore it although of course much could be done to prevent the still further eastward extension of the Mongolian Desert if the Chinese Government would act at once . The accompanying cuts from photographs show the inconceivable desolation of the barren mountains in which certain of these rivers rise mountains , be it remembered , which formerly supported dense forests of larches and firs , now unable to produce any wood , and because of their condition a source of danger to the whole country . The photographs also show the same rivers after they have passed through the mountains , the beds having become broad and sandy because of the deforestation of the mountains . One of the photographs shows a caravan passing through a valley . Formerly , when the mountains were forested , it was thickly peopled by prosperous peasants . Now the floods have carried destruction all over the land and the valley is a stony desert . Another photograph shows a mountain road covered with the stones and rocks that are brought down in the rainy season from the mountains which have already been deforested by human hands . Another shows a pebbly river bed in southern Manchuria where what was once a great stream has dried up owing to the deforestation in the mountains . Only some scrub wood is left , which will disappear within a half century . Yet another shows the effect of one of the washouts , destroying an arable mountain side , these washouts being due to the removal of all vegetation yet in this photograph the foreground shows that reforestation is still a possibility in places . What has thus happened in northern China , what has happened in Central Asia , in Palestine , in North Africa , in parts of the Mediterranean countries of Europe , will surely happen in our country if we do not exercise that wise forethought which should be one of the chief marks of any people calling itself civilized . Nothing should be permitted to stand in the way of the preservation of the forests , and it is criminal to permit individuals to purchase a little gain for themselves through the destruction of forests when this destruction is fatal to the well being of the whole country in the future . Action should be begun forthwith , during the present session of the Congress , for the improvement of our inland waterways action which will result in giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers . We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars upon these waterways , yet the traffic on nearly all of them is steadily declining . This condition is the direct result of the absence of any comprehensive and far seeing plan of waterway improvement , Obviously we can not continue thus to expend the revenues of the Government without return . It is poor business to spend money for inland navigation unless we get it . Inquiry into the condition of the Mississippi and its principal tributaries reveals very many instances of the utter waste caused by the methods which have hitherto obtained for the so called improvement of navigation . A striking instance is supplied by the improvement of the Ohio , which , begun in 1824 , was continued under a single plan for half a century . In 1875 a new plan was adopted and followed for a quarter of a century . In 1902 still a different plan was adopted and has since been pursued at a rate which only promises a navigable river in from twenty to one hundred years longer . Such shortsighted , vacillating , and futile methods are accompanied by decreasing water borne commerce and increasing traffic congestion on land , by increasing floods , and by the waste of public money . The remedy lies in abandoning the methods which have so signally failed and adopting new ones in keeping with the needs and demands of our people . In a report on a measure introduced at the first session of the present Congress , the Secretary of War said The chief defect in the methods hitherto pursued lies in the absence of executive authority for originating comprehensive plans covering the country or natural divisions thereof . In this opinion I heartily concur . The present methods not only fail to give us inland navigation , but they are injurious to the army as well . What is virtually a permanent detail of the corps of engineers to civilian duty necessarily impairs the efficiency of our military establishment . The military engineers have undoubtedly done efficient work in actual construction , but they are necessarily unsuited by their training and traditions to take the broad view , and to gather and transmit to the Congress the commercial and industrial information and forecasts , upon which waterway improvement must always so largely rest . Furthermore , they have failed to grasp the great underlying fact that every stream is a unit from its source to its mouth , and that all its uses are interdependent . Prominent officers of the Engineer Corps have recently even gone so far as to assert in print that waterways are not dependent upon the conservation of the forests about their headwaters . This position is opposed to all the recent work of the scientific bureaus of the Government and to the general experience of mankind . A physician who disbelieved in vaccination would not be the right man to handle an epidemic of smallpox , nor should we leave a doctor skeptical about the transmission of yellow fever by the Stegomyia mosquito in charge of sanitation at Havana or Panama . So with the improvement of our rivers it is no longer wise or safe to leave this great work in the hands of men who fail to grasp the essential relations between navigation and general development and to assimilate and use the central facts about our streams . Until the work of river improvement is undertaken in a modern way it can not have results that will meet the needs of this modern nation . These needs should be met without further dilly dallying or delay . The plan which promises the best and quickest results is that of a permanent commission authorized to coordinate the work of all the Government departments relating to waterways , and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan . Under such a commission the actual work of construction might be entrusted to the reclamation service or to the military engineers acting with a sufficient number of civilians to continue the work in time of war or it might be divided between the reclamation service and the corps of engineers . Funds should be provided from current revenues if it is deemed wise otherwise from the sale of bonds . The essential thing is that the work should go forward under the best possible plan , and with the least possible delay . We should have a new type of work and a new organization for planning and directing it . The time for playing with our waterways is past . The country demands results . I urge that all our National parks adjacent to National forests be placed completely under the control of the forest service of the Agricultural Department , instead of leaving them as they now are , under the Interior Department and policed by the army . The Congress should provide for superintendents with adequate corps of first class civilian scouts , or rangers , and , further , place the road construction under the superintendent instead of leaving it with the War Department . Such a change in park management would result in economy and avoid the difficulties of administration which now arise from having the responsibility of care and protection divided between different departments . The need for this course is peculiarly great in the Yellowstone Park . This , like the Yosemite , is a great wonderland , and should be kept as a national playground . In both , all wild things should be protected and the scenery kept wholly unmarred . I am happy to say that I have been able to set aside in various parts of the country small , well chosen tracts of ground to serve as sanctuaries and nurseries for wild creatures . I had occasion in my message of May 4 , 1906 , to urge the passage of some law putting alcohol , used in the arts , industries , and manufactures , upon the free list that is , to provide for the withdrawal free of tax of alcohol which is to be denatured for those purposes . The law of June 7 , 1906 , and its amendment of March 2 , 1907 , accomplished what was desired in that respect , and the use of denatured alcohol , as intended , is making a fair degree of progress and is entitled to further encouragement and support from the Congress . The pure food legislation has already worked a benefit difficult to overestimate . It has been my purpose from the beginning of my administration to take the Indian Service completely out of the atmosphere of political activity , and there has been steady progress toward that end . The last remaining stronghold of politics in that service was the agency system , which had seen its best days and was gradually falling to pieces from natural or purely evolutionary causes , but , like all such survivals , was decaying slowly in its later stages . It seems clear that its extinction had better be made final now , so that the ground can be cleared for larger constructive work on behalf of the Indians , preparatory to their induction into the full measure of responsible citizenship . On November 1 only eighteen agencies were left on the roster with two exceptions , where some legal questions seemed to stand temporarily in the way , these have been changed to superintendencies , and their heads brought into the classified civil service . Last year an amendment was incorporated in the measure providing for the Secret Service , which provided that there should be no detail from the Secret Service and no transfer therefrom . It is not too much to say that this amendment has been of benefit only , and could be of benefit only , to the criminal classes . If deliberately introduced for the purpose of diminishing the effectiveness of war against crime it could not have been better devised to this end . It forbade the practices that had been followed to a greater or less extent by the executive heads of various departments for twenty years . To these practices we owe the securing of the evidence which enabled us to drive great lotteries out of business and secure a quarter of a million of dollars in fines from their promoters . These practices have enabled us to get some of the evidence indispensable in order in connection with the theft of government land and government timber by great corporations and by individuals . These practices have enabled us to get some of the evidence indispensable in order to secure the conviction of the wealthiest and most formidable criminals with whom the Government has to deal , both those operating in violation of the anti trust law and others . The amendment in question was of benefit to no one excepting to these criminals , and it seriously hampers the Government in the detection of crime and the securing of justice . Moreover , it not only affects departments outside of the Treasury , but it tends to hamper the Secretary of the Treasury himself in the effort to utilize the employees of his department so as to best meet the requirements of the public service . It forbids him from preventing frauds upon the customs service , from investigating irregularities in branch mints and assay offices , and has seriously crippled him . It prevents the promotion of employees in the Secret Service , and this further discourages good effort . In its present form the restriction operates only to the advantage of the criminal , of the wrongdoer . The chief argument in favor of the provision was that the Congressmen did not themselves wish to be investigated by Secret Service men . Very little of such investigation has been done in the past but it is true that the work of the Secret Service agents was partly responsible for the indictment and conviction of a Senator and a Congressman for land frauds in Oregon . I do not believe that it is in the public interest to protect criminally in any branch of the public service , and exactly as we have again and again during the past seven years prosecuted and convicted such criminals who were in the executive branch of the Government , so in my belief we should be given ample means to prosecute them if found in the legislative branch . But if this is not considered desirable a special exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of the Secret Service force in investigating members of the Congress . It would be far better to do this than to do what actually was done , and strive to prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminals by the executive branch of the Government . I again renew my recommendation for postal savings hanks , for depositing savings with the security of the Government behind them . The object is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage earner and person of moderate means . In 14 States the deposits in savings banks as reported to the Comptroller of the Currency amount to 3 , 590 , 245 , 402 , or 98 . 4 per cent of the entire deposits , while in the remaining 32 States there are only 70 , 308 , 543 , or 1 . 6 per cent , showing conclusively that there are many localities in the United States where sufficient opportunity is not given to the people to deposit their savings . The result is that money is kept in hiding and unemployed . It is believed that in the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought into circulation through the instrumentality of the postal savings banks . While there are only 1 , 453 savings banks reporting to the Comptroller there are more than 61 , 000 post offices , 40 , 000 of which are money order offices . Postal savings banks are now in operation in practically all of the great civilized countries with the exception of the United States . In my last annual message I commended the Postmaster General s recommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes . The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and the country storekeeper , and it is desirable that the routes , serving more than 15 , 000 , 000 people , should be utilized to the fullest practicable extent . An amendment was proposed in the Senate at the last session , at the suggestion of the Postmaster General , providing that , for the purpose of ascertaining the practicability of establishing a special local parcel post system on the rural routes throughout the United States , the Postmaster General be authorized and directed to experiment and report to the Congress the result of such experiment by establishing a special local parcel post system on rural delivery routes in not to exceed four counties in the United States for packages of fourth class matter originating on a rural route or at the distributing post office for delivery by rural carriers . It would seem only proper that such an experiment should be tried in order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposition , especially as the Postmaster General estimates that the revenue derived from the operation of such a system on all the rural routes would amount to many million dollars . The share that the National Government should take in the broad work of education has not received the attention and the care it rightly deserves . The immediate responsibility for the support and improvement of our educational systems and institutions rests and should always rest with the people of the several States acting through their state and local governments , but the Nation has an opportunity in educational work which must not be lost and a duty which should no longer be neglected . The National Bureau of Education was established more than forty years ago . Its purpose is to collect and diffuse such information as shall aid the people of the United States in the establishment and maintenance of efficient school systems and otherwise promote the cause of education throughout the country . This purpose in no way conflicts with the educational work of the States , but may be made of great advantage to the States by giving them the fullest , most accurate , and hence the most helpful information and suggestion regarding the best educational systems . The Nation , through its broader field of activities , its wider opportunity for obtaining information from all the States and from foreign countries , is able to do that which not even the richest States can do , and with the distinct additional advantage that the information thus obtained is used for the immediate benefit of all our people . With the limited means hitherto provided , the Bureau of Education has rendered efficient service , but the Congress has neglected to adequately supply the bureau with means to meet the educational growth of the country . The appropriations for the general work of the bureau , outside education in Alaska , for the year 1909 are but 87 , 500 an amount less than they were ten years ago , and some of the important items in these appropriations are less than they were thirty years ago . It is an inexcusable waste of public money to appropriate an amount which is so inadequate as to make it impossible properly to do the work authorized , and it is unfair to the great educational interests of the country to deprive them of the value of the results which can be obtained by proper appropriations . I earnestly recommend that this unfortunate state of affairs as regards the national educational office be remedied by adequate appropriations . This recommendation is urged by the representatives of our common schools and great state universities and the leading educators , who all unite in requesting favorable consideration and action by the Congress upon this subject . I strongly urge that the request of the Director of the Census in connection with the decennial work so soon to be begun be complied with and that the appointments to the census force be placed under the civil service law , waiving the geographical requirements as requested by the Director of the Census . The supervisors and enumerators should not be appointed under the civil service law , for the reasons given by the Director . I commend to the Congress the careful consideration of the admirable report of the Director of the Census , and I trust that his recommendations will be adopted and immediate action thereon taken . It is highly advisable that there should be intelligent action on the part of the Nation on the question of preserving the health of the country . Through the practical extermination in San Francisco of disease bearing rodents our country has thus far escaped the bubonic plague . This is but one of the many achievements of American health officers and it shows what can be accomplished with a better organization than at present exists . The dangers to public health from food adulteration and from many other sources , such as the menace to the physical , mental and moral development of children from child labor , should be met and overcome . There are numerous diseases , which are now known to be preventable , which are , nevertheless , not prevented . The recent International Congress on Tuberculosis has made us painfully aware of the inadequacy of American public health legislation . This Nation can not afford to lag behind in the world wide battle now being waged by all civilized people with the microscopic foes of mankind , nor ought we longer to ignore the reproach that this Government takes more pains to protect the lives of hogs and of cattle than of human beings . The first legislative step to be taken is that for the concentration of the proper bureaus into one of the existing departments . I therefore urgently recommend the passage of a bill which shall authorize a redistribution of the bureaus which shall best accomplish this end . I recommend that legislation be enacted placing under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce and Labor the Government Printing Office . At present this office is under the combined control , supervision , and administrative direction of the President and of the Joint Committee on Printing of the two Houses of the Congress . The advantage of having the 4 , 069 employees in this office and the expenditure of the 5 , 761 , 377 . 57 appropriated therefor supervised by an executive department is obvious , instead of the present combined supervision . All Soldiers Homes should be placed under the complete jurisdiction and control of the War Department . Economy and sound business policy require that all existing independent bureaus and commissions should be placed under the jurisdiction of appropriate executive departments . It is unwise from every standpoint , and results only in mischief , to have any executive work done save by the purely executive bodies , under the control of the President and each such executive body should be under the immediate supervision of a Cabinet Minister . I advocate the immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as States . This should be done at the present session of the Congress . The people of the two Territories have made it evident by their votes that they will not come in as one State . The only alternative is to admit them as two , and I trust that this will be done without delay . I call the attention of the Congress to the importance of the problem of the fisheries in the interstate waters . On the Great Lakes we are now , under the very wise treaty of April 11th of this year , endeavoring to come to an international agreement for the preservation and satisfactory use of the fisheries of these waters which can not otherwise be achieved . Lake Erie , for example , has the richest fresh water fisheries in the world but it is now controlled by the statutes of two Nations , four States , and one Province , and in this Province by different ordinances in different counties . All these political divisions work at cross purposes , and in no case can they achieve protection to the fisheries , on the one hand , and justice to the localities and individuals on the other . The case is similar in Puget Sound . But the problem is quite as pressing in the interstate waters of the United States . The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but a fraction of what they were twenty five years ago , and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington . During these twenty five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get , and the two legislatures have never been able to agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries . At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed , while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind , and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non action result . Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds , and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing and this comes from a struggle between the associated , or gill net , fishermen on the one hand , and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river . The fisheries of the Mississippi , the Ohio , and the Potomac are also in a bad way . For this there is no remedy except for the United States to control and legislate for the interstate fisheries as part of the business of interstate commerce . In this case the machinery for scientific investigation and for control already exists in the United States Bureau of Fisheries . In this as in similar problems the obvious and simple rule should be followed of having those matters which no particular State can manage taken in hand by the United States problems which in the seesaw of conflicting State legislatures are absolutely unsolvable are easy enough for Congress to control . The federal statute regulating interstate traffic in game should be extended to include fish . New federal fish hatcheries should be established . The administration of the Alaskan fur seal service should be vested in the Bureau of Fisheries . This Nation s foreign policy is based on the theory that right must be done between nations precisely as between individuals , and in our actions for the last ten years we have in this matter proven our faith by our deeds . We have behaved , and are behaving , towards other nations as in private life an honorable man would behave towards his fellows . The commercial and material progress of the twenty Latin American Republics is worthy of the careful attention of the Congress . No other section of the world has shown a greater proportionate development of its foreign trade during the last ten years and none other has more special claims on the interest of the United States . It offers to day probably larger opportunities for the legitimate expansion of our commerce than any other group of countries . These countries will want our products in greatly increased quantities , and we shall correspondingly need theirs . The International Bureau of the American Republics is doing a useful work in making these nations and their resources better known to us , and in acquainting them not only with us as a people and with our purposes towards them , but with what we have to exchange for their goods . It is an international institution supported by all the governments of the two Americas . The work on the Panama Canal is being done with a speed , efficiency and entire devotion to duty which make it a model for all work of the kind . No task of such magnitude has ever before been undertaken by any nation and no task of the kind has ever been better performed . The men on the isthmus , from Colonel Goethals and his fellow commissioners through the entire list of employees who are faithfully doing their duty , have won their right to the ungrudging respect and gratitude of the American people . I again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 so that satisfactory American ocean mail lines to South America , Asia , the Philippines , and Australiasia may be established . The creation of such steamship lines should be the natural corollary of the voyage of the battle fleet . It should precede the opening of the Panamal Canal . Even under favorable conditions several years must elapse before such lines can be put into operation . Accordingly I urge that the Congress act promptly where foresight already shows that action sooner or later will be inevitable . I call particular attention to the Territory of Hawaii . The importance of those islands is apparent , and the need of improving their condition and developing their resources is urgent . In recent years industrial conditions upon the islands have radically changed , The importation of coolie labor has practically ceased , and there is now developing such a diversity in agricultural products as to make possible a change in the land conditions of the Territory , so that an opportunity may be given to the small land owner similar to that on the mainland . To aid these changes , the National Government must provide the necessary harbor improvements on each island , so that the agricultural products can be carried to the markets of the world . The coastwise shipping laws should be amended to meet the special needs of the islands , and the alien contract labor law should be so modified in its application to Hawaii as to enable American and European labor to be brought thither . We have begun to improve Pearl Harbor for a naval base and to provide the necessary military fortifications for the protection of the islands , but I can not too strongly emphasize the need of appropriations for these purposes of such an amount as will within the shortest possible time make those islands practically impregnable . It is useless to develop the industrial conditions of the islands and establish there bases of supply for our naval and merchant fleets unless we insure , as far as human ingenuity can , their safety from foreign seizure . One thing to be remembered with all our fortifications is that it is almost useless to make them impregnable from the sea if they are left open to land attack . This is true even of our own coast , but it is doubly true of our insular possessions . In Hawaii , for instance , it is worse than useless to establish a naval station unless we establish it behind fortifications so strong that no landing force can take them save by regular and long continued siege operations . Real progress toward self government is being made in the Philippine Islands . The gathering of a Philippine legislative body and Philippine assembly marks a process absolutely new in Asia , not only as regards Asiatic colonies of European powers but as regards Asiatic possessions of other Asiatic powers and , indeed , always excepting the striking and wonderful example afforded by the great Empire of Japan , it opens an entirely new departure when compared with anything which has happened among Asiatic powers which are their own masters . Hitherto this Philippine legislature has acted with moderation and self restraint , and has seemed in practical fashion to realize the eternal truth that there must always be government , and that the only way in which any body of individuals can escape the necessity of being governed by outsiders is to show that they are able to restrain themselves , to keep down wrongdoing and disorder . The Filipino people , through their officials , are therefore making real steps in the direction of self government . I hope and believe that these steps mark the beginning of a course which will continue till the Filipinos become fit to decide for themselves whether they desire to be an independent nation . But it is well for them and well also for those Americans who during the past decade have done so much damage to the Filipinos by agitation for an immediate independence for which they were totally unfit to remember that self government depends , and must depend , upon the Filipinos themselves . All we can do is to give them the opportunity to develop the capacity for self government . If we had followed the advice of the foolish doctrinaires who wished us at any time during the last ten years to turn the Filipino people adrift , we should have shirked the plainest possible duty and have inflicted a lasting wrong upon the Filipino people . We have acted in exactly the opposite spirit . We have given the Filipinos constitutional government a government based upon justice and we have shown that we have governed them for their good and not for our aggrandizement . At the present time , as during the past ten years , the inexorable logic of facts shows that this government must be supplied by us and not by them . We must be wise and generous we must help the Filipinos to master the difficult art of self control , which is simply another name for self government . But we can not give them self government save in the sense of governing them so that gradually they may , if they are able , learn to govern themselves . Under the present system of just laws and sympathetic administration , we have every reason to believe that they are gradually acquiring the character which lies at the basis of self government , and for which , if it be lacking , no system of laws , no paper constitution , will in any wise serve as a substitute . Our people in the Philippines have achieved what may legitimately be called a marvelous success in giving to them a government which marks on the part of those in authority both the necessary understanding of the people and the necessary purpose to serve them disinterestedly and in good faith . I trust that within a generation the time will arrive when the Philippines can decide for themselves whether it is well for them to become independent , or to continue under the protection of a strong and disinterested power , able to guarantee to the islands order at home and protection from foreign invasion . But no one can prophesy the exact date when it will be wise to consider independence as a fixed and definite policy . It would be worse than folly to try to set down such a date in advance , for it must depend upon the way in which the Philippine people themselves develop the power of self mastery . I again recommend that American citizenship be conferred upon the people of Porto Rico . In Cuba our occupancy will cease in about two months time , the Cubans have in orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities , and the island will be turned over to them . Our occupation on this occasion has lasted a little over two years , and Cuba has thriven and prospered under it . Our earnest hope and one desire is that the people of the island shall now govern themselves with justice , so that peace and order may be secure . We will gladly help them to this end but I would solemnly warn them to remember the great truth that the only way a people can permanently avoid being governed from without is to show that they both can and will govern themselves from within . The Japanese Government has postponed until 1917 the date of the great international exposition , the action being taken so as to insure ample time in which to prepare to make the exposition all that it should be made . The American commissioners have visited Japan and the postponement will merely give ampler opportunity for America to be represented at the exposition . Not since the first international exposition has there been one of greater importance than this will be , marking as it does the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to the throne of the Emperor of Japan . The extraordinary leap to a foremost place among the nations of the world made by Japan during this half century is something unparalleled in all previous history . This exposition will fitly commemorate and signalize the giant progress that has been achieved . It is the first exposition of its kind that has ever been held in Asia . The United States , because of the ancient friendship between the two peoples , because each of us fronts on the Pacific , and because of the growing commercial relations between this country and Asia , takes a peculiar interest in seeing the exposition made a success in every way . I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way in which in Japan , in Australia , in New Zealand , and in all the States of South America , the battle fleet has been received on its practice voyage around the world . The American Government can not too strongly express its appreciation of the abounding and generous hospitality shown our ships in every port they visited . As regards the Army I call attention to the fact that while our junior officers and enlisted men stand very high , the present system of promotion by seniority results in bringing into the higher grades many men of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve . No man should regard it as his vested right to rise to the highest rank in the Army any more than in any other profession . It is a curious and by no means creditable fact that there should be so often a failure on the part of the public and its representatives to understand the great need , from the standpoint of the service and the Nation , of refusing to promote respectable , elderly incompetents . The higher places should be given to the most deserving men without regard to seniority at least seniority should be treated as only one consideration . In the stress of modern industrial competition no business firm could succeed if those responsible for its management were chosen simply on the ground that they were the oldest people in its employment yet this is the course advocated as regards the Army , and required by law for all grades except those of general officer . As a matter of fact , all of the best officers in the highest ranks of the Army are those who have attained their present position wholly or in part by a process of selection . The scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they could consider general unfitness to command for any cause , in order to secure a far more rigid enforcement than at present in the elimination of officers for mental , physical or temperamental disabilities . But this plan is recommended only if the Congress does not see fit to provide what in my judgment is far better that is , for selection in promotion , and for elimination for age . Officers who fail to attain a certain rank by a certain age should be retired for instance , if a man should not attain field rank by the time he is 45 he should of course be placed on the retired list . General officers should be selected as at present , and one third of the other promotions should be made by selection , the selection to be made by the President or the Secretary of War from a list of at least two candidates proposed for each vacancy by a board of officers from the arm of the service from which the promotion is to be made . A bill is now before the Congress having for its object to secure the promotion of officers to various grades at reasonable ages through a process of selection , by boards of officers , of the least efficient for retirement with a percentage of their pay depending upon length of service . The bill , although not accomplishing all that should be done , is a long step in the right direction and I earnestly recommend its passage , or that of a more completely effective measure . The cavalry arm should be reorganized upon modern lines . This is an arm in which it is peculiarly necessary that the field officers should not be old . The cavalry is much more difficult to form than infantry , and it should be kept up to the maximum both in efficiency and in strength , for it can not be made in a hurry . At present both infantry and artillery are too few in number for our needs . Especial attention should be paid to development of the machine gun . A general service corps should be established . As things are now the average soldier has far too much labor of a nonmilitary character to perform . Now that the organized militia , the National Guard , has been incorporated with the Army as a part of the national forces , it behooves the Government to do every reasonable thing in its power to perfect its efficiency . It should be assisted in its instruction and otherwise aided more liberally than heretofore . The continuous services of many well trained regular officers will be essential in this connection . Such officers must be specially trained at service schools best to qualify them as instructors of the National Guard . But the detailing of officers for training at the service schools and for duty with the National Guard entails detaching them from their regiments which are already greatly depleted by detachment of officers for assignment to duties prescribed by acts of the Congress . A bill is now pending before the Congress creating a number of extra officers in the Army , which if passed , as it ought to be , will enable more officers to be trained as instructors of the National Guard and assigned to that duty . In case of war it will be of the utmost importance to have a large number of trained officers to use for turning raw levies into good troops . There should be legislation to provide a complete plan for organizing the great body of volunteers behind the Regular Army and National Guard when war has come . Congressional assistance should be given those who are endeavoring to promote rifle practice so that our men , in the services or out of them , may know how to use the rifle . While teams representing the United States won the rifle and revolver championships of the world against all comers in England this year , it is unfortunately true that the great body of our citizens shoot less and less as time goes on . To meet this we should encourage rifle practice among schoolboys , and indeed among all classes , as well as in the military services , by every means in our power . Thus , and not otherwise , may we be able to assist in preserving the peace of the world . Fit to hold our own against the strong nations of the earth , our voice for peace will carry to the ends of the earth . Unprepared , and therefore unfit , we must sit dumb and helpless to defend ourselves , protect others , or preserve peace . The first step in the direction of preparation to avert war if possible , and to be fit for war if it should come is to teach our men to shoot . I approve the recommendations of the General Board for the increase of the Navy , calling especial attention to the need of additional destroyers and colliers , and above all , of the four battleships . It is desirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battleships of the best existing type . The North Dakota , Delaware , Florida , and Utah will form the first division of this squadron . The four vessels proposed will form the second division . It will be an improvement on the first , the ships being of the heavy , single caliber , all big gun type . All the vessels should have the same tactical qualities that is , speed and turning circle and as near as possible these tactical qualities should be the same as in the four vessels before named now being built . I most earnestly recommend that the General Board be by law turned into a General Staff . There is literally no excuse whatever for continuing the present bureau organization of the Navy . The Navy should be treated as a purely military organization , and everything should be subordinated to the one object of securing military efficiency . Such military efficiency can only be guaranteed in time of war if there is the most thorough previous preparation in time of peace a preparation , I may add , which will in all probability prevent any need of war . The Secretary must be supreme , and he should have as his official advisers a body of line officers who should themselves have the power to pass upon and coordinate all the work and all the proposals of the several bureaus . A system of promotion by merit , either by selection or by exclusion , or by both processes , should be introduced . It is out of the question , if the present principle of promotion by mere seniority is kept , to expect to get the best results from the higher officers . Our men come too old , and stay for too short a time , in the high command positions . Two hospital ships should be provided . The actual experience of the hospital ship with the fleet in the Pacific has shown the invaluable work which such a ship does , and has also proved that it is well to have it kept under the command of a medical officer . As was to be expected , all of the anticipations of trouble from such a command have proved completely baseless . It is as absurd to put a hospital ship under a line officer as it would be to put a hospital on shore under such a command . This ought to have been realized before , and there is no excuse for failure to realize it now . Nothing better for the Navy from every standpoint has ever occurred than the cruise of the battle fleet around the world . The improvement of the ships in every way has been extraordinary , and they have gained far more experience in battle tactics than they would have gained if they had stayed in the Atlantic waters . The American people have cause for profound gratification , both in view of the excellent condition of the fleet as shown by this cruise , and in view of the improvement the cruise has worked in this already high condition . I do not believe that there is any other service in the world in which the average of character and efficiency in the enlisted men is as high as is now the case in our own . I believe that the same statement can be made as to our officers , taken as a whole but there must be a reservation made in regard to those in the highest ranks as to which I have already spoken and in regard to those who have just entered the service because we do not now get full benefit from our excellent naval school at Annapolis . It is absurd not to graduate the midshipmen as ensigns to keep them for two years in such an anomalous position as at present the law requires is detrimental to them and to the service . In the academy itself , every first classman should be required in turn to serve as petty officer and officer his ability to discharge his duties as such should be a prerequisite to his going into the line , and his success in commanding should largely determine his standing at graduation . The Board of Visitors should be appointed in January , and each member should be required to give at least six days service , only from one to three days to be performed during June week , which is the least desirable time for the board to be at Annapolis so far as benefiting the Navy by their observations is concerned .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives The country is to be congratulated on the amount of substantial achievement which has marked the past year both as regards our foreign and as regards our domestic policy . With a nation as with a man the most important things are those of the household , and therefore the country is especially to be congratulated on what has been accomplished in the direction of providing for the exercise of supervision over the great corporations and combinations of corporations engaged in interstate commerce . The Congress has created the Department of Commerce and Labor , including the Bureau of Corporations , with for the first time authority to secure proper publicity of such proceedings of these great corporations as the public has the right to know . It has provided for the expediting of suits for the enforcement of the Federal anti trust law and by another law it has secured equal treatment to all producers in the transportation of their goods , thus taking a long stride forward in making effective the work of the Interstate Commerce Commission . The establishment of the Department of Commerce and Labor , with the Bureau of Corporations thereunder , marks a real advance in the direction of doing all that is possible for the solution of the questions vitally affecting capitalists and wage workers . The act creating Department was approved on February 14 , 1903 , and two days later the head of the Department was nominated and confirmed by the Senate . Since then the work of organization has been pushed as rapidly as the initial appropriations permitted , and with due regard to thoroughness and the broad purposes which the Department is designed to serve . After the transfer of the various bureaus and branches to the Department at the beginning of the current fiscal year , as provided for in the act , the personnel comprised 1 , 289 employees in Washington and 8 , 836 in the country at large . The scope of the Department s duty and authority embraces the commercial and industrial interests of the Nation . It is not designed to restrict or control the fullest liberty of legitimate business action , but to secure exact and authentic information which will aid the Executive in enforcing existing laws , and which will enable the Congress to enact additional legislation , if any should be found necessary , in order to prevent the few from obtaining privileges at the expense of diminished opportunities for the many . The preliminary work of the Bureau of Corporations in the Department has shown the wisdom of its creation . Publicity in corporate affairs will tend to do away with ignorance , and will afford facts upon which intelligent action may be taken . Systematic , intelligent investigation is already developing facts the knowledge of which is essential to a right understanding of the needs and duties of the business world . The corporation which is honestly and fairly organized , whose managers in the conduct of its business recognize their obligation to deal squarely with their stockholders , their competitors , and the public , has nothing to fear from such supervision . The purpose of this Bureau is not to embarrass or assail legitimate business , but to aid in bringing about a better industrial condition a condition under which there shall be obedience to law and recognition of public obligation by all corporations , great or small . The Department of Commerce and Labor will be not only the clearing house for information regarding the business transactions of the Nation , but the executive arm of the Government to aid in strengthening our domestic and foreign markets , in perfecting our transportation facilities , in building up our merchant marine , in preventing the entrance of undesirable immigrants , in improving commercial and industrial conditions , and in bringing together on common ground those necessary partners in industrial progress capital and labor . Commerce between the nations is steadily growing in volume , and the tendency of the times is toward closer trade relations . Constant watchfulness is needed to secure to Americans the chance to participate to the best advantage in foreign trade and we may confidently expect that the new Department will justify the expectation of its creators by the exercise of this watchfulness , as well as by the businesslike administration of such laws relating to our internal affairs as are intrusted to its care . In enacting the laws above enumerated the Congress proceeded on sane and conservative lines . Nothing revolutionary was attempted but a common sense and successful effort was made in the direction of seeing that corporations are so handled as to subserve the public good . The legislation was moderate . It was characterized throughout by the idea that we were not attacking corporations , but endeavoring to provide for doing away with any evil in them that we drew the line against misconduct , not against wealth gladly recognizing the great good done by the capitalist who alone , or in conjunction with his fellows , does his work along proper and legitimate lines . The purpose of the legislation , which purpose will undoubtedly be fulfilled , was to favor such a man when he does well , and to supervise his action only to prevent him from doing ill . Publicity can do no harm to the honest corporation . The only corporation that has cause to dread it is the corporation which shrinks from the light , and about the welfare of such corporations we need not be oversensitive . The work of the Department of Commerce and Labor has been conditioned upon this theory , of securing fair treatment alike for labor and for capital . The consistent policy of the National Government , so far as it has the power , is to hold in check the unscrupulous man , whether employer or employee but to refuse to weaken individual initiative or to hamper or cramp the industrial development of the country . We recognize that this is an era of federation and combination , in which great capitalistic corporations and labor unions have become factors of tremendous importance in all industrial centers . Hearty recognition is given the far reaching , beneficent work which has been accomplished through both corporations and unions , and the line as between different corporations , as between different unions , is drawn as it is between different individuals that is , it is drawn on conduct , the effort being to treat both organized capital and organized labor alike asking nothing save that the interest of each shall be brought into harmony with the interest of the general public , and that the conduct of each shall conform to the fundamental rules of obedience to law , of individual freedom , and of justice and fair dealing towards all . Whenever either corporation , labor union , or individual disregards the law or acts in a spirit of arbitrary and tyrannous interference with the rights of others , whether corporations or individuals , then where the Federal Government has jurisdiction , it will see to it that the misconduct is stopped , paying not the slightest heed to the position or power of the corporation , the union or the individual , but only to one vital fact that is , the question whether or not the conduct of the individual or aggregate of individuals is in accordance with the law of the land . Every man must be guaranteed his liberty and his right to do as he likes with his property or his labor , so long as he does not infringe the rights of others . No man is above the law and no man is below it nor do we ask any man s permission when we require him to obey it . Obedience to the law is demanded as a right not asked as a favor . We have cause as a nation to be thankful for the steps that have been so successfully taken to put these principles into effect . The progress has been by evolution , not by revolution . Nothing radical has been done the action has been both moderate and resolute . Therefore the work will stand . There shall be no backward step . If in the working of the laws it proves desirable that they shall at any point be expanded or amplified , the amendment can be made as its desirability is shown . Meanwhile they are being administered with judgment , but with insistence upon obedience to them , and their need has been emphasized in signal fashion by the events of the past year . From all sources , exclusive of the postal service , the receipts of the Government for the last fiscal year aggregated 560 , 396 , 674 . The expenditures for the same period were 506 , 099 , 007 , the surplus for the fiscal year being 54 , 297 , 667 . The indications are that the surplus for the present fiscal year will be very small , if indeed there be any surplus . From July to November the receipts from customs were , approximately , nine million dollars less than the receipts from the same source for a corresponding portion of last year . Should this decrease continue at the same ratio throughout the fiscal year , the surplus would be reduced by , approximately , thirty million dollars . Should the revenue from customs suffer much further decrease during the fiscal year , the surplus would vanish . A large surplus is certainly undesirable . Two years ago the war taxes were taken off with the express intention of equalizing the governmental receipts and expenditures , and though the first year thereafter still showed a surplus , it now seems likely that a substantial equality of revenue and expenditure will be attained . Such being the case it is of great moment both to exercise care and economy in appropriations , and to scan sharply any change in our fiscal revenue system which may reduce our income . The need of strict economy in our expenditures is emphasized by the fact that we can not afford to be parsimonious in providing for what is essential to our national well being . Careful economy wherever possible will alone prevent our income from falling below the point required in order to meet our genuine needs . The integrity of our currency is beyond question , and under present conditions it would be unwise and unnecessary to attempt a reconstruction of our entire monetary system . The same liberty should be granted the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit customs receipts as is granted him in the deposit of receipts from other sources . In my Message of December 2 , 1902 , I called attention to certain needs of the financial situation , and I again ask the consideration of the Congress for these questions . During the last session of the Congress at the suggestion of a joint note from the Republic of Mexico and the Imperial Government of China , and in harmony with an act of the Congress appropriating 25 , 000 to pay the expenses thereof , a commission was appointed to confer with the principal European countries in the hope that some plan might be devised whereby a fixed rate of exchange could be assured between the gold standard countries and the silver standard countries . This commission has filed its preliminary report , which has been made public . I deem it important that the commission be continued , and that a sum of money be appropriated sufficient to pay the expenses of its further labors . A majority of our people desire that steps be taken in the interests of American shipping , so that we may once more resume our former position in the ocean carrying trade . But hitherto the differences of opinion as to the proper method of reaching this end have been so wide that it has proved impossible to secure the adoption of any particular scheme . Having in view these facts , I recommend that the Congress direct the Secretary of the Navy , the Postmaster General , and the Secretary of Commerce and Labor , associated with such a representation from the Senate and House of Representatives as the Congress in its wisdom may designate , to serve as a commission for the purpose of investigating and reporting to the Congress at its next session what legislation is desirable or necessary for the development of the American merchant marine and American commerce , and incidentally of a national ocean mail service of adequate auxiliary naval crusiers and naval reserves . While such a measure is desirable in any event , it is especially desirable at this time , in view of the fact that our present governmental contract for ocean mail with the American Line will expire in 1905 . Our ocean mail act was passed in 1891 . In 1895 our 20 knot transatlantic mail line was equal to any foreign line . Since then the Germans have put on 23 knot , steamers , and the British have contracted for 24 knot steamers . Our service should equal the best . If it does not , the commercial public will abandon it . If we are to stay in the business it ought to be with a full understanding of the advantages to the country on one hand , and on the other with exact knowledge of the cost and proper methods of carrying it on . Moreover , lines of cargo ships are of even more importance than fast mail lines save so far as the latter can be depended upon to furnish swift auxiliary cruisers in time of war . The establishment of new lines of cargo ships to South America , to Asia , and elsewhere would be much in the interest of our commercial expansion . We can not have too much immigration of the right kind , and we should have none at all of the wrong kind . The need is to devise some system by which undesirable immigrants shall be kept out entirely , while desirable immigrants are properly distributed throughout the country . At present some districts which need immigrants have none and in others , where the population is already congested , immigrants come in such numbers as to depress the conditions of life for those already there . During the last two years the immigration service at New York has been greatly improved , and the corruption and inefficiency which formerly obtained there have been eradicated . This service has just been investigated by a committee of New York citizens of high standing , Arthur Briesen , Lee Frankel , Eugene Philbin , Thomas Hynes , and Ralph Trautman . Their report deals with the whole situation at length , and concludes with certain recommendations for administrative and legislative action . It is now receiving the attention of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor . The special investigation of the subject of naturalization under the direction of the Attorney General , and the consequent prosecutions reveal a condition of affairs calling for the immediate attention of the Congress . Forgeries and perjuries of shameless and flagrant character have been perpetrated , not only in the dense centers of population , but throughout the country and it is established beyond doubt that very many so called citizens of the United States have no title whatever to that right , and are asserting and enjoying the benefits of the same through the grossest frauds . It is never to be forgotten that citizenship is , to quote the words recently used by the Supreme Court of the United States , an inestimable heritage , whether it proceeds from birth within the country or is obtained by naturalization and we poison the sources of our national character and strength at the fountain , if the privilege is claimed and exercised without right , and by means of fraud and corruption . The body politic can not be sound and healthy if many of its constituent members claim their standing through the prostitution of the high right and calling of citizenship . It should mean something to become a citizen of the United States and in the process no loophole whatever should be left open to fraud . The methods by which these frauds now under full investigation with a view to meting out punishment and providing adequate remedies are perpetrated , include many variations of procedure by which false certificates of citizenship are forged in their entirety or genuine certificates fraudulently or collusively obtained in blank are filled in by the criminal conspirators or certificates are obtained on fraudulent statements as to the time of arrival and residence in this country or imposition and substitution of another party for the real petitioner occur in court or certificates are made the subject of barter and sale and transferred from the rightful holder to those not entitled to them or certificates are forged by erasure of the original names and the insertion of the names of other persons not entitled to the same . It is not necessary for me to refer here at large to the causes leading to this state of affairs . The desire for naturalization is heartily to be commended where it springs from a sincere and permanent intention to become citizens , and a real appreciation of the privilege . But it is a source of untold evil and trouble where it is traceable to selfish and dishonest motives , such as the effort by artificial and improper means , in wholesale fashion to create voters who are ready made tools of corrupt politicians , or the desire to evade certain labor laws creating discriminations against alien labor . All good citizens , whether naturalized or native born , are equally interested in protecting our citizenship against fraud in any form , and , on the other hand , in affording every facility for naturalization to those who in good faith desire to share alike our privileges and our responsibilities . The Federal grand jury lately in session in New York City dealt with this subject and made a presentment which states the situation briefly and forcibly and contains important suggestions for the consideration of the Congress . This presentment is included as an appendix to the report of the Attorney General . In my last annual Message , in connection with the subject of the due regulation of combinations of capital which are or may become injurious to the public , I recommend a special appropriation for the better enforcement of the antitrust law as it now stands , to be extended under the direction of the Attorney General . Accordingly by the legislative , executive , and judicial appropriation act of February 25 , 1903 , 32 Stat . , 854 , 904 , the Congress appropriated , for the purpose of enforcing the various Federal trust and interstate commerce laws , the sum of five hundred thousand dollars , to be expended under the direction of the Attorney General in the employment of special counsel and agents in the Department of Justice to conduct proceedings and prosecutions under said laws in the courts of the United States . I now recommend , as a matter of the utmost importance and urgency , the extension of the purposes of this appropriation , so that it may be available , under the direction of the Attorney General , and until used , for the due enforcement of the laws of the United States in general and especially of the civil and criminal laws relating to public lands and the laws relating to postal crimes and offenses and the subject of naturalization . Recent investigations have shown a deplorable state of affairs in these three matters of vital concern . By various frauds and by forgeries and perjuries , thousands of acres of the public domain , embracing lands of different character and extending through various sections of the country , have been dishonestly acquired . It is hardly necessary to urge the importance of recovering these dishonest acquisitions , stolen from the people , and of promptly and duly punishing the offenders . I speak in another part of this Message of the widespread crimes by which the sacred right of citizenship is falsely asserted and that inestimable heritage perverted to base ends . By similar means that is , through frauds , forgeries , and perjuries , and by shameless briberies the laws relating to the proper conduct of the public service in general and to the due administration of the Post Office Department have been notoriously violated , and many indictments have been found , and the consequent prosecutions are in course of hearing or on the eve thereof . For the reasons thus indicated , and so that the Government may be prepared to enforce promptly and with the greatest effect the due penalties for such violations of law , and to this end may be furnished with sufficient instrumentalities and competent legal assistance for the investigations and trials which will be necessary at many different points of the country , I urge upon the Congress the necessity of making the said appropriation available for immediate use for all such purposes , to be expended under the direction of the Attorney General . Steps have been taken by the State Department looking to the making of bribery an extraditable offense with foreign powers . The need of more effective treaties covering this crime is manifest . The exposures and prosecutions of official corruption in Louis , Mo . , and other cities and States have resulted in a number of givers and takers of bribes becoming fugitives in foreign lands . Bribery has not been included in extradition treaties heretofore , as the necessity for it has not arisen . While there may have been as much official corruption in former years , there has been more developed and brought to light in the immediate past than in the preceding century of our country s history . It should be the policy of the United States to leave no place on earth where a corrupt man fleeing from this country can rest in peace . There is no reason why bribery should not be included in all treaties as extraditable . The recent amended treaty with Mexico , whereby this crime was put in the list of extraditable offenses , has established a salutary precedent in this regard . Under this treaty the State Department has asked , and Mexico has granted , the extradition of one of the Louis bribe givers . There can be no crime more serious than bribery . Other offenses violate one law while corruption strikes at the foundation of all law . Under our form of Government all authority is vested in the people and by them delegated to those who represent them in official capacity . There can be no offense heavier than that of him in whom such a sacred trust has been reposed , who sells it for his own gain and enrichment and no less heavy is the offense of the bribe giver . He is worse than the thief , for the thief robs the individual , while the corrupt official plunders an entire city or State . He is as wicked as the murderer , for the murderer may only take one life against the law , while the corrupt official and the man who corrupts the official alike aim at the assassination of the commonwealth itself . Government of the people , by the people , for the people will perish from the face of the earth if bribery is tolerated . The givers and takers of bribes stand on an evil pre eminence of infamy . The exposure and punishment of public corruption is an honor to a nation , not a disgrace . The shame lies in toleration , not in correction . No city or State , still less the Nation , can be injured by the enforcement of law . As long as public plunderers when detected can find a haven of refuge in any foreign land and avoid punishment , just so long encouragement is given them to continue their practices . If we fail to do all that in us lies to stamp out corruption we can not escape our share of responsibility for the guilt . The first requisite of successful self government is unflinching enforcement of the law and the cutting out of corruption . For several years past the rapid development of Alaska and the establishment of growing American interests in regions theretofore unsurveyed and imperfectly known brought into prominence the urgent necessity of a practical demarcation of the boundaries between the jurisdictions of the United States and Great Britain . Although the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia , the provisions of which were copied in the treaty of 1867 , whereby Russia conveyed Alaska to the United States , was positive as to the control , first by Russia and later by the United States , of a strip of territory along the continental mainland from the western shore of Portland Canal to Mount Elias , following and surrounding the indentations of the coast and including the islands to the westward , its description of the landward margin of the strip was indefinite , resting on the supposed existence of a continuous ridge or range of mountains skirting the coast , as figured in the charts of the early navigators . It had at no time been possible for either party in interest to lay down , under the authority of the treaty , a line so obviously exact according to its provisions as to command the assent of the other . For nearly three fourths of a century the absence of tangible local interests demanding the exercise of positive jurisdiction on either side of the border left the question dormant . In 1878 questions of revenue administration on the Stikine River led to the establishment of a provisional demarcation , crossing the channel between two high peaks on either side about twenty four miles above the river mouth . In 1899 similar questions growing out of the extraordinary development of mining interests in the region about the head of Lynn Canal brought about a temporary modus vivendi , by which a convenient separation was made at the watershed divides of the White and Chilkoot passes and to the north of Klukwan , on the Klehini River . These partial and tentative adjustments could not , in the very nature of things , be satisfactory or lasting . A permanent disposition of the matter became imperative . After unavailing attempts to reach an understanding through a Joint High Commission , followed by prolonged negotiations , conducted in an amicable spirit , a convention between the United States and Great Britain was signed , January 24 , 1903 , providing for an examination of the subject by a mixed tribunal of six members , three on a side , with a view to its final disposition . Ratifications were exchanged on March 3 last , whereupon the two Governments appointed their respective members . Those on behalf of the United States were Elihu Root , Secretary of War , Henry Cabot Lodge , a Senator of the United States , and George Turner , an ex Senator of the United States , while Great Britain named the Right Honourable Lord Alverstone , Lord Chief Justice of England , Sir Louis Amable Jette , G . , retired judge of the Supreme Court of Quebec , and Aylesworth , C . , of Toronto . This Tribunal met in London on September 3 , under the Presidency of Lord Alverstone . The proceedings were expeditious , and marked by a friendly and conscientious spirit . The respective cases , counter cases , and arguments presented the issues clearly and fully . On the 20th of October a majority of the Tribunal reached and signed an agreement on all the questions submitted by the terms of the Convention . By this award the right of the United States to the control of a continuous strip or border of the mainland shore , skirting all the tide water inlets and sinuosities of the coast , is confirmed the entrance to Portland Canal concerning which legitimate doubt appeared is defined as passing by Tongass Inlet and to the northwestward of Wales and Pearse islands a line is drawn from the head of Portland Canal to the fifty sixth degree of north latitude and the interior border line of the strip is fixed by lines connecting certain mountain summits lying between Portland Canal and Mount Elias , and running along the crest of the divide separating the coast slope from the inland watershed at the only part of the frontier where the drainage ridge approaches the coast within the distance of ten marine leagues stipulated by the treaty as the extreme width of the strip around the heads of Lynn Canal and its branches . While the line so traced follows the provisional demarcation of 1878 at the crossing of the Stikine River , and that of 1899 at the summits of the White and Chilkoot passes , it runs much farther inland from the Klehini than the temporary line of the later modus vivendi , and leaves the entire mining district of the Porcupine River and Glacier Creek within the jurisdiction of the United States . The result is satisfactory in every way . It is of great material advantage to our people in the Far Northwest . It has removed from the field of discussion and possible danger a question liable to become more acutely accentuated with each passing year . Finally , it has furnished a signal proof of the fairness and good will with which two friendly nations can approach and determine issues involving national sovereignty and by their nature incapable of submission to a third power for adjudication . The award is self executing on the vital points . To make it effective as regards the others it only remains for the two Governments to appoint , each on its own behalf , one or more scientific experts , who shall , with all convenient speed , proceed together to lay down the boundary line in accordance with the decision of the majority of the Tribunal . I recommend that the Congress make adequate provision for the appointment , compensation , and expenses of the members to serve on this joint boundary commission on the part of the United States . It will be remembered that during the second session of the last Congress Great Britain , Germany , and Italy formed an alliance for the purpose of blockading the ports of Venezuela and using such other means of pressure as would secure a settlement of claims due , as they alleged , to certain of their subjects . Their employment of force for the collection of these claims was terminated by an agreement brought about through the offices of the diplomatic representatives of the United States at Caracas and the Government at Washington , thereby ending a situation which was bound to cause increasing friction , and which jeoparded the peace of the continent . Under this agreement Venezuela agreed to set apart a certain percentage of the customs receipts of two of her ports to be applied to the payment of whatever obligations might be ascertained by mixed commissions appointed for that purpose to be due from her , not only to the three powers already mentioned , whose proceedings against her had resulted in a state of war , but also to the United States , France , Spain , Belgium , the Netherlands , Sweden and Norway , and Mexico , who had not employed force for the collection of the claims alleged to be due to certain of their citizens . A demand was then made by the so called blockading powers that the sums ascertained to be due to their citizens by such mixed commissions should be accorded payment in full before anything was paid upon the claims of any of the so called peace powers . Venezuela , on the other hand , insisted that all her creditors should be paid upon a basis of exact equality . During the efforts to adjust this dispute it was suggested by the powers in interest that it should be referred to me for decision , but I was clearly of the opinion that a far wiser course would be to submit the question to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague . It seemed to me to offer an admirable opportunity to advance the practice of the peaceful settlement of disputes between nations and to secure for the Hague Tribunal a memorable increase of its practical importance . The nations interested in the controversy were so numerous and in many instances so powerful as to make it evident that beneficent results would follow from their appearance at the same time before the bar of that august tribunal of peace . Our hopes in that regard have been realized . Russia and Austria are represented in the persons of the learned and distinguished jurists who compose the Tribunal , while Great Britain , Germany , France , Spain , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands , Sweden and Norway , Mexico , the United States , and Venezuela are represented by their respective agents and counsel . Such an imposing concourse of nations presenting their arguments to and invoking the decision of that high court of international justice and international peace can hardly fail to secure a like submission of many future controversies . The nations now appearing there will find it far easier to appear there a second time , while no nation can imagine its just pride will be lessened by following the example now presented . This triumph of the principle of international arbitration is a subject of warm congratulation and offers a happy augury for the peace of the world . There seems good ground for the belief that there has been a real growth among the civilized nations of a sentiment which will permit a gradual substitution of other methods than the method of war in the settlement of disputes . It is not pretended that as yet we are near a position in which it will be possible wholly to prevent war , or that a just regard for national interest and honor will in all cases permit of the settlement of international disputes by arbitration . but by a mixture of prudence and firmness with wisdom we think it is possible to do away with much of the provocation and excuse for war , and at least in many cases to substitute some other and more rational method for the settlement of disputes . The Hague Court offers so good an example of what can be done in the direction of such settlement that it should be encouraged in every way . Further steps should be taken . In President McKinley s annual Message of December 5 , 1898 , he made the following recommendation The experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense of the burdens and the waste of war . We desire in common with most civilized nations , to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage sustained in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce . It is true we may suffer in such cases less than other communities , but all nations are damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehension into which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire commercial world . It should be our object , therefore , to minimize , so far as practicable , this inevitable loss and disturbance . This purpose can probably best be accomplished by an international agreement to regard all private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by the forces of belligerent powers . The United States Government has for many years advocated this humane and beneficent principle , and is now in a position to recommend it to other powers without the imputation of selfish motives . I therefore suggest for your consideration that the Executive be authorized to correspond with the governments of the principal maritime powers with a view of incorporating into the permanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemption of all private property at sea , not contraband of war , from capture or destruction by belligerent powers . I cordially renew this recommendation . The Supreme Court , speaking on December 11 . 1899 , through Peckham , J . , said It is , we think , historically accurate to say that this Government has always been , in its views , among the most advanced of the governments of the world in favor of mitigating , as to all non combatants , the hardships and horrors of war . To accomplish that object it has always advocated those rules which would in most cases do away with the right to capture the private property of an enemy on the high seas . I advocate this as a matter of humanity and morals . It is anachronistic when private property is respected on land that it should not be respected at sea . Moreover , it should be borne in mind that shipping represents , internationally speaking , a much more generalized species of private property than is the case with ordinary property on land that is , property found at sea is much less apt than is the case with property found on land really to belong to any one nation . Under the modern system of corporate ownership the flag of a vessel often differs from the flag which would mark the nationality of the real ownership and money control of the vessel and the cargo may belong to individuals of yet a different nationality . Much American capital is now invested in foreign ships and among foreign nations it often happens that the capital of one is largely invested in the shipping of another . Furthermore , as a practical matter , it may be mentioned that while commerce destroying may cause serious loss and great annoyance , it can never be more than a subsidiary factor in bringing to terms a resolute foe . This is now well recognized by all of our naval experts . The fighting ship , not the commerce destroyer , is the vessel whose feats add renown to a nation s history , and establish her place among the great powers of the world . Last year the Interparliamentary Union for International Arbitration met at Vienna , six hundred members of the different legislatures of civilized countries attending . It was provided that the next meeting should be in 1904 at Louis , subject to our Congress extending an invitation . Like the Hague Tribunal , this Interparliamentary Union is one of the forces tending towards peace among the nations of the earth , and it is entitled to our support . I trust the invitation can be extended . Early in July , having received intelligence , which happily turned out to be erroneous , of the assassination of our vice consul at Beirut , I dispatched a small squadron to that port for such service as might be found necessary on arrival . Although the attempt on the life of our vice consul had not been successful , yet the outrage was symptomatic of a state of excitement and disorder which demanded immediate attention . The arrival of the vessels had the happiest result . A feeling of security at once took the place of the former alarm and disquiet our officers were cordially welcomed by the consular body and the leading merchants , and ordinary business resumed its activity . The Government of the Sultan gave a considerate hearing to the representations of our minister the official who was regarded as responsible for the disturbed condition of affairs was removed . Our relations with the Turkish Government remain friendly our claims rounded on inequitable treatment of some of our schools and missions appear to be in process of amicable adjustment . The signing of a new commercial treaty with China , which took place at Shanghai on the 8th of October , is a cause for satisfaction . This act , the result of long discussion and negotiation , places our commercial relations with the great Oriental Empire on a more satisfactory footing than they have ever heretofore enjoyed . It provides not only for the ordinary rights and privileges of diplomatic and consular officers , but also for an important extension of our commerce by increased facility of access to Chinese ports , and for the relief of trade by the removal of some of the obstacles which have embarrassed it in the past . The Chinese Government engages , on fair and equitable conditions , which will probably be accepted by the principal commercial nations , to abandon the levy of liken and other transit dues throughout the Empire , and to introduce other desirable administrative reforms . Larger facilities are to be given to our citizens who desire to carry on mining enterprises in China . We have secured for our missionaries a valuable privilege , the recognition of their right to rent and lease in perpetuity such property as their religious societies may need in all parts of the Empire . And , what was an indispensable condition for the advance and development of our commerce in Manchuria , China , by treaty with us , has opened to foreign commerce the cities of Mukden , the capital of the province of Manchuria , and An tung , an important port on the Yalu River , on the road to Korea . The full measure of development which our commerce may rightfully expect can hardly be looked for until the settlement of the present abnormal state of things in the Empire but the foundation for such development has at last been laid . I call your attention to the reduced cost in maintaining the consular service for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1903 , as shown in the annual report of the Auditor for the State and other Departments , as compared with the year previous . For the year under consideration the excess of expenditures over receipts on account of the consular service amounted to 26 , 125 . 12 , as against 96 , 972 . 50 for the year ending June 30 , 1902 , and 147 , 040 . 16 for the year ending June 30 , 1901 . This is the best showing in this respect for the consular service for the past fourteen years , and the reduction in the cost of the service to the Government has been made in spite of the fact that the expenditures for the year in question were more than 20 , 000 greater than for the previous year . The rural free delivery service has been steadily extended . The attention of the Congress is asked to the question of the compensation of the letter carriers and clerks engaged in the postal service , especially on the new rural free delivery routes . More routes have been installed since the first of July last than in any like period in the Department s history . While a due regard to economy must be kept in mind in the establishment of new routes , yet the extension of the rural free delivery system must be continued , for reasons of sound public policy . No governmental movement of recent years has resulted in greater immediate benefit to the people of the country districts . Rural free delivery , taken in connection with the telephone , the bicycle , and the trolley , accomplishes much toward lessening the isolation of farm life and making it brighter and more attractive . In the immediate past the lack of just such facilities as these has driven many of the more active and restless young men and women from the farms to the cities for they rebelled at loneliness and lack of mental companionship . It is unhealthy and undesirable for the cities to grow at the expense of the country and rural free delivery is not only a good thing in itself , but is good because it is one of the causes which check this unwholesome tendency towards the urban concentration of our population at the expense of the country districts . It is for the same reason that we sympathize with and approve of the policy of building good roads . The movement for good roads is one fraught with the greatest benefit to the country districts . I trust that the Congress will continue to favor in all proper ways the Louisiana Purchase Exposition . This Exposition commemorates the Louisiana purchase , which was the first great step in the expansion which made us a continental nation . The expedition of Lewis and Clark across the continent followed thereon , and marked the beginning of the process of exploration and colonization which thrust our national boundaries to the Pacific . The acquisition of the Oregon country , including the present States of Oregon and Washington , was a fact of immense importance in our history first giving us our place on the Pacific seaboard , and making ready the way for our ascendency in the commerce of the greatest of the oceans . The centennial of our establishment upon the western coast by the expedition of Lewis and Clark is to be celebrated at Portland , Oregon , by an exposition in the summer of 1905 , and this event should receive recognition and support from the National Government . I call your special attention to the Territory of Alaska . The country is developing rapidly , and it has an assured future . The mineral wealth is great and has as yet hardly been tapped . The fisheries , if wisely handled and kept under national control , will be a business as permanent as any other , and of the utmost importance to the people . The forests if properly guarded will form another great source of wealth . Portions of Alaska are fitted for farming and stock raising , although the methods must be adapted to the peculiar conditions of the country . Alaska is situated in the far north but so are Norway and Sweden and Finland and Alaska can prosper and play its part in the New World just as those nations have prospered and played their parts in the Old World . Proper land laws should be enacted and the survey of the public lands immediately begun . Coal land laws should be provided whereby the coal land entryman may make his location and secure patent under methods kindred to those now prescribed for homestead and mineral entrymen . Salmon hatcheries , exclusively under Government control , should be established . The cable should be extended from Sitka westward . Wagon roads and trails should be built , and the building of railroads promoted in all legitimate ways . Light houses should be built along the coast . Attention should be paid to the needs of the Alaska Indians provision should be made for an officer , with deputies , to study their needs , relieve their immediate wants , and help them adapt themselves to the new conditions . The commission appointed to investigate , during the season of 1903 , the condition and needs of the Alaskan salmon fisheries , has finished its work in the field , and is preparing a detailed report thereon . A preliminary report reciting the measures immediately required for the protection and preservation of the salmon industry has already been submitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor for his attention and for the needed action . I recommend that an appropriation be made for building light houses in Hawaii , and taking possession of those already built . The Territory should be reimbursed for whatever amounts it has already expended for light houses . The governor should be empowered to suspend or remove any official appointed by him , without submitting the matter to the legislature . Of our insular possessions the Philippines and Porto Rico it is gratifying to say that their steady progress has been such as to make it unnecessary to spend much time in discussing them . Yet the Congress should ever keep in mind that a peculiar obligation rests upon us to further in every way the welfare of these communities . The Philippines should be knit closer to us by tariff arrangements . It would , of course , be impossible suddenly to raise the people of the islands to the high pitch of industrial prosperity and of governmental efficiency to which they will in the end by degrees attain and the caution and moderation shown in developing them have been among the main reasons why this development has hitherto gone on so smoothly . Scrupulous care has been taken in the choice of governmental agents , and the entire elimination of partisan politics from the public service . The condition of the islanders is in material things far better than ever before , while their governmental , intellectual , and moral advance has kept pace with their material advance . No one people ever benefited another people more than we have benefited the Filipinos by taking possession of the islands . The cash receipts of the General Land Office for the last fiscal year were 11 , 024 , 743 . 65 , an increase of 4 , 762 , 816 . 47 over the preceding year . Of this sum , approximately , 8 , 461 , 493 will go to the credit of the fund for the reclamation of arid land , making the total of this fund , up to the 30th of June , 1903 , approximately , 16 , 191 , 836 . A gratifying disposition has been evinced by those having unlawful inclosures of public land to remove their fences . Nearly two million acres so inclosed have been thrown open on demand . In but comparatively few cases has it been necessary to go into court to accomplish this purpose . This work will be vigorously prosecuted until all unlawful inclosures have been removed . Experience has shown that in the western States themselves , as well as in the rest of the country , there is widespread conviction that certain of the public land laws and the resulting administrative practice no longer meet the present needs . The character and uses of the remaining public lands differ widely from those of the public lands which Congress had especially in view when these laws were passed . The rapidly increasing rate of disposal of the public lands is not followed by a corresponding increase in home building . There is a tendency to mass in large holdings public lands , especially timber and grazing lands , and thereby to retard settlement . I renew and emphasize my recommendation of last year that so far as they are available for agriculture in its broadest sense , and to whatever extent they may be reclaimed under the national irrigation law , the remaining public lands should be held rigidly for the home builder . The attention of the Congress is especially directed to the timber and stone law , the desert land law , and the commutation clause of the homestead law , which in their operation have in many respects conflicted with wise public land policy . The discussions in the Congress and elsewhere have made it evident that there is a wide divergence of opinions between those holding opposite views on these subjects and that the opposing sides have strong and convinced representatives of weight both within and without the Congress the differences being not only as to matters of opinion but as to matters of fact . In order that definite information may be available for the use of the Congress , I have appointed a commission composed of Richards , Commissioner of the General Land Office Gifford Pinchot , Chief of the Bureau of Forestry of the Department of Agriculture , and Newell , Chief Hydrographer of the Geological Survey , to report at the earliest practicable moment upon the condition , operation , and effect of the present land laws and on the use , condition , disposal , and settlement of the public lands . The commission will report especially what changes in organization , laws , regulations , and practice affecting the public lands are needed to effect the largest practicable disposition of the public lands to actual settlers who will build permanent homes upon them , and to secure in permanence the fullest and most effective use of the resources of the public lands and it will make such other reports and recommendations as its study of these questions may suggest . The commission is to report immediately upon those points concerning which its judgment is clear on any point upon which it has doubt it will take the time necessary to make investigation and reach a final judgment . The work of reclamation of the arid lands of the West is progressing steadily and satisfactorily under the terms of the law setting aside the proceeds from the disposal of public lands . The corps of engineers known as the Reclamation Service , which is conducting the surveys and examinations , has been thoroughly organized , especial pains being taken to secure under the civil service rules a body of skilled , experienced , and efficient men . Surveys and examinations are progressing throughout the arid States and Territories , plans for reclaiming works being prepared and passed upon by boards of engineers before approval by the Secretary of the Interior . In Arizona and Nevada , in localities where such work is pre eminently needed , construction has already been begun . In other parts of the arid West various projects are well advanced towards the drawing up of contracts , these being delayed in part by necessities of reaching agreements or understanding as regards rights of way or acquisition of real estate . Most of the works contemplated for construction are of national importance , involving interstate questions or the securing of stable , self supporting communities in the midst of vast tracts of vacant land . The Nation as a whole is of course the gainer by the creation of these homes , adding as they do to the wealth and stability of the country , and furnishing a home market for the products of the East and South . The reclamation law , while perhaps not ideal , appears at present to answer the larger needs for which it is designed . Further legislation is not recommended until the necessities of change are more apparent . The study of the opportunities of reclamation of the vast extent of arid land shows that whether this reclamation is done by individuals , corporations , or the State , the sources of water supply must be effectively protected and the reservoirs guarded by the preservation of the forests at the headwaters of the streams . The engineers making the preliminary examinations continually emphasize this need and urge that the remaining public lands at the headwaters of the important streams of the West be reserved to insure permanency of water supply for irrigation . Much progress in forestry has been made during the past year . The necessity for perpetuating our forest resources , whether in public or private hands , is recognized now as never before . The demand for forest reserves has become insistent in the West , because the West must use the water , wood , and summer range which only such reserves can supply . Progressive lumbermen are striving , through forestry , to give their business permanence . Other great business interests are awakening to the need of forest preservation as a business matter . The Government s forest work should receive from the Congress hearty support , and especially support adequate for the protection of the forest reserves against fire . The forest reserve policy of the Government has passed beyond the experimental stage and has reached a condition where scientific methods are essential to its successful prosecution . The administrative features of forest reserves are at present unsatisfactory , being divided between three Bureaus of two Departments . It is therefore recommended that all matters pertaining to forest reserves , except those involving or pertaining to land titles , be consolidated in the Bureau of Forestry of the Department of Agriculture . The cotton growing States have recently been invaded by a weevil that has done much damage and threatens the entire cotton industry . I suggest to the Congress the prompt enactment of such remedial legislation as its judgment may approve . In granting patents to foreigners the proper course for this country to follow is to give the same advantages to foreigners here that the countries in which these foreigners dwell extend in return to our citizens that is , to extend the benefits of our patent laws on inventions and the like where in return the articles would be patentable in the foreign countries concerned where an American could get a corresponding patent in such countries . The Indian agents should not be dependent for their appointment or tenure of office upon considerations of partisan politics the practice of appointing , when possible , ex army officers or bonded superintendents to the vacancies that occur is working well . Attention is invited to the widespread illiteracy due to lack of public schools in the Indian Territory . Prompt heed should be paid to the need of education for the children in this Territory . In my last annual Message the attention of the Congress was called to the necessity of enlarging the safety appliance law , and it is gratifying to note that this law was amended in important respects . With the increasing railway mileage of the country , the greater number of men employed , and the use of larger and heavier equipment , the urgency for renewed effort to prevent the loss of life and limb upon the railroads of the country , particularly to employees , is apparent . For the inspection of water craft and the Life Saving Service upon the water the Congress has built up an elaborate body of protective legislation and a thorough method of inspection and is annually spending large sums of money . It is encouraging to observe that the Congress is alive to the interests of those who are employed upon our wonderful arteries of commerce the railroads who so safely transport millions of passengers and billions of tons of freight . The Federal inspection , of safety appliances , for which the Congress is now making appropriations , is a service analogous to that which the Government has upheld for generations in regard to vessels , and it is believed will prove of great practical benefit , both to railroad employees and the traveling public . As the greater part of commerce is interstate and exclusively under the control of the Congress the needed safety and uniformity must be secured by national legislation . No other class of our citizens deserves so well of the Nation as those to whom the Nation owes its very being , the veterans of the civil war . Special attention is asked to the excellent work of the Pension Bureau in expediting and disposing of pension claims . During the fiscal year ending July 1 , 1903 , the Bureau settled 251 , 982 claims , an average of 825 claims for each working day of the year . The number of settlements since July 1 , 1903 , has been in excess of last year s average , approaching 1 , 000 claims for each working day , and it is believed that the work of the Bureau will be current at the close of the present fiscal year . During the year ended June 30 last 25 , 566 persons were appointed through competitive examinations under the civil service rules . This was 12 , 672 more than during the preceding year , and 40 per cent of those who passed the examinations . This abnormal growth was largely occasioned by the extension of classification to the rural free delivery service and the appointment last year of over 9 , 000 rural carriers . A revision of the civil service rules took effect on April 15 last , which has greatly improved their operation . The completion of the reform of the civil service is recognized by good citizens everywhere as a matter of the highest public importance , and the success of the merit system largely depends upon the effectiveness of the rules and the machinery provided for their enforcement . A very gratifying spirit of friendly co operation exists in all the Departments of the Government in the enforcement and uniform observance of both the letter and spirit of the civil service act . Executive orders of July 3 , 1902 March 26 , 1903 , and July 8 , 1903 , require that appointments of all unclassified laborers , both in the Departments at Washington and in the field service , shall be made with the assistance of the United States Civil Service Commission , under a system of registration to test the relative fitness of applicants for appointment or employment . This system is competitive , and is open to all citizens of the United States qualified in respect to age , physical ability , moral character , industry , and adaptability for manual labor except that in case of veterans of the Civil War the element of age is omitted . This system of appointment is distinct from the classified service and does not classify positions of mere laborer under the civil service act and rules . Regulations in aid thereof have been put in operation in several of the Departments and are being gradually extended in other parts of the service . The results have been very satisfactory , as extravagance has been checked by decreasing the number of unnecessary positions and by increasing the efficiency of the employees remaining . The Congress , as the result of a thorough investigation of the charities and reformatory institutions in the District of Columbia , by a joint select committee of the two Houses which made its report in March , 1898 , created in the act approved June 6 , 1900 , a board of charities for the District of Columbia , to consist of five residents of the District , appointed by the President of the United States , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , each for a term of three years , to serve without compensation . President McKinley appointed five men who had been active and prominent in the public charities in Washington , all of whom upon taking office July 1 , 1900 , resigned from the different charities with which they had been connected . The members of the board have been reappointed in successive years . The board serves under the Commissioners of the District of Columbia . The board gave its first year to a careful and impartial study of the special problems before it , and has continued that study every year in the light of the best practice in public charities elsewhere . Its recommendations in its annual reports to the Congress through the Commissioners of the District of Columbia for the economical and efficient administration of the charities and reformatories of the District of Columbia , as required by the act creating it , have been based upon the principles commended by the joint select committee of the Congress in its report of March , 1898 , and approved by the best administrators of public charities , and make for the desired systematization and improvement of the affairs under its supervision . They are worthy of favorable consideration by the Congress . The effect of the laws providing a General Staff for the Army and for the more effective use of the National Guard has been excellent . Great improvement has been made in the efficiency of our Army in recent years . Such schools as those erected at Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley and the institution of fall maneuver work accomplish satisfactory results . The good effect of these maneuvers upon the National Guard is marked , and ample appropriation should be made to enable the guardsmen of the several States to share in the benefit . The Government should as soon as possible secure suitable permanent camp sites for military maneuvers in the various sections of the country . The service thereby rendered not only to the Regular Army , but to the National Guard of the several States , will be so great as to repay many times over the relatively small expense . We should not rest satisfied with what has been done , however . The only people who are contented with a system of promotion by mere seniority are those who are contented with the triumph of mediocrity over excellence . On the other hand , a system which encouraged the exercise of social or political favoritism in promotions would be even worse . But it would surely be easy to devise a method of promotion from grade to grade in which the opinion of the higher officers of the service upon the candidates should be decisive upon the standing and promotion of the latter . Just such a system now obtains at West Point . The quality of each year s work determines the standing of that year s class , the man being dropped or graduated into the next class in the relative position which his military superiors decide to be warranted by his merit . In other words , ability , energy , fidelity , and all other similar qualities determine the rank of a man year after year in West Point , and his standing in the Army when he graduates from West Point but from that time on , all effort to find which man is best or worst , and reward or punish him accordingly , is abandoned no brilliancy , no amount of hard work , no eagerness in the performance of duty , can advance him , and no slackness or indifference that falls short of a court martial offense can retard him . Until this system is changed we can not hope that our officers will be of as high grade as we have a right to expect , considering the material upon which we draw . Moreover , when a man renders such service as Captain Pershing rendered last spring in the Moro campaign , it ought to be possible to reward him without at once jumping him to the grade of brigadier general . Shortly after the enunciation of that famous principle of American foreign policy now known as the Monroe Doctrine , President Monroe , in a special Message to Congress on January 30 , 1824 , spoke as follows The Navy is the arm from which our Government will always derive most aid in support of our rights . Every power engaged in war will know the strength of our naval power , the number of our ships of each class , their condition , and the promptitude with which we may bring them into service , and will pay due consideration to that argument . I heartily congratulate the Congress upon the steady progress in building up the American Navy . We can not afford a let up in this great work . To stand still means to go back . There should be no cessation in adding to the effective units of the fighting strength of the fleet . Meanwhile the Navy Department and the officers of the Navy are doing well their part by providing constant service at sea under conditions akin to those of actual warfare . Our officers and enlisted men are learning to handle the battleships , cruisers , and torpedo boats with high efficiency in fleet and squadron formations , and the standard of marksmanship is being steadily raised . The best work ashore is indispensable , but the highest duty of a naval officer is to exercise command at sea . The establishment of a naval base in the Philippines ought not to be longer postponed . Such a base is desirable in time of peace in time of war it would be indispensable , and its lack would be ruinous . Without it our fleet would be helpless . Our naval experts are agreed that Subig Bay is the proper place for the purpose . The national interests require that the work of fortification and development of a naval station at Subig Bay be begun at an early date for under the best conditions it is a work which will consume much time . It is eminently desirable , however , that there should be provided a naval general staff on lines similar to those of the General Staff lately created for the Army . Within the Navy Department itself the needs of the service have brought about a system under which the duties of a general staff are partially performed for the Bureau of Navigation has under its direction the War College , the Office of Naval Intelligence , and the Board of Inspection , and has been in close touch with the General Board of the Navy . But though under the excellent officers at their head , these boards and bureaus do good work , they have not the authority of a general staff , and have not sufficient scope to insure a proper readiness for emergencies . We need the establishment by law of a body of trained officers , who shall exercise a systematic control of the military affairs of the Navy , and be authorized advisers of the Secretary concerning it . By the act of June 28 , 1902 , the Congress authorized the President to enter into treaty with Colombia for the building of the canal across the Isthmus of Panama it being provided that in the event of failure to secure such treaty after the lapse of a reasonable time , recourse should be had to building a canal through Nicaragua . It has not been necessary to consider this alternative , as I am enabled to lay before the Senate a treaty providing for the building of the canal across the Isthmus of Panama . This was the route which commended itself to the deliberate judgment of the Congress , and we can now acquire by treaty the right to construct the canal over this route . The question now , therefore , is not by which route the isthmian canal shall be built , for that question has been definitely and irrevocably decided . The question is simply whether or not we shall have an isthmian canal . When the Congress directed that we should take the Panama route under treaty with Colombia , the essence of the condition , of course , referred not to the Government which controlled that route , but to the route itself to the territory across which the route lay , not to the name which for the moment the territory bore on the map . The purpose of the law was to authorize the President to make a treaty with the power in actual control of the Isthmus of Panama . This purpose has been fulfilled . In the year 1846 this Government entered into a treaty with New Granada , the predecessor upon the Isthmus of the Republic of Colombia and of the present Republic of Panama , by which treaty it was provided that the Government and citizens of the United States should always have free and open right of way or transit across the Isthmus of Panama by any modes of communication that might be constructed , while in turn our Government guaranteed the perfect neutrality of the above mentioned Isthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea might not be interrupted or embarrassed . The treaty vested in the United States a substantial property right carved out of the rights of sovereignty and property which New Granada then had and possessed over the said territory . The name of New Granada has passed away and its territory has been divided . Its successor , the Government of Colombia , has ceased to own any property in the Isthmus . A new Republic , that of Panama , which was at one time a sovereign state , and at another time a mere department of the successive confederations known as New Granada and Columbia , has now succeeded to the rights which first one and then the other formerly exercised over the Isthmus . But as long as the Isthmus endures , the mere geographical fact of its existence , and the peculiar interest therein which is required by our position , perpetuate the solemn contract which binds the holders of the territory to respect our right to freedom of transit across it , and binds us in return to safeguard for the Isthmus and the world the exercise of that inestimable privilege . The true interpretation of the obligations upon which the United States entered in this treaty of 1846 has been given repeatedly in the utterances of Presidents and Secretaries of State . Secretary Cuss in 1858 officially stated the position of this Government as follows The progress of events has rendered the interoceanic route across the narrow portion of Central America vastly important to the commercial world , and especially to the United States , whose possessions extend along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts , and demand the speediest and easiest modes of communication . While the rights of sovereignty of the states occupying this region should always be respected , we shall expect that these rights be exercised in a spirit befitting the occasion and the wants and circumstances that have arisen . Sovereignty has its duties as well as its rights , and none of these local governments , even if administered with more regard to the just demands of other nations than they have been , would be permitted , in a spirit of Eastern isolation , to close the gates of intercourse on the great highways of the world , and justify the act by the pretension that these avenues of trade and travel belong to them and that they choose to shut them , or , what is almost equivalent , to encumber them with such unjust relations as would prevent their general use . Seven years later , in 1865 , Seward in different communications took the following position The United States have taken and will take no interest in any question of internal revolution in the State of Panama , or any State of the United States of Colombia , but will maintain a perfect neutrality in connection with such domestic altercations . The United States will , nevertheless , hold themselves ready to protect the transit trade across the Isthmus against invasion of either domestic or foreign disturbers of the peace of the State of Panama . Neither the text nor the spirit of the stipulation in that article by which the United States engages to preserve the neutrality of the Isthmus of Panama , imposes an obligation on this Government to comply with the requisition of the President of the United States of Colombia for a force to protect the Isthmus of Panama from a body of insurgents of that country . The purpose of the stipulation was to guarantee the Isthmus against seizure or invasion by a foreign power only . Attorney General Speed , under date of November 7 , 1865 , advised Secretary Seward as follows From this treaty it can not be supposed that New Granada invited the United States to become a party to the intestine troubles of that Government , nor did the United States become bound to take sides in the domestic broils of New Granada . The United States did guarantee New Granada in the sovereignty and property over the territory . This was as against other and foreign governments . For four hundred years , ever since shortly after the discovery of this hemisphere , the canal across the Isthmus has been planned . For two score years it has been worked at . When made it is to last for the ages . It is to alter the geography of a continent and the trade routes of the world . We have shown by every treaty we have negotiated or attempted to negotiate with the peoples in control of the Isthmus and with foreign nations in reference thereto our consistent good faith in observing our obligations on the one hand to the peoples of the Isthmus , and on the other hand to the civilized world whose commercial rights we are safeguarding and guaranteeing by our action . We have done our duty to others in letter and in spirit , and we have shown the utmost forbearance in exacting our own rights . Last spring , under the act above referred to , a treaty concluded between the representatives of the Republic of Colombia and of our Government was ratified by the Senate . This treaty was entered into at the urgent solicitation of the people of Colombia and after a body of experts appointed by our Government especially to go into the matter of the routes across the Isthmus had pronounced unanimously in favor of the Panama route . In drawing up this treaty every concession was made to the people and to the Government of Colombia . We were more than just in dealing with them . Our generosity was such as to make it a serious question whether we had not gone too far in their interest at the expense of our own for in our scrupulous desire to pay all possible heed , not merely to the real but even to the fancied rights of our weaker neighbor , who already owed so much to our protection and forbearance , we yielded in all possible ways to her desires in drawing up the treaty . Nevertheless the Government of Colombia not merely repudiated the treaty , but repudiated it in such manner as to make it evident by the time the Colombian Congress adjourned that not the scantiest hope remained of ever getting a satisfactory treaty from them . The Government of Colombia made the treaty , and yet when the Colombian Congress was called to ratify it the vote against ratification was unanimous . It does not appear that the Government made any real effort to secure ratification . Immediately after the adjournment of the Congress a revolution broke out in Panama . The people of Panama had long been discontented with the Republic of Colombia , and they had been kept quiet only by the prospect of the conclusion of the treaty , which was to them a matter of vital concern . When it became evident that the treaty was hopelessly lost , the people of Panama rose literally as one man . Not a shot was fired by a single man on the Isthmus in the interest of the Colombian Government . Not a life was lost in the accomplishment of the revolution . The Colombian troops stationed on the Isthmus , who had long been unpaid , made common cause with the people of Panama , and with astonishing unanimity the new Republic was started . The duty of the United States in the premises was clear . In strict accordance with the principles laid down by Secretaries Cass and Seward in the official documents above quoted , the United States gave notice that it would permit the landing of no expeditionary force , the arrival of which would mean chaos and destruction along the line of the railroad and of the proposed Canal , and an interruption of transit as an inevitable consequence . The de facto Government of Panama was recognized in the following telegram to Ehrman The people of Panama have , by apparently unanimous movement , dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumed their independence . When you are satisfied that a de facto government , republican in form and without substantial opposition from its own people , has been established in the State of Panama , you will enter into relations with it as the responsible government of the territory and look to it for all due action to protect the persons and property of citizens of the United States and to keep open the isthmian transit , in accordance with the obligations of existing treaties governing the relations of the United States to that Territory . The Government of Colombia was notified of our action by the following telegram to Beaupre The people of Panama having , by an apparently unanimous movement , dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumed their independence , and having adopted a Government of their own , republican in form , with which the Government of the United States of America has entered into relations , the President of the United States , in accordance with the ties of friendship which have so long and so happily existed between the respective nations , most earnestly commends to the Governments of Colombia and of Panama the peaceful and equitable settlement of all questions at issue between them . He holds that he is bound not merely by treaty obligations , but by the interests of civilization , to see that the peaceful traffic of the world across the Isthmus of Panama shall not longer be disturbed by a constant succession of unnecessary and wasteful civil wars . When these events happened , fifty seven years had elapsed since the United States had entered into its treaty with New Granada . During that time the Governments of New Granada and of its successor , Colombia , have been in a constant state of flux . The following is a partial list of the disturbances on the Isthmus of Panama during the period in question as reported to us by our consuls . It is not possible to give a complete list , and some of the reports that speak of revolutions must mean unsuccessful revolutions . May 22 , 1850 . Outbreak two Americans killed .

March , 1902 . Revolutionary disturbances . July , 1902 . Revolution . The above is only a partial list of the revolutions , rebellions , insurrections , riots , and other outbreaks that have occurred during the period in question yet they number 53 for the 57 years . It will be noted that one of them lasted for nearly three years before it was quelled another for nearly a year . In short , the experience of over half a century has shown Colombia to be utterly incapable of keeping order on the Isthmus . Only the active interference of the United States has enabled her to preserve so much as a semblance of sovereignty . Had it not been for the exercise by the United States of the police power in her interest , her connection with the Isthmus would have been sundered long ago . In 1856 , in 1860 , in 1873 , in 1885 , in 1901 , and again in 1902 , sailors and marines from United States war ships were forced to land in order to patrol the Isthmus , to protect life and property , and to see that the transit across the Isthmus was kept open . In 1861 , in 1862 , in 1885 , and in 1900 , the Colombian Government asked that the United States Government would land troops to protect its interests and maintain order on the Isthmus . Perhaps the most extraordinary request is that which has just been received and which runs as follows Knowing that revolution has already commenced in Panama an eminent Colombian says that if the Government of the United States will land troops to preserve Colombian sovereignty , and the transit , if requested by Colombian charge d affaires , this Government will declare martial law and , by virtue of vested constitutional authority , when public order is disturbed , will approve by decree ratification of the canal treaty as signed or , if the Government of the United States prefers , will call extra session of the Congress with new and friendly members next May to approve the treaty . An eminent Colombian has the perfect confidence of vice president , he says , and if it became necessary will go to the Isthmus or send representatives there to adjust matters along above lines to the satisfaction of the people there . This dispatch is noteworthy from two standpoints . Its offer of immediately guaranteeing the treaty to us is in sharp contrast with the positive and contemptuous refusal of the Congress which has just closed its sessions to consider favorably such a treaty it shows that the Government which made the treaty really had absolute control over the situation , but did not choose to exercise this control . The dispatch further calls on us to restore order and secure Colombian supremacy in the Isthmus from which the Colombian Government has just by its action decided to bar us by preventing the construction of the canal . The control , in the interest of the commerce and traffic of the whole civilized world , of the means of undisturbed transit across the Isthmus of Panama has become of transcendent importance to the United States . We have repeatedly exercised this control by intervening in the course of domestic dissension , and by protecting the territory from foreign invasion . In 1853 Everett assured the Peruvian minister that we should not hesitate to maintain the neutrality of the Isthmus in the case of war between Peru and Colombia . In 1864 Colombia , which has always been vigilant to avail itself of its privileges conferred by the treaty , expressed its expectation that in the event of war between Peru and Spain the United States would carry into effect the guaranty of neutrality . There have been few administrations of the State Department in which this treaty has not , either by the one side or the other , been used as a basis of more or less important demands . It was said by Fish in 1871 that the Department of State had reason to believe that an attack upon Colombian sovereignty on the Isthmus had , on several occasions , been averted by warning from this Government . In 1886 , when Colombia was under the menace of hostilities from Italy in the Cerruti case , Bayard expressed the serious concern that the United States could not but feel , that a European power should resort to force against a sister republic of this hemisphere , as to the sovereign and uninterrupted use of a part of whose territory we are guarantors under the solemn faith of a treaty . The above recital of facts establishes beyond question First , that the United States has for over half a century patiently and in good faith carried out its obligations under the treaty of 1846 second , that when for the first time it became possible for Colombia to do anything in requital of the services thus repeatedly rendered to it for fifty seven years by the United States , the Colombian Government peremptorily and offensively refused thus to do its part , even though to do so would have been to its advantage and immeasurably to the advantage of the State of Panama , at that time under its jurisdiction third , that throughout this period revolutions , riots , and factional disturbances of every kind have occurred one after the other in almost uninterrupted succession , some of them lasting for months and even for years , while the central government was unable to put them down or to make peace with the rebels fourth , that these disturbances instead of showing any sign of abating have tended to grow more numerous and more serious in the immediate past fifth , that the control of Colombia over the Isthmus of Panama could not be maintained without the armed intervention and assistance of the United States . In other words , the Government of Colombia , though wholly unable to maintain order on the Isthmus , has nevertheless declined to ratify a treaty the conclusion of which opened the only chance to secure its own stability and to guarantee permanent peace on , and the construction of a canal across , the Isthmus . Under such circumstances the Government of the United States would have been guilty of folly and weakness , amounting in their sum to a crime against the Nation , had it acted otherwise than it did when the revolution of November 3 last took place in Panama . This great enterprise of building the interoceanic canal can not be held up to gratify the whims , or out of respect to the governmental impotence , or to the even more sinister and evil political peculiarities , of people who , though they dwell afar off , yet , against the wish of the actual dwellers on the Isthmus , assert an unreal supremacy over the territory . The possession of a territory fraught with such peculiar capacities as the Isthmus in question carries with it obligations to mankind . The course of events has shown that this canal can not be built by private enterprise , or by any other nation than our own therefore it must be built by the United States . Every effort has been made by the Government of the United States to persuade Colombia to follow a course which was essentially not only to our interests and to the interests of the world , but to the interests of Colombia itself . These efforts have failed and Colombia , by her persistence in repulsing the advances that have been made , has forced us , for the sake of our own honor , and of the interest and well being , not merely of our own people , but of the people of the Isthmus of Panama and the people of the civilized countries of the world , to take decisive steps to bring to an end a condition of affairs which had become intolerable . The new Republic of Panama immediately offered to negotiate a treaty with us . This treaty I herewith submit . By it our interests are better safeguarded than in the treaty with Colombia which was ratified by the Senate at its last session . It is better in its terms than the treaties offered to us by the Republics of Nicaragua and Costa Rica . At last the right to begin this great undertaking is made available . Panama has done her part . All that remains is for the American Congress to do its part , and forthwith this Republic will enter upon the execution of a project colossal in its size and of well nigh incalculable possibilities for the good of this country and the nations of mankind . By the provisions of the treaty the United States guarantees and will maintain the independence of the Republic of Panama . There is granted to the United States in perpetuity the use , occupation , and control of a strip ten miles wide and extending three nautical miles into the sea at either terminal , with all lands lying outside of the zone necessary for the construction of the canal or for its auxiliary works , and with the islands in the Bay of Panama . The cities of Panama and Colon are not embraced in the canal zone , but the United States assumes their sanitation and , in case of need , the maintenance of order therein the United States enjoys within the granted limits all the rights , power , and authority which it would possess were it the sovereign of the territory to the exclusion of the exercise of sovereign rights by the Republic . All railway and canal property rights belonging to Panama and needed for the canal pass to the United States , including any property of the respective companies in the cities of Panama and Colon the works , property , and personnel of the canal and railways are exempted from taxation as well in the cities of Panama and Colon as in the canal zone and its dependencies . Free immigration of the personnel and importation of supplies for the construction and operation of the canal are granted . Provision is made for the use of military force and the building of fortifications by the United States for the protection of the transit . In other details , particularly as to the acquisition of the interests of the New Panama Canal Company and the Panama Railway by the United States and the condemnation of private property for the uses of the canal , the stipulations of the Hay Herran treaty are closely followed , while the compensation to be given for these enlarged grants remains the same , being ten millions of dollars payable on exchange of ratifications and , beginning nine years from that date , an annual payment of 250 , 000 during the life of the convention .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives In response to a resolution of the House of Representatives of November 9 , 1903 , requesting the President to communicate to the House if not , in his judgment , incompatible with the interests of the public service , all correspondence and other official documents relating to the recent revolution on the Isthmus of Panama , I transmit herewith copies of the papers called for .

The board of provisional government of the Republic of Panama has appointed Senor Philippe Bunau Varilla envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary near your Government with full powers to conduct diplomatic and financial negotiations . Deign to receive and heed him . ARANGO , Foreign Relations . His Excellency , JOHN HASecretary of State I have the privilege and the honor of notifying you that the Government of the Republic of Panama has been pleased to designate me as its envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary near the Government of the United States . In selecting for its first representative at Washington a veteran servant and champion of the Panama Canal , my Government has evidently sought to show that it considers a loyal and earnest devotion to the success of that most heroic conception of human genius as both a solemn duty and the essential purpose of its existence . I congratulate myself , sir , that my first official duty should be to respectfully request you to convey to His Excellency the President of the United States on behalf of the people of Panama an expression of the grateful sense of their obligation to his Government . In extending her generous hand so spontaneously to her latest born , the Mother of the American Nations is prosecuting her noble mission as the liberator and the educator of the peoples . In spreading her protecting wings over the territory of our Republic the American Eagle has sanctified it . It has rescued it from the barbarism of unnecessary and wasteful civil wars to consecrate it to the destiny assigned to it by Providence , the service of humanity and the progress of civilization . Beaupre to Hay . Fourth , 5 p . m . Confidential . I have been shown telegram from reliable source in Panama to the effect that Isthmus is preparing for secession and that proclamation of independence may be expected soon . The particulars carefully guarded . Reliable information hard to obtain . This Government is evidently alarmed and troops are being sent to Isthmus . Repeat telegrams of importance from United States consul general . His telegrams to me may be interfered with . Hay to Beaupre . The people of Panama having by an apparently unanimous movement dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumed their independence , and having adopted a government of their own republican in form with which the Government of the United States of America has entered into relations , the President of the United States , in accordance with the ties of friendship which have so long and so happily existed between the respective nations , most earnestly . commends to the Governments of Colombia and of Panama the peaceful and equitable settlement of all questions at issue between them . He holds that he is bound not merely by treaty obligations but by the interests of civilization , to see that the peaceful traffic of the world across the Isthmus of Panama shall not longer be disturbed by a constant succession of unnecessary and wasteful civil wars . Beaupre to Hay . November 6 , 6 p . m . Knowing that the revolution has already commenced in Panama , says that if the Government of the United States will land troops to preserve Colombian sovereignty , and the transit , if requested by the Colombian charge d affaires , this Government will declare martial law , and by virtue of vested constitutional authority , when public order is disturbed , will approve by decree the ratification of the canal treaty as signed or , if the Government of the United States prefers , will call extra session of Congress with new and friendly members next May to approve the treaty . General Reyes has the perfect confidence of Vice President , he says , and if it becomes necessary will go to the Isthmus or send representatives there to adjust matters along above lines to the satisfaction of the people there . If he goes he would like to act in harmony with the commander of the United States forces . This is the personal opinion of Reyes , and he will advise this Government to act accordingly . There is a great reaction of public opinion in favor of the treaty , and it is considered certain that the treaty was not legally rejected by Congress . To morrow martial law will be declared 1 , 000 troops will be sent from the Pacific side about the same number from the Atlantic side . Please answer by telegraph . Beaupre to Hay . November 7 , 2 p . m . General Reyes leaves next Monday for Panama , invested with full powers . He has telegraphed chiefs of the insurrection that his mission is to the interests of Isthmus . He wishes answer from you , before leaving , to the inquiry in my telegram of yesterday and wishes to know if the American commander will be ordered to co operate with him and with new Panama Government to arrange peace and the approval of canal treaty , which will be accepted on condition that the integrity of Colombia be preserved . He has telegraphed President of Mexico to ask the Government of the United States and all the countries represented at the Pan American conference to aid Colombia to preserve her integrity . The question of the approval of the treaty mentioned in my telegram of yesterday will be arranged in Panama . He asks that before taking definite action you will await his arrival there , and that the Government of the United States in the meantime preserve the neutrality and transit of the Isthmus and do not recognize the new Government . Great excitement here . Martial law has been declared in the Cauca and Panama . Answer . Beaupre to Hay . November 7 , 6 p . m . As the Government of the United States has war vessels at Panama and Colon , minister for foreign affairs has requested me to ask , Will you allow Colombian Government to land troops at those ports to fight there and on the line of railway Also if the Government of the United States will take action to maintain Colombian right and sovereignty on the Isthmus in accordance with article 35 , the treaty of 1846 , in case the Colombian Government is entirely unable to suppress the secession movement there I am entirely unable to elicit from minister for foreign affairs confirmation of the promises made by Beaupre to Hay . November 9 , 9 a . m . I am desired to inform you by General Reyes that Gen . Bedronel Ospina and Lucas Cabellero , prominent party leaders , accompany him on his mission . Very great excitement here . Large crowds paraded streets yesterday , crying Down with Marroquin . Mass meeting denounced him called for a change of government . Hundreds gathered at the palace , and their orator , a prominent national general , addressed the President , calling for his resignation . Troops dispersed gathering , wounding several . Martial law is declared here , and the city is being guarded by soldiers . Legation of the United States Under strong guard , but apparently no indications of hostile demonstration . The residence of Lorenzo Marroquin attacked with stones . Referring to the questions presented by minister for foreign affairs in my telegram of 7th , I have preserved silence , but bear in mind page 578 , Foreign Relations , part 3 , 1866 , and instructions 134 to minister to the United States of Colombia , 1865 . Hay to Beaupre . Earnestly desiring an amicable solution of matters at issue between Colombia and Panama , we have instructed our consul general at Panama to use good offices to secure for General Reyes a courteous reception and considerate hearing . It is not thought desirable to permit landing of Colombian troops on Isthmus , as such a course would precipitate civil war and disturb for an indefinite period the free transit which we are pledged to protect . I telegraphed you on November 6 that we had entered into relations with the provisional government . Hay to Doctor Herran . Very sincerely , yours , Hay to Beaupre . November 6 , 1903 . The people of Panama having by an apparently unanimous movement dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumed their independence , and having adopted a government of their own , republican in form , with which the Government of the United States of America has entered into relations , the President of the United States , in accordance with the ties of friendship which have so long and so happily existed between the respective nations , most earnestly commends to the governments of Colombia and Panama the peaceful and equitable settlement of all questions at issue between them . He holds that he is bound not merely by treaty obligations , but by the interests of civilization , to see that the peaceable traffic of the world across the Isthmus of Panama shall not longer be disturbed by a constant succession of unnecessary and wasteful civil wars . Herran to Hay . In that telegram your excellency refers to the relations already entered into by the Government of the United States of America with the Colombian rebels who on the evening of the 3rd usurped the power in the capital of the Colombian Department of Panama and imprisoned the lawful civil and military authorities . Your excellency will undoubtedly receive the reply of the Colombian Government through the same channel that was used to forward the notice of which your excellency was pleased to send me a copy , but , in the meanwhile , I am discharging a duty by lodging in advance with your excellency , in the name of my Government , a solemn protest against the attitude assumed in the Department of Panama , by the Government of the United States to the injury of Colombia s rights and in disaccord with the stipulations of article 35 of the still existing treaty of 1846 1848 between Colombia and the United States of America . I reiterate , etc . Hay to Herran . Accept , sir , etc . Tower to Hay . Berlin , November 10 , 1903 . In regard to the report telegraphed from New York that the Colombian consul general there had declared that Colombian citizens had petitioned the Colombian Government to send a deputation to thank the German Government for its offered protection and to make concessions of land to Germany therefor , I have just received the assurance of the German minister for foreign affairs that there is no truth whatever in this report . He added that Germany has no interest in the Panama matter , and that the question of an interference on the part of Germany does not exist . Porter to Hay . The French generally are much pleased with events in Panama and our attitude there . In conversation with minister for foreign affairs he expressed himself in very sympathetic manner . Has authorized French consul at Panama to enter into relations with de facto government . Recognition will no doubt follow in time , and it seems to be disposition of European powers to await formal recognition by the United States before acting . Varilla to Hay . Washington , November 11 , 1903 . I have the very great honor to bring to your knowledge the fact that the Republic of Panama has designated me to fill , near the Government of the United States of America , the post of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary with full powers to negotiate . While begging you , Secretary of State , to transmit to His Excellency the President of the Republic of the United States the substance of the present communication , I venture to ask you to solicit from his kindness the appointment of a date on which tie will authorize me to present to him my letters of credence . I have , etc . BUNAU VARILLA . Loomis to Varilla . Washington , November 12 , 1903 . You further ask that this information may be communicated to the President and that he will kindly fix a date at which you may present your letters of credence . In reply I have the honor to say that the President will be pleased to receive you for the purpose mentioned to morrow , Friday , at 9 30 a . m . If you will be good enough to call at this Department shortly before the hour mentioned , the Secretary of State will be pleased to accompany you to the White House . Accept , etc . It owes its existence to the outburst of the indignant grief which stirred the hearts of the citizens of the Isthmus on beholding the despotic action which sought to forbid their country from fulfilling the destinies vouchsafed to it by Providence . In consecrating its right to exist , President , you put an end to what appeared to be the interminable controversy as to the rival waterways , and you definitely inaugurate the era of the achievement of the Panama Canal . From this time forth the determination of the fate of the canal depends upon two elements alone , now brought face to face , singularly unlike as regards their authority and power , but wholly equal in their common and ardent desire to see at last the accomplishment of the heroic enterprise for piercing the mountain barrier of the Andes . The highway from Europe to Asia , following the pathway of the sun , is now to be realized . The early attempts to find such a way unexpectedly resulted in the greatest of all historic achievements , the discovery of America . Centuries have since rolled by , but the pathway sought has hitherto remained in the realm of dreams . To day , President , in response to your summons , it becomes a reality . In accordance with its long established rule , this Government has taken cognizance of the act of the ancient territory of Panama in reasserting the right of self control and , seeing in the recent events on the Isthmus an unopposed expression of the will of the people of Panama and the confirmation of their declared independence by the institution of a de facto government , republican in form and spirit , and alike able and resolved to discharge the obligations pertaining to sovereignty , we have entered into relations with the new Republic . It is fitting that we should do so now , as we did nearly a century ago when the Latin peoples of America proclaimed the right of popular government , and it is equally fitting that the United States should , now as then , be the first to stretch out the hand of fellowship and to observe toward the new born State the rules of equal intercourse that regulate the relations of sovereignties toward one another . I feel that I express the wish of my countrymen in assuring you , and through you the people of the Republic of Panama , of our earnest hope and desire that stability and prosperity shall attend the new State , and that , in harmony with the United States , it may be the providential instrument of untold benefit to the civilized world through the opening of a highway of universal commerce across its exceptionally favored territory . For yourself , Minister , I wish success in the discharge of the important mission to which you have been called . Washington , November 12 , 1903 . Very Respectfully , The PRESIDENT .

Everything is quiet at Panama .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives The Congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity . On the sixth of September , President McKinley was shot by an anarchist while attending the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo , and died in that city on the fourteenth of that month . Of the last seven elected Presidents , he is the third who has been murdered , and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens . Moreover , the circumstances of this , the third assassination of an American President , have a peculiarly sinister significance . Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in history President Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war , and President Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office seeker . President McKinley was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all governments , good and bad alike , who are against any form of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws , and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people s sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot . It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley s death he was the most widely loved man in all the United States while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter animosities incident to public life . His political opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature , the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close associates . To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affections and home virtues which are all important in the make up of national character . A gallant soldier in the great war for the Union , he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations . There could be no personal hatred of him , for he never acted with aught but consideration for the welfare of others . No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life . The defenders of those murderous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exercised for political ends , inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power . But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged . President McKinley was a man of moderate means , a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil , who had himself belonged among the wage workers , who had entered the Army as a private soldier . Wealth was not struck at when the President was assassinated , but the honest toil which is content with moderate gains after a lifetime of unremitting labor , largely in the service of the public . Still less was power struck at in the sense that power is irresponsible or centered in the hands of any one individual . The blow was not aimed at tyranny or wealth . It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the wage worker has ever had at one of the most faithful representatives of the system of public rights and representative government who has ever risen to public office . President McKinley filled that political office for which the entire people vote , and no President not even Lincoln himself was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well thought out wishes of the people his one anxiety in every crisis was to keep in closest touch with the people to find out what they thought and to endeavor to give expression to their thought , after having endeavored to guide that thought aright . He had just been reelected to the Presidency because the majority of our citizens , the majority of our farmers and wage workers , believed that he had faithfully upheld their interests for four years . They felt themselves in close and intimate touch with him . They felt that he represented so well and so honorably all their ideals and aspirations that they wished him to continue for another four years to represent them . And this was the man at whom the assassin struck That there might be nothing lacking to complete the Judas like infamy of his act , he took advantage of an occasion when the President was meeting the people generally and advancing as if to take the hand out stretched to him in kindly and brotherly fellowship , he turned the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow . There is no baser deed in all the annals of crime . The shock , the grief of the country , are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days , while the President yet hovered between life and death . At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and the breath went from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his murderer , of love for his friends , and of faltering trust in the will of the Most High . Such a death , crowning the glory of such a life , leaves us with infinite sorrow , but with such pride in what he had accomplished and in his own personal character , that we feel the blow not as struck at him , but as struck at the Nation We mourn a good and great President who is dead but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand heroism with which he met his death . When we turn from the man to the Nation , the harm done is so great as to excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most resolute action . This criminal was a professed anarchist , inflamed by the teachings of professed anarchists , and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who , on the stump and in the public press , appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed , envy and sullen hatred . The wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines , and they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaped . This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue , to the exploiter of sensationalism , and to the crude and foolish visionary who , for whatever reason , apologizes for crime or excites aimless discontent . The blow was aimed not at this President , but at all Presidents at every symbol of government . President McKinley was as emphatically the embodiment of the popular will of the Nation expressed through the forms of law as a New England town meeting is in similar fashion the embodiment of the law abiding purpose and practice of the people of the town . On no conceivable theory could the murder of the President be accepted as due to protest against inequalities in the social order , save as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town meeting could be accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts a malefactor in jail . Anarchy is no more an expression of social discontent than picking pockets or wife beating . The anarchist , and especially the anarchist in the United States , is merely one type of criminal , more dangerous than any other because he represents the same depravity in a greater degree . The man who advocates anarchy directly or indirectly , in any shape or fashion , or the man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds , makes himself morally accessory to murder before the fact . The anarchist is a criminal whose perverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion and chaos to the most beneficent form of social order . His protest of concern for workingmen is outrageous in its impudent falsity for if the political institutions of this country do not afford opportunity to every honest and intelligent son of toil , then the door of hope is forever closed against him . The anarchist is everywhere not merely the enemy of system and of progress , but the deadly foe of liberty . If ever anarchy is triumphant , its triumph will last for but one red moment , to be succeeded , for ages by the gloomy night of despotism . For the anarchist himself , whether he preaches or practices his doctrines , we need not have one particle more concern than for any ordinary murderer . He is not the victim of social or political injustice . There are no wrongs to remedy in his case . The cause of his criminality is to be found in his own evil passions and in the evil conduct of those who urge him on , not in any failure by others or by the State to do justice to him or his . He is a malefactor and nothing else . He is in no sense , in no shape or way , a product of social conditions , save as a highwayman is produced by the fact than an unarmed man happens to have a purse . It is a travesty upon the great and holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked in such a cause . No man or body of men preaching anarchistic doctrines should be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder of some specified private individual . Anarchistic speeches , writings , and meetings are essentially seditious and treasonable . I earnestly recommend to the Congress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take into consideration the coming to this country of anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and justifying the murder of those placed in authority . Such individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime , and the law should ensure their rigorous punishment . They and those like them should be kept out of this country and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came and far reaching . provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay . No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the Congress . The Federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the President or any man who by the Constitution or by law is in line of succession for the Presidency , while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our institutions . Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race and all mankind should band against the anarchist . His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations , like piracy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade for it is of far blacker infamy than either . It should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers . Such treaties would give to the Federal Government the power of dealing with the crime . A grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded by the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had just taken the life of the President . The people would have torn him limb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked in his behalf . So far from his deed being committed on behalf of the people against the Government , the Government was obliged at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at the hands of the people . Moreover , his deed worked not the slightest dislocation in our governmental system , and the danger of a recurrence of such deeds , no matter how great it might grow , would work only in the direction of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order . No man will ever be restrained from becoming President by any fear as to his personal safety . If the risk to the President s life became great , it would mean that the office would more and more come to be filled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless in dealing with every friend of disorder . This great country will not fall into anarchy , and if anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its institutions , they would not merely be stamped out , but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines . The American people are slow to wrath , but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame . During the last five years business confidence has been restored , and the nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding prosperity . Such prosperity can never be created by law alone , although it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws . If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any country , if flood or drought comes , human wisdom is powerless to avert the calamity . Moreover , no law can guard us against the consequences of our own folly . The men who are idle or credulous , the men who seek gains not by genuine work with head or hand but by gambling in any form , are always a source of menace not only to themselves but to others . If the business world loses its head , it loses what legislation cannot supply . Fundamentally the welfare of each citizen , and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens which makes the nation , must rest upon individual thrift and energy , resolution , and intelligence . Nothing can take the place of this individual capacity but wise legislation and honest and intelligent administration can give it the fullest scope , the largest opportunity to work to good effect . The tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face , at the beginning of the twentieth , with very serious social problems . The old laws , and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law , were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth . Since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive power of mankind , they are no longer sufficient . The growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the growth of the country , and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has meant a startling increase , not merely in the aggregate of wealth , but in the number of very large individual , and especially of very large corporate , fortunes . The creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action , but to natural causes in the business world , operating in other countries as they operate in our own . The process has aroused much antagonism , a great part of which is wholly without warrant . It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer . On the contrary , never before has the average man , the wage worker , the farmer , the small trader , been so well off as in this country and at the present time . There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth yet it remains true that a fortune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated by the person specially benefited only on condition of conferring immense incidental benefits upon others . Successful enterprise , of the type which benefits all mankind , can only exist if the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success . The captains of industry who have driven the railway systems across this continent , who have built up our commerce , who have developed our manufactures , have on the whole done great good to our people . Without them the material development of which we are so justly proud could never have taken place . Moreover , we should recognize the immense importance of this material development of leaving as unhampered as is compatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom the success of business operations inevitably rests . The slightest study of business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a judgment that the personal equation is the most important factor in a business operation that the business ability of the man at the head of any business concern , big or little , is usually the factor which fixes the gulf between striking success and hopeless failure . An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be found in the international commercial conditions of to day . The same business conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors in international Commercial competition . Business concerns which have the largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are naturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial supremacy among the nations of the world . America has only just begun to assume that commanding position in the international business world which we believe will more and more be hers . It is of the utmost importance that this position be not jeoparded , especially at a time when the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the skill , business energy , and mechanical aptitude of our people make foreign markets essential . Under such conditions it would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our Nation . Moreover , it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with ignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably endangers the interests of all . The fundamental rule in our national life the rule which underlies all others is that , on the whole , and in the long run , we shall go up or down together . There are exceptions and in times of prosperity some will prosper far more , and in times of adversity , some will suffer far more , than others but speaking generally , a period of good times means that all share more or less in them , and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or less degree . It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof of this statement the memory of the lean years which began in 1893 is still vivid , and we can contrast them with the conditions in this very year which is now closing . Disaster to great business enterprises can never have its effects limited to the men at the top . It spreads throughout , and while it is bad for everybody , it is worst for those farthest down . The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries but the wage worker may be deprived of even bare necessities . The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance . Many of those who have made it their vocation to denounce the great industrial combinations which are popularly , although with technical inaccuracy , known as trusts , appeal especially to hatred and fear . These are precisely the two emotions , particularly when combined with ignorance , which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady judgment . In facing new industrial conditions , the whole history of the world shows that legislation will generally be both unwise and ineffective unless undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self restraint . Much of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceedingly mischievous had it not also been entirely ineffective . In accordance with a well known sociological law , the ignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally opposing . In dealing with business interests , for the Government to undertake by crude and ill considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad , would be to incur the risk of such far reaching national disaster that it would be preferable to undertake nothing at all . The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war , for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply remedies . All this is true and yet it is also true that there are real and grave evils , one of the chief being over capitalization because of its many baleful consequences and a resolute and practical effort must be made to correct these evils . There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare . This springs from no spirit of envy or uncharitableness , nor lack of pride in the great industrial achievements that have placed this country at the head of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy . It does not rest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of meeting changing and changed conditions of trade with new methods , nor upon ignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort to accomplish great things is necessary when the world s progress demands that great things be done . It is based upon sincere conviction that combination and concentration should be , not prohibited , but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled and in my judgment this conviction is right . It is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to require that when men receive from Government the privilege of doing business under corporate form , which frees them from individual responsibility , and enables them to call into their enterprises the capital of the public , they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representations as to the value of the property in which the capital is to be invested . Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should be regulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public injury . It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence . Great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions . The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial combinations is knowledge of the facts publicity . In the interest of the public , the Government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in interstate business . Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke . What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation , or taxation , can only be determined after publicity has been obtained , by process of law , and in the course of administration . The first requisite is knowledge , full and complete knowledge which may be made public to the world . Artificial bodies , such as corporations and joint stock or other associations , depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges , should be subject to proper governmental supervision , and full and accurate information as to their operations should be made public regularly at reasonable intervals . The large corporations , commonly called trusts , though organized in one State , always do business in many States , often doing very little business in the State where they are incorporated . There is utter lack of uniformity in the State laws about them and as no State has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts , it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action . Therefore , in the interest of the whole people , the Nation should , without interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself , also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business . This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business . There would be no hardship in such supervision banks are subject to it , and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course . Indeed , it is probable that supervision of corporations by the National Government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a State as Massachusetts , in order to produce excellent results . When the Constitution was adopted , at the end of the eighteenth century , no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes , alike in industrial and political conditions , which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century . At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several States were the proper authorities to regulate , so far as was then necessary , the comparatively insignificant and strictly localized corporate bodies of the day . The conditions are now wholly different and wholly different action is called for . I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the National Government to exercise control along the lines above indicated profiting by the experience gained through the passage and administration of the Interstate Commerce Act . If , however , the judgment of the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power to pass such an act , then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power . There should be created a Cabinet officer , to be known as Secretary of Commerce and Industries , as provided in the bill introduced at the last session of the Congress . It should be his province to deal with commerce in its broadest sense including among many other things whatever concerns labor and all matters affecting the great business corporations and our merchant marine . The course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive and far reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of broadening our markets , securing our business interests on a safe basis , and making firm our new position in the international industrial world while scrupulously safeguarding the rights of wage worker and capitalist , of investor and private citizen , so as to secure equity as between man and man in this Republic . With the sole exception of the farming interest , no one matter is of such vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of the wage workers . If the farmer and the wage worker are well off , it is absolutely certain that all others will be well off too . It is therefore a matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages are higher to day in the United States than ever before in our history , and far higher than in any other country . The standard of living is also higher than ever before . Every effort of legislator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition of things and its improvement wherever possible . Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff , but it should also be protected so far as it is possible from the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by contract , or of those who , coming freely , yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower level . I regard it as necessary , with this end in view , to re enact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely effective . The National Government should demand the highest quality of service from its employees and in return it should be a good employer . If possible legislation should be passed , in connection with the Interstate Commerce Law , which will render effective the efforts of different States to do away with the competition of convict contract labor in the open labor market . So far as practicable under the conditions of Government work , provision should be made to render the enforcement of the eight hour law easy and certain . In all industries carried on directly or indirectly for the United States Government women and children should be protected from excessive hours of labor , from night work , and from work under unsanitary conditions . The Government should provide in its contracts that all work should be done under fair conditions , and in addition to setting a high standard should uphold it by proper inspection , extending if necessary to the subcontractors . The Government should forbid all night work for women and children , as well as excessive overtime . For the District of Columbia a good factory law should be passed and , as a powerful indirect aid to such laws , provision should be made to turn the inhabited alleys , the existence of which is a reproach to our Capital city , into minor streets , where the inhabitants can live under conditions favorable to health and morals . American wage workers work with their heads as well as their hands . Moreover , they take a keen pride in what they are doing so that , independent of the reward , they wish to turn out a perfect job . This is the great secret of our success in competition with the labor of foreign countries . The most vital problem with which this country , and for that matter the whole civilized world , has to deal , is the problem which has for one side the betterment of social conditions , moral and physical , in large cities , and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far reaching questions which we group together when we speak of labor . The chief factor in the success of each man wage worker , farmer , and capitalist alike must ever be the sum total of his own individual qualities and abilities . Second only to this comes the power of acting in combination or association with others . Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage workers , when managed with forethought , and when they combine insistence upon their own rights with law abiding respect for the rights of others . The display of these qualities in such bodies is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves . Finally , there must also in many cases be action by the Government in order to safeguard the rights and interests of all . Under our Constitution there is much more scope for such action by the State and the municipality than by the nation . But on points such as those touched on above the National Government can act . When all is said and done , the rule of brotherhood remains as the indispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for which we strive . Each man must work for himself , and unless he so works no outside help can avail him but each man must remember also that he is indeed his brother s keeper , and that while no man who refuses to walk can be carried with advantage to himself or anyone else , yet that each at times stumbles or halts , that each at times needs to have the helping hand outstretched to him . To be permanently effective , aid must always take the form of helping a man to help himself and we can all best help ourselves by joining together in the work that is of common interest to all . Our present immigration laws are unsatisfactory . We need every honest and efficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen , every immigrant who comes here to stay , who brings here a strong body , a stout heart , a good head , and a resolute purpose to do his duty well in every way and to bring up his children as law abiding and God fearing members of the community . But there should be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of working a threefold improvement over our present system . First , we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who are known to be believers in anarchistic principles or members of anarchistic societies , but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation . This means that we should require a more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid system of examination at our immigration ports , the former being especially necessary . The second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent capacity to appreciate American institutions and act sanely as American citizens . This would not keep out all anarchists , for many of them belong to the intelligent criminal class . But it would do what is also in point , that is , tend to decrease the sum of ignorance , so potent in producing the envy , suspicion , malignant passion , and hatred of order , out of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs . Finally , all persons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American labor . There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an American living and enough money to insure a decent start under American conditions . This would stop the influx of cheap labor , and the resulting competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness in American industrial life and it would dry up the springs of the pestilential social conditions in our great cities , where anarchistic organizations have their greatest possibility of growth . Both the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law should be designed to protect and elevate the general body politic and social . A very close supervision should be exercised over the steamship companies which mainly bring over the immigrants , and they should be held to a strict accountability for any infraction of the law . There is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a national policy . The first requisite to our prosperity is the continuity and stability of this economic policy . Nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time . Doubt , apprehension , uncertainty are exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of our commercial and material well being . Our experience in the past has shown that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce conditions closely approaching panic in the business world . Yet it is not only possible , but eminently desirable , to combine with the stability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocal benefit and obligation with other nations . Such reciprocity is an incident and result of the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy . It was specially provided for in the present tariff law . Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection . Our first duty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case where it is needed is maintained , and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries . Just how far this is must be determined according to the individual case , remembering always that every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad . The well being of the wage worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy of economic legislation . Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home , the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support . The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with foreign nations . Whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided . The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run , directly or indirectly , purchase those surplus products by giving us something in return . Their ability to purchase our products should as far as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor , or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us . It is most important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity . We have now reached the point in the development of our interests where we are not only able to supply our own markets but to produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad . To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties in any case where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protection , or in any case where the article is not produced here and the duty is no longer necessary for revenue , as giving us something to offer in exchange for what we ask . The cordial relations with other nations which are so desirable will naturally be promoted by the course thus required by our own interests . The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis , and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition . I ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor . The condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call for immediate remedial action by the Congress . It is discreditable to us as a Nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant in comparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business . We should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trifling portion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships . To remedy this state of things would not . merely serve to build up our shipping interests , but it would also result in benefit to all who are interested in the permanent establishment of a wider market for American products , and would provide an auxiliary force for the Navy . Ships work for their own countries just as railroads work for their terminal points . Shipping lines , if established to the principal countries with which we have dealings , would be of political as well as commercial benefit . From every standpoint it is unwise for the United States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the distribution of our goods . It should be made advantageous to carry American goods in American built ships . At present American shipping is under certain great disadvantages when put in competition with the shipping of foreign countries . Many of the fast foreign steamships , at a speed of fourteen knots or above , are subsidized and all our ships , sailing vessels and steamers alike , cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed , have to meet the fact that the original cost of building American ships is greater than is the case abroad that the wages paid American officers and seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen of foreign competing countries and that the standard of living on our ships is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial rivals . Our Government should take such action as will remedy these inequalities . The American merchant marine should be restored to the ocean . The Act of March 14 , 1900 , intended unequivocally to establish gold as the standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms of money medium in use with us , has been shown to be timely and judicious . The price of our Government bonds in the world s market , when compared with the price of similar obligations issued by other nations , is a flattering tribute to our public credit . This condition it is evidently desirable to maintain . In many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the banking function but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial crises and financial panics . Moreover , the currency of the country should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and commerce . The collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue to exceed the ordinary expenditures of the Government , thanks mainly to the reduced army expenditures . The utmost care should be taken not to reduce the revenues so that there will be any possibility of a deficit but , after providing against any such contingency , means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs . In his report to the Congress the Secretary of the Treasury considers all these questions at length , and I ask your attention to the report and recommendations . I call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures . The fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing whatever is actually necessary to our well being , should make us doubly careful to husband our national resources , as each of us husbands his private resources , by scrupulous avoidance of anything like wasteful or reckless expenditure . Only by avoidance of spending money on what is needless or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our income to the point required to meet our needs that are genuine . In 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate railways , commonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act . The cardinal provisions of that act were that railway rates should be just and reasonable and that all shippers , localities , and commodities should be accorded equal treatment . A commission was created and endowed with what were supposed to be the necessary powers to execute the provisions of this act . That law was largely an experiment . Experience has shown the wisdom of its purposes , but has also shown , possibly that some of its requirements are wrong , certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of its provisions are defective . Those who complain of the management of the railways allege that established rates are not maintained that rebates and similar devices are habitually resorted to that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper that they drive out of business the smaller competitor that while many rates are too low , many others are excessive and that gross preferences are made , affecting both localities and commodities . Upon the other hand , the railways assert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving carriers of that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to establish and maintain non discriminating rates . The act should be amended . The railway is a public servant . Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike . The Government should see to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy , inexpensive , and effective remedy to that end . At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this Nation flows . Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of these commercial agencies . The subject is one of great importance and calls for the earnest attention of the Congress . The Department of Agriculture during the past fifteen years has steadily broadened its work on economic lines , and has accomplished results of real value in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade . It has gone into new fields until it is now in touch with all sections of our country and with two of the island groups that have lately come under our jurisdiction , whose people must look to agriculture as a livelihood . It is searching the world for grains , grasses , fruits , and vegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities in the several States and Territories where they may add materially to our resources . By scientific attention to soil survey and possible new crops , to breeding of new varieties of plants , to experimental shipments , to animal industry and applied chemistry , very practical aid has been given our farming and stock growing interests . The products of the farm have taken an unprecedented place in our export trade during the year that has just closed . Public opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward a just appreciation of the value of forests , whether planted or of natural growth . The great part played by them in the creation and maintenance of the national wealth is now more fully realized than ever before . Wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest resources , whether of wood , water , or grass , from contributing their full share to the welfare of the people , but , on the contrary , gives the assurance of larger and more certain supplies . The fundamental idea of forestry is the perpetuation of forests by use . Forest protection is not an end of itself it is a means to increase and sustain the resources of our country and the industries which depend upon them . The preservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity . We have come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forest , except to make way for agriculture , threatens our well being . The practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining , grazing , irrigation , and other interests of the regions in which the reserves lie has led to a widespread demand by the people of the West for their protection and extension . The forest reserves will inevitably be of still greater use in the future than in the past . Additions should be made to them whenever practicable , and their usefulness should be increased by a thoroughly business like management . At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the General Land Office , the mapping and description of their timber with the United States Geological Survey , and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the Bureau of Forestry , which is also charged with the general advancement of practical forestry in the United States . These various functions should be united in the Bureau of Forestry , to which they properly belong . The present diffusion of responsibility is bad from every standpoint . It prevents that effective co operation between the Government and the men who utilize the resources of the reserves , without which the interests of both must suffer . The scientific bureaus generally should be put under the Department of Agriculture . The President should have by law the power of transferring lands for use as forest reserves to the Department of Agriculture . He already has such power in the case of lands needed by the Departments of War and the Navy . The wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpful to the interests which depend on water than to those which depend on wood and grass . The water supply itself depends upon the forest . In the arid region it is water , not land , which measures production . The western half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that of our whole country to day if the waters that now run to waste were saved and used for irrigation . The forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States . Certain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the wild forest creatures . All of the reserves should be better protected from fires . Many of them need special protection because of the great injury done by live stock , above all by sheep . The increase in deer , elk , and other animals in the Yellowstone Park shows what may be expected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law and properly guarded . Some of these areas have been so denuded of surface vegetation by overgrazing that the ground breeding birds , including grouse and quail , and many mammals , including deer , have been exterminated or driven away . At the same time the water storing capacity of the surface has been decreased or destroyed , thus promoting floods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams between rains . In cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years , vegetation has again carpeted the ground , birds and deer are coming back , and hundreds of persons , especially from the immediate neighborhood , come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping . Some at least of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection to the native fauna and flora , safe havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing wild animals of the larger kinds , and free camping grounds for the ever increasing numbers of men and women who have learned to find rest , health , and recreation in the splendid forests and flower clad meadows of our mountains . The forest reserves should be set apart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few . The forests are natural reservoirs . By restraining the streams in flood and replenishing them in drought they make possible the use of waters otherwise wasted . They prevent the soil from washing , and so protect the storage reservoirs from filling up with silt . Forest conservation is therefore an essential condition of water conservation . The forests alone cannot , however , fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region . Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters . Their construction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort . Nor can it be best accomplished by the individual States acting alone . Far reaching interstate problems are involved and the resources of single States would often be inadequate . It is properly a national function , at least in some of its features . It is as right for the National Government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind . The storing of the floods in reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our present policy of river control , under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams . The Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works . Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams , the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow . The reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different problem . Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams . The object of the Government is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it . To accomplish this object water must be brought within their reach . The pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along streams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim their holdings . Such opportunities are practically gone . There remain , however , vast areas of public land which can be made available for homestead settlement , but only by reservoirs and main line canals impracticable for private enterprise . These irrigation works should be built by the National Government . The lands reclaimed by them should be reserved by the Government for actual settlers , and the cost of construction should so far as possible be repaid by the land reclaimed . The distribution of the water , the division of the streams among irrigators , should be left to the settlers themselves in conformity with State laws and without interference with those laws or with vested fights . The policy of the National Government should be to aid irrigation in the several States and Territories in such manner as will enable the people in the local communities to help themselves , and as will stimulate needed reforms in the State laws and regulations governing irrigation . The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country , just as the settlement of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic States . The increased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrial production , while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume the larger food supplies and effectually prevent Western competition with Eastern agriculture . Indeed , the products of irrigation will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of mining and other industries , which would otherwise not come into existence at all . Our people as a whole will profit , for successful home making is but another name for the upbuilding of the nation . The necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration of the policy just described . It would be unwise to begin by doing too much , for a great deal will doubtless be learned , both as to what can and what cannot be safely attempted , by the early efforts , which must of necessity be partly experimental in character . At the very beginning the Government should make clear , beyond shadow of doubt , its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public interest . No reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish personal or local interests but only in accordance with the advice of trained experts , after long investigation has shown the locality where all the conditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the greatest usefulness to the community as a whole . There should be no extravagance , and the believers in the need of irrigation will most benefit their cause by seeing to it that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys . Whatever the nation does for the extension of irrigation should harmonize with , and tend to improve , the condition of those now living on irrigated land . We are not at the starting point of this development . Over two hundred millions of private capital has already been expended in the construction of irrigation works , and many million acres of arid land reclaimed . A high degree of enterprise and ability has been shown in the work itself but as much cannot be said in reference to the laws relating thereto . The security and value of the homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rendered in ordinary suits at law . With a few creditable exceptions , the arid States have failed to provide for the certain and just division of streams in times of scarcity . Lax and uncertain laws have made it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual uses or necessities , and many streams have already passed into private ownership , or a control equivalent to ownership . Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders productive , and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong . The recognition of such ownership , which has been permitted to grow up in the arid regions , should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition of the rights of the public in the control and disposal of the public water supplies . Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid regions , where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it , have no proper application in a dry country . In the arid States the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use . In irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and be inseparable therefrom . Granting perpetual water rights to others than users , without compensation to the public , is open to all the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to the public utilities of cities . A few of the Western States have already recognized this , and have incorporated in their constitutions the doctrine of perpetual State ownership of water . The benefits which have followed the unaided development of the past justify the nation s aid and co operation in the more difficult and important work yet to be accomplished . Laws so vitally affecting homes as those which control the water supply will only be effective when they have the sanction of the irrigators reforms can only be final and satisfactory when they come through the enlightenment of the people most concerned . The larger development which national aid insures should , however , awaken in every arid State the determination to make its irrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness that of any country in the civilized world . Nothing could be more unwise than for isolated communities to continue to learn everything experimentally , instead of profiting by what is already known elsewhere . We are dealing with a new and momentous question , in the pregnant years while institutions are forming , and what we do will affect not only the present but future generations . Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and provide homes for the largest number of people , but to create for this new industry the best possible social and industrial conditions and this requires that we not only understand the existing situation , but avail ourselves of the best experience of the time in the solution of its problems . A careful study should be made , both by the Nation and the States , of the irrigation laws and conditions here and abroad . Ultimately it will probably be necessary for the Nation to co operate with the several arid States in proportion as these States by their legislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it . In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the Territory on the traditional American lines . We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own . All our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end in view the well being of the average home maker must afford the true test of the healthy development of the islands . The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system . It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as to Puerto Rico than as to any State or Territory within our continental limits . The island is thriving as never before , and it is being administered efficiently and honestly . Its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the protection of the United States , and upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves . Their material welfare must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of any other portion of our country . We have given them the great gift of free access for their products to the markets of the United States . I ask the attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning the public lands of Puerto Rico . In Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing that before the present session of the Congress closes this will be an accomplished fact . Cuba will then start as her own mistress and to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles , as she unfolds this new page of her destiny , we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes . Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity . In the case of Cuba , however , there are weighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application , and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom , indeed to the vital need , of providing for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imports into the United States . Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we desired . that she should stand , in international matters , in closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power and we are bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interest of her material well being . In the Philippines our problem is larger . They are very rich tropical islands , inhabited by many varying tribes , representing widely different stages of progress toward civilization . Our earnest effort is to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that leads to self government . We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our Nation by making it of the highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves and as an earnest of what we intend to do , we point to what we have done . Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained in the Philippines than ever before in their history . It is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualities without which the institutions of free government are but an empty mockery . Our people are now successfully governing themselves , because for more than a thousand years they have been slowly fitting themselves , sometimes consciously , sometimes unconsciously , toward this end . What has taken us thirty generations to achieve , we cannot expect to have another race accomplish out of hand , especially when large portions of that race start very far behind the point which our ancestors had reached even thirty generations ago . In dealing with the Philippine people we must show both patience and strength , forbearance and steadfast resolution . Our aim is high . We do not desire to do for the islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign governments . We hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropics to make them fit for self government after the fashion of the really free nations . History may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which a masterful race such as ours , having been forced by the exigencies of war to take possession of an alien land , has behaved to its inhabitants with the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown in the Philippines . To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy . Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity . The character of Governor Taft and of his associates and subordinates is a proof , if such be needed , of the sincerity of our effort to give the islanders a constantly increasing measure of self government , exactly as fast as they show themselves fit to exercise it . Since the civil government was established not an appointment has been made in the islands with any reference to considerations of political influence , or to aught else Save the fitness of the man and the needs of the service . In our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines , may be that here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them local self government . It is on this side that our error , if any , has been committed . No competent observer , sincerely desirous of finding out the facts and influenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives , can assert that we have not gone far enough . We have gone to the very verge of safety in hastening the process . To have taken a single step farther or faster in advance would have been folly and weakness , and might well have been crime . We are extremely anxious that the natives shall show the power of governing themselves . We are anxious , first for their sakes , and next , because it relieves us of a great burden . There need not be the slightest fear of our not continuing to give them all the liberty for which they are fit . The only fear is test in our overanxiety we give them a degree of independence for which they are unfit , thereby inviting reaction and disaster . As fast as there is any reasonable hope that in a given district the people can govern themselves , self government has been given in that district . There is not a locality fitted for self government which has not received it . But it may well be that in certain cases it will have to be withdrawn because the inhabitants show themselves unfit to exercise it such instances have already occurred . In other words , there is not the slightest chance of our failing to show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit . The danger comes in the opposite direction . There are still troubles ahead in the islands . The insurrection has become an affair of local banditti and marauders , who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of portions of the Old World . Encouragement , direct or indirect , to these insurrectors stands on the same footing as encouragement to hostile Indians in the days when we still had Indian wars . Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who remains peaceful the fullest and amplest consideration , but to have it understood that we will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath , so we must make it evident , unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demands of civilization and humanity , that while we will do everything in our power for the Filipino who is peaceful , we will take the sternest measures with the Filipino who follows the path of the insurrecto and the ladrone . The heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of the islands for their steadfast loyalty . The Macabebes have been conspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag . I recommend that the Secretary of War be empowered to take some systematic action in the way of aiding those of these men who are crippled in the service and the families of those who are killed . The time has come when there should be additional legislation for the Philippines . Nothing better can be done for the islands than to introduce industrial enterprises . Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to industrial development . The connection between idleness and mischief is proverbial , and the opportunity to do remunerative work is one of the surest preventatives of war . Of course no business man will go into the Philippines unless it is to his interest to do so and it is immensely to the interest of the islands that he should go in . It is therefore necessary that the Congress should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed so that franchises for limited terms of years can be granted to companies doing business in them , and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business men of every kind . Not to permit this is to do a wrong to the Philippines . The franchises must be granted and the business permitted only under regulations which will guarantee the islands against any kind of improper exploitation . But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed , and the capital willing to develop it must be given the opportunity . The field must be thrown open to individual enterprise , which has been the real factor in the development of every region over which our flag has flown . It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation , mining , banking , currency , homesteads , and the use and ownership of the lands and timber . These laws will give free play to industrial enterprise and the commercial development which will surely follow will accord to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them . I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines , to be continued from the Philippines to points in Asia . We should not defer a day longer than necessary the construction of such a cable . It is demanded not merely for commercial but for political and military considerations . Either the Congress should immediately provide for the construction of a Government cable , or else an arrangement should be made by which like advantages to those accruing from a Government cable may be secured to the Government by contract with a private cable company . No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is of such consequence to the American people as the building of a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America . Its importance to the Nation is by no means limited merely to its material effects upon our business prosperity and yet with view to these effects alone it would be to the last degree important for us immediately to begin it . While its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the Pacific Coast and the Gulf and South Atlantic States , it would also greatly benefit other sections . It is emphatically a work which it is for the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible it is one of those great works which only a great nation can undertake with prospects of success , and which when done are not only permanent assets in the nation s material interests , but standing monuments to its constructive ability . I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this subject with Great Britain , conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and respect , have resulted in my being able to lay before the Senate a treaty which if ratified will enable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time , and which guarantees to this Nation every right that it has ever asked in connection with the canal . In this treaty , the old Clayton Bulwer treaty , so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal , is abrogated . It specifically provides that the United States alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without the guaranty or interference of any outside nation from any quarter . The signed treaty will at once be laid before the Senate , and if approved the Congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the building of the canal . The true end of every great and free people should be self respecting peace and this Nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial friendship with all others . Over the entire world , of recent years , wars between the great civilized powers have become less and less frequent . Wars with barbarous or semi barbarous peoples come in an entirely different category , being merely a most regrettable but necessary international police duty which must be performed for the sake of the welfare of mankind . Peace can only be kept with certainty where both sides wish to keep it but more and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining that condition of just and intelligent regard for the rights of others which will in the end , as we hope and believe , make world wide peace possible . The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression to this hope and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment . This same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the Monroe Doctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference . The Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two Americas , as it is of the United States . Just seventy eight years have passed since President Monroe in his Annual Message announced that The American continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European power . In other words , the Monroe Doctrine is a declaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non American power at the expense of any American power on American soil . It is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation in the Old World . Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by one New World power at the expense of any other . It is simply a step , and a long step , toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere . During the past century other influences have established the permanence and independence of the smaller states of Europe . Through the Monroe Doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independence and secure like permanence for the lesser among the New World nations . This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any American power , save that it in truth allows each of them to form such as it desires . In other words , it is really a guaranty of the commercial independence of the Americas . We do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other American state . We do not guarantee any state against punishment if it misconducts itself , provided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of territory by any non American power . Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith . We have not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors . We wish to work with them hand in hand , so that all of us may be uplifted together , and we rejoice over the good fortune of any of them , we gladly hail their material prosperity and political stability , and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fall into industrial or political chaos . We do not wish to see any Old World military power grow up on this continent , or to be compelled to become a military power ourselves . The peoples of the Americas can prosper best if left to work out their own salvation in their own way . The work of upbuilding the Navy must be steadily continued . No one point of our policy , foreign or domestic , is more important than this to the honor and material welfare , and above all to the peace , of our nation in the future . Whether we desire it or not , we must henceforth recognize that we have international duties no less than international rights . Even if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines and Puerto Rico , even if we decided not to build the Isthmian Canal , we should need a thoroughly trained Navy of adequate size , or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our nation is among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships . Unless our commerce is always to be carried in foreign bottoms , we must have war craft to protect it . Inasmuch , however , as the American people have no thought of abandoning the path upon which they have entered , and especially in view of the fact that the building of the Isthmian Canal is fast becoming one of the matters which the whole people are united in demanding , it is imperative that our Navy should be put and kept in the highest state of efficiency , and should be made to answer to our growing needs . So far from being in any way a provocation to war , an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty against war , the cheapest and most effective peace insurance . The cost of building and maintaining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for insuring peace which this nation can possibly pay . Probably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace as we are . There is not a single civilized power which has anything whatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part . All we want is peace and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for our rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to their rights in return , to insure fair treatment to us commercially , and to guarantee the safety of the American people . Our people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon it as the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere . The Navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the Monroe Doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation chooses to disregard it . We desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven and the weakling . It is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out . The ships must be built and the men trained long in advance . Some auxiliary vessels can be turned into makeshifts which will do in default of any better for the minor work , and a proportion of raw men can be mixed with the highly trained , their shortcomings being made good by the skill of their fellows but the efficient fighting force of the Navy when pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively in the war ships that have been regularly built and in the officers and men who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have been trained to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weapons with the highest efficiency . In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt the decisive blows at Manila and Santiago had been launched from two to fourteen years , and they were able to do as they did because the men in the conning towers , the gun turrets , and the engine rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty . Our present Navy was begun in 1882 . At that period our Navy consisted of a collection of antiquated wooden ships , already almost as out of place against modern war vessels as the galleys of Alcibiades and Hamilcar certainly as the ships of Tromp and Blake . Nor at that time did we have men fit to handle a modern man of war . Under the wise legislation of the Congress and the successful administration of a succession of patriotic Secretaries of the Navy , belonging to both political parties , the work of upbuilding the Navy went on , and ships equal to any in the world of their kind were continually added and what was even more important , these ships were exercised at sea singly and in squadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the best possible service out of them . The result was seen in the short war with Spain , which was decided with such rapidity because of the infinitely greater preparedness of our Navy than of the Spanish Navy . While awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and manned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the Philippines and in Cuba , we must not forget that an equal meed of praise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have been struck . The Congressmen who voted years in advance the money to lay down the ships , to build the guns , to buy the armor plate the Department officials and the business men and wage workers who furnished what the Congress had authorized the Secretaries of the Navy who asked for and expended the appropriations and finally the officers who , in fair weather and foul , on actual sea service , trained and disciplined the crews of the ships when there was no war in sight all are entitled to a full share in the glory of Manila and Santiago , and the respect accorded by every true American to those who wrought such signal triumph for our country . It was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898 . If we fail to show forethought and preparation now , there may come a time when disaster will befall us instead of triumph and should this time come , the fault will rest primarily , not upon those whom the accident of events puts in supreme command at the moment , but upon those who have failed to prepare in advance . There should be no cessation in the work of completing our Navy . So far ingenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great war craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas . It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional Battle ships and heavy armored cruisers , with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion for the exact numbers and character I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy . But there is something we need even more than additional ships , and this is additional officers and men . To provide battle ships and cruisers and then lay them up , with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in actual war , would be worse than folly it would be a crime against the Nation . To send any war ship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it have been trained by years of actual sea service , including incessant gunnery practice , would be to invite not merely disaster , but the bitterest shame and humiliation . Four thousand additional seamen and one thousand additional marines should be provided and an increase in the officers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at Annapolis . There is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis . The pretentious and unmeaning title of naval cadet should be abolished the title of midshipman , full of historic association , should be restored . Even in time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out , for only so can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency . The officers and men alike should be kept as much as possible on blue water , for it is there only they can learn their duties as they should be learned . The big vessels should be manoeuvred in squadrons containing not merely battle ships , but the necessary proportion of cruisers and scouts . The torpedo boats should be handled by the younger officers in such manner as will best fit the latter to take responsibility and meet the emergencies of actual warfare . Every detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should be so performed , the officer being kept for his special duty in the sea service . Above all , gunnery practice should be unceasing . It is important to have our Navy of adequate size , but it is even more important that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in the world . This is possible only with highly drilled crews and officers , and this in turn imperatively demands continuous and progressive instruction in target practice , ship handling , squadron tactics , and general discipline . Our ships must be assembled in squadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never long at anchor . The resulting wear upon engines and hulls must be endured a battle ship worn out in long training of officers and men is well paid for by the results , while , on the other hand , no matter in how excellent condition , it is useless if the crew be not expert . We now have seventeen battle ships appropriated for , of which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual service . The remaining eight will be ready in from two to four years , but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them . It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are commissioned . Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons , and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who know how to fight with them . The men must be trained and drilled under a thorough and well planned system of progressive instruction , while the recruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor . Every effort must be made to exalt the main function of the officer the command of men . The leading graduates of the Naval Academy should be assigned to the combatant branches , the line and marines . Many of the essentials of success are already recognized by the General Board , which , as the central office of a growing staff , is moving steadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the whole Navy , under the Secretary . This General Board , by fostering the creation of a general staff , is providing for the official and then the general recognition of our altered conditions as a Nation and of the true meaning of a great war fleet , which meaning is , first , the best men , and , second , the best ships . The Naval Militia forces are State organizations , and are trained for coast service , and in event of war they will constitute the inner line of defense . They should receive hearty encouragement from the General Government . But in addition we should at once provide for a National Naval Reserve , organized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department , and subject to the call of the Chief Executive whenever war becomes imminent . It should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace establishment , and offer material to be drawn on at once for manning our ships in time of war . It should be composed of graduates of the Naval Academy , graduates of the Naval Militia , officers and crews of coast line steamers , longshore schooners , fishing vessels , and steam yachts , together with the coast population about such centers as lifesaving stations and light houses . The American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position in international affairs , not merely in political , but in commercial , matters . It has been well said that there is no surer way of courting national disaster than to be opulent , aggressive , and unarmed . It is not necessary to increase our Army beyond its present size at this time . But it is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency . The individual units who as officers and enlisted men compose this Army , are , we have good reason to believe , at least as efficient as those of any other army in the entire world . It is our duty to see that their training is of a kind to insure the highest possible expression of power to these units when acting in combination . The conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier demand than ever before upon the individual character and capacity of the officer and the enlisted man , and to make it far more difficult for men to act together with effect . At present the fighting must be done in extended order , which means that each man must act for himself and at the same time act in combination with others with whom he is no longer in the old fashioned elbow to elbow touch . Under such conditions a few men of the highest excellence are worth more than many men without the special skill which is only found as the result of special training applied to men of exceptional physique and morale . But nowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most difficult to perfect is the rifleman who is also a skillful and daring rider . The proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased . The American cavalryman , trained to manoeuvre and fight with equal facility on foot and on horseback , is the best type of soldier for general purposes now to be found in the world . The ideal cavalryman of the present day is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the best infantryman , and who is in addition unsurpassed in the care and management of his horse and in his ability to fight on horseback . A general staff should be created . As for the present staff and supply departments , they should be filled by details from the line , the men so detailed returning after a while to their line duties . It is very undesirable to have the senior grades of the Army composed of men who have come to fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority . A system should be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade by grade of those who seem unfit to render the best service in the next grade . Justice to the veterans of the Civil War who are still in the Army would seem to require that in the matter of retirements they be given by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the Navy . The process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in a manner that would render it practically impossible to apply political or social pressure on behalf of any candidate , so that each man may be judged purely on his own merits . Pressure for the promotion of civil officials for political reasons is bad enough , but it is tenfold worse where applied on behalf of officers of the Army or Navy . Every promotion and every detail under the War Department must be made solely with regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit of the man himself . No pressure , political , social , or personal , of any kind , will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any question of promotion or detail and if there is reason to believe that such pressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer concerned , it will be held to militate against him . In our Army we cannot afford to have rewards or duties distributed save on the simple ground that those who by their own merits are entitled to the rewards get them , and that those who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform them . Every effort should be made to bring the Army to a constantly increasing state of efficiency . When on actual service no work save that directly in the line of such service should be required . The paper work in the Army , as in the Navy , should be greatly reduced . What is needed is proved power of command and capacity to work well in the field . Constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commissary departments . Our Army is so small and so much scattered that it is very difficult to give the higher officers as well as the lower officers and the enlisted men a chance to practice manoeuvres in mass and on a comparatively large scale . In time of need no amount of individual excellence would avail against the paralysis which would follow inability to work as a coherent whole , under skillful and daring leadership . The Congress should provide means whereby it will be possible to have field exercises by at least a division of regulars , and if possible also a division of national guardsmen , once a year . These exercises might take the form of field manoeuvres or , if on the Gulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic Sea board , or in the region of the Great Lakes , the army corps when assembled could be marched from some inland point to some point on the water , there embarked , disembarked after a couple of days journey at some other point , and again marched inland . Only by actual handling and providing for men in masses while they are marching , camping , embarking , and disembarking , will it be possible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well and smoothly . A great debt is owing from the public to the men of the Army and Navy . They should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency , so that they may be able to respond instantly to any demand made upon them to sustain the interests of the Nation and the honor of the flag . The individual American enlisted man is probably on the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other army . Every consideration should be shown him , and in return the highest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him . It is well worth while for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to correspond with the increased value of the veteran soldier . Much good has already come from the act reorganizing the Army , passed early in the present year . The three prime reforms , all of them of literally inestimable value , are , first , the substitution of four year details from the line for permanent appointments in the so called staff divisions second , the establishment of a corps of artillery with a chief at the head third , the establishment of a maximum and minimum limit for the Army . It would be difficult to overestimate the improvement in the efficiency of our Army which these three reforms are making , and have in part already effected . The reorganization provided for by the act has been substantially accomplished . The improved conditions in the Philippines have enabled the War Department materially to reduce the military charge upon our revenue and to arrange the number of soldiers so as to bring this number much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit established by law . There is , however , need of supplementary legislation . Thorough military education must be provided , and in addition to the regulars the advantages of this education should be given to the officers of the National Guard and others in civil life who desire intelligently to fit themselves for possible military duty . The officers should be given the chance to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of this art . At West Point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn out men who are good in actual field service too much stress should not be laid on mathematics , nor should proficiency therein be held to establish the right of entry to a corps d elite . The typical American officer of the best kind need not be a good mathematician but he must be able to master himself , to control others , and to show boldness and fertility of resource in every emergency . Action should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raising of volunteer forces . Our militia law is obsolete and worthless . The organization and armament of the National Guard of the several States , which are treated as militia in the appropriations by the Congress , should be made identical with those provided for the regular forces . The obligations and duties of the Guard in time of war should be carefully defined , and a system established by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance . It is utterly impossible in the excitement and haste of impending war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangements have not been made long beforehand . Provision should be made for utilizing in the first volunteer organizations called out the training of those citizens who have already had experience under arms , and especially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may be raised for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the outbreak of war . That the Army is not at all a mere instrument of destruction has been shown during the last three years . In the Philippines , Cuba , and Puerto Rico it has proved itself a great constructive force , a most potent implement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization . No other citizens deserve so well of the Republic as the veterans , the survivors of those who saved the Union . They did the one deed which if left undone would have meant that all else in our history went for nothing . But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our history , all our annals would be meaningless , and our great experiment in popular freedom and self government a gloomy failure . Moreover , they not only left us a united Nation , but they left us also as a heritage the memory of the mighty deeds by which the Nation was kept united . We are now indeed one Nation , one in fact as well as in name we are united in our devotion to the flag which is the symbol of national greatness and unity and the very completeness of our union enables us all , in every part of the country , to glory in the valor shown alike by the sons of the North and the sons of the South in the times that tried men s souls . The men who in the last three years have done so well in the East and the West Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that this remembrance is not lost . In any serious crisis the United States must rely for the great mass of its fighting men upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a permanent profession of the military career and whenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories of the Civil War will give to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to those whose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the battle . The merit system of making appointments is in its essence as democratic and American as the common school system itself . It simply means that in clerical and other positions where the duties are entirely non political , all applicants should have a fair field and no favor , each standing on his merits as he is able to show them by practical test . Written competitive examinations offer the only available means in many cases for applying this system . In other cases , as where laborers are employed , a system of registration undoubtedly can be widely extended . There are , of course , places where the written competitive examination cannot be applied , and others where it offers by no means an ideal solution , but where under existing political conditions it is , though an imperfect means , yet the best present means of getting satisfactory results . Wherever the conditions have permitted the application of the merit system in its fullest and widest sense , the gain to the Government has been immense . The navy yards and postal service illustrate , probably better than any other branches of the Government , the great gain in economy , efficiency , and honesty due to the enforcement of this principle . I recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to the District of Columbia , or will at least enable the President thus to extend it . In my judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the Civil Service Law . It is important to have this system obtain at home , but it is even more important to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions . Not an office should be filled in the Philippines or Puerto Rico with any regard to the man s partisan affiliations or services , with any regard to the political , social , or personal influence which he may have at his command in short , heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save the man s own character and capacity and the needs of the service . The administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the suspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the Army and Navy . All that we ask from the public servant in the Philippines or Puerto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which he makes that country s rule a benefit to the peoples who have come under it . This is all that we should ask , and we cannot afford to be content with less . The merit system is simply one method of securing honest and efficient administration of the Government and in the long run the sole justification of any type of government lies in its proving itself both honest and efficient . The consular service is now organized under the provisions of a law passed in 1856 , which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions . The interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country in the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your attention . Several bills providing for a new consular service have in recent years been submitted to the Congress . They are based upon the just principle that appointments to the service should be made only after a practical test of the applicant s fitness , that promotions should be governed by trustworthiness , adaptability , and zeal in the performance of duty , and that the tenure of office should be unaffected by partisan considerations . The guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign commerce , the protection of American citizens resorting to foreign countries in lawful pursuit of their affairs , and the maintenance of the dignity of the nation abroad , combine to make it essential that our consuls should be men of character , knowledge and enterprise . It is true that the service is now , in the main , efficient , but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set forth in the bills heretofore submitted to the Congress on this subject are enacted into law . In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member of a tribe . The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass . It acts directly upon the family and the individual . Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have already become citizens of the United States . We should now break up the tribal funds , doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands that is , they should be divided into individual holdings . There will be a transition period during which the funds will in many cases have to be held in trust . This is the case also with the lands . A stop should be put upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their allotments . The effort should be steadily to make the Indian work like any other man on his own ground . The marriage laws of the Indians should be made the same as those of the whites . In the schools the education should be elementary and largely industrial . The need of higher education among the Indians is very , very limited . On the reservations care should be taken to try to suit the teaching to the needs of the particular Indian . There is no use in attempting to induce agriculture in a country suited only for cattle raising , where the Indian should be made a stock grower . The ration system , which is merely the corral and the reservation system , is highly detrimental to the Indians . It promotes beggary , perpetuates pauperism , and stifles industry . It is an effectual barrier to progress . It must continue to a greater or less degree as long as tribes are herded on reservations and have everything in common . The Indian should be treated as an individual like the white man . During the change of treatment inevitable hardships will occur every effort should be made to minimize these hardships but we should not because of them hesitate to make the change . There should be a continuous reduction in the number of agencies . In dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation resulting from the liquor traffic . We are doing all we can to save our own Indian tribes from this evil . Wherever by international agreement this same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control , every effort should be made to bring it about . I bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people for the Louis Exposition to commemorate the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase . This purchase was the greatest instance of expansion in our history . It definitely decided that we were to become a great continental republic , by far the foremost power in the Western Hemisphere . It is one of three or four great landmarks in our history the great turning points in our development . It is eminently fitting that all our people should join with heartiest good will in commemorating it , and the citizens of Louis , of Missouri , of all the adjacent region , are entitled to every aid in making the celebration a noteworthy event in our annals . We earnestly hope that foreign nations will appreciate the deep interest our country takes in this Exposition , and our view of its importance from every standpoint , and that they will participate in securing its success . The National Government should be represented by a full and complete set of exhibits . The people of Charleston , with great energy and civic spirit , are carrying on an Exposition which will continue throughout most of the present session of the Congress . I heartily commend this Exposition to the good will of the people . It deserves all the encouragement that can be given it . The managers of the Charleston Exposition have requested the Cabinet officers to place thereat the Government exhibits which have been at Buffalo , promising to pay the necessary expenses . I have taken the responsibility of directing that this be done , for I feel that it is due to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort . In my opinion the management should not be required to pay all these expenses . I earnestly recommend that the Congress appropriate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose . The Pan American Exposition at Buffalo has just closed . Both from the industrial and the artistic standpoint this Exposition has been in a high degree creditable and useful , not merely to Buffalo but to the United States . The terrible tragedy of the President s assassination interfered materially with its being a financial success . The Exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public policy , because it represented an effort to bring into closer touch all the peoples of the Western Hemisphere , and give them an increasing sense of unity . Such an effort was a genuine service to the entire American public . The advancement of the highest interests of national science and learning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable results of scientific expeditions conducted by the United States have been committed to the Smithsonian Institution . In furtherance of its declared purpose for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men the Congress has from time to time given it other important functions . Such trusts have been executed by the Institution with notable fidelity . There should be no halt in the work of the Institution , in accordance with the plans which its Secretary has presented , for the preservation of the vanishing races of great North American animals in the National Zoological Park . The urgent needs of the National Museum are recommended to the favorable consideration of the Congress . Perhaps the most characteristic educational movement of the past fifty years is that which has created the modern public library and developed it into broad and active service . There are now over five thousand public libraries in the United States , the product of this period . In addition to accumulating material , they are also striving by organization , by improvement in method , and by co operation , to give greater efficiency to the material they hold , to make it more widely useful , and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce the cost of its administration . In these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the Federal library , which , though still the Library of Congress , and so entitled , is the one national library of the United States . Already the largest single collection of books on the Western Hemisphere , and certain to increase more rapidly than any other through purchase , exchange , and the operation of the copyright law , this library has a unique opportunity to render to the libraries of this country to American scholarship service of the highest importance . It is housed in a building which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected for library uses . Resources are now being provided which will develop the collection properly , equip it with the apparatus and service necessary to its effective use , render its bibliographic work widely available , and enable it to become , not merely a center of research , but the chief factor in great co operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge and the advancement of learning . For the sake of good administration , sound economy , and the advancement of science , the Census Office as now constituted should be made a permanent Government bureau . This would insure better , cheaper , and more satisfactory work , in the interest not only of our business but of statistic , economic , and social science . The remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled within twelve years . Its progressive development compels constantly increasing outlay , but in this period of business energy and prosperity its receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from 11 , 411 , 779 in 1897 to 3 , 923 , 727 in 1901 . Among recent postal advances the success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked , and actual experience has made its benefits so plain , that the demand for its extension is general and urgent . It is just that the great agricultural population should share in the improvement of the service . The number of rural routes now in operation is 6 , 009 , practically all established within three years , and there are 6 , 000 applications awaiting action . It is expected that the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8 , 600 . The mail will then be daily carried to the doors of 5 , 700 , 000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices , and one third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be covered by this kind of service . The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the Government through the intrenched and well understood abuses which have grown up in connection with second class mail matter . The extent of this burden appears when it is stated that while the second class matter makes nearly three fifths of the weight of all the mail , it paid for the last fiscal year only 4 , 294 , 445 of the aggregate postal revenue of 111 , 631 , 193 . If the pound rate of postage , which produces the large loss thus entailed , and which was fixed by the Congress with the purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public information , were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law , no just exception could be taken . That expense would be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy deliberately adopted for a justifiable end . But much of the matter which enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law , and has secured admission only through an evasion of its require . merits or through lax construction . The proportion of such wrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one half of the whole volume of second class mail . If it be only one third or one quarter , the magnitude of the burden is apparent . The Post Office Department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter application of the law and it should be sustained in its effort . Owing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the Pacific , whatever happens in China must be of the keenest national concern to us . The general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the antiforeign uprisings in China of 1900 , having been formulated in a joint note addressed to China by the representatives of the injured powers in December last , were promptly accepted by the Chinese Government . After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September , setting forth the measures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the joint note , and expressing their satisfaction therewith . It will be laid before the Congress , with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the United States , William Woodville Rockhill , to whom high praise is due for the tact , good judgment , and energy he has displayed in performing an exceptionally difficult and delicate task . The agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powers of the various grounds of complaint , and will contribute materially to better future relations between China and the powers . Reparation has been made by China for the murder of foreigners during the uprising and punishment has been inflicted on the officials , however high in rank , recognized as responsible for or having participated in the outbreak . Official examinations have been forbidden for a period of five years in all cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated , and edicts have been issued making all officials directly responsible for the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of violence against them . Provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign representatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which they can if necessary maintain permanent military guards by dismantling the military works between the capital and the sea and by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign military posts along this line . An edict has been issued by the Emperor of China prohibiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition into China . China has agreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states , societies , and individuals for the losses sustained by them and for the expenses of the military expeditions sent by the various powers to protect life and restore order . Under the provisions of the joint note of December , 1900 , China has agreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed . The Chinese Government has agreed to participate financially in the work of bettering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin , the centers of foreign trade in central and northern China , and an international conservancy board , in which the Chinese Government is largely represented , has been provided for the improvement of the Shanghai River and the control of its navigation . In the same line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for ad valorem duties , and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the United States to assist in this work . A list of articles to remain free of duty , including flour , cereals , and rice , gold and silver coin and bullion , has also been agreed upon in the settlement . During these troubles our Government has unswervingly advocated moderation , and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment which tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more beneficial intercourse between the Empire and the modern world while in the critical period of revolt and massacre we did our full share in safe guarding life and property , restoring order , and vindicating the national interest and honor . It behooves us to continue in these paths , doing what lies in our power to foster feelings of good will , and leaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fair intercourse between China and the nations , on a footing of equal rights and advantages to all . We advocate the open door with all that it implies not merely the procurement of enlarged commercial opportunities on the coasts , but access to the interior by the waterways with which China has been so extraordinarily favored . Only by bringing the people of China into peaceful and friendly community of trade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to fruition . In the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity of treatment , under the conventions , throughout the Empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all other powers . We view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the proceedings of the Pan American Congress , convoked at the invitation of Mexico , and now sitting at the Mexican capital . The delegates of the United States are under the most liberal instructions to cooperate with their colleagues in all matters promising advantage to the great family of American commonwealths , as well in their relations among themselves as in their domestic advancement and in their intercourse with the world at large . My predecessor communicated to the Congress the fact that the Weil and La Abra awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts of our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the part of the claimants , and that in accordance with the acts of the Congress the money remaining in the hands of the Secretary of State on these awards has been returned to Mexico . A considerable portion of the money received from Mexico on these awards had been paid by this Government to the claimants before the decision of the courts was rendered . My judgment is that the Congress should return to Mexico an amount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants . The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep and heartfelt sorrow , to which the Government gave full expression . When President McKinley died , our Nation in turn received from every quarter of the British Empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere . The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people and this sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was assassinated . Indeed , from every quarter of the civilized world we received , at the time of the President s death , assurances of such grief and regard as to touch the hearts of our people . In the midst of our affliction we reverently thank the Almighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind and we firmly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutual respect and good will .<speech_sep>My fellow citizens , no people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours , and this is said reverently , in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength , but with gratitude to the Giver of Good who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of well being and of happiness . To us as a people it has been granted to lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent . We are the heirs of the ages , and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are exacted by the dead hand of a bygone civilization . We have not been obliged to fight for our existence against any alien race and yet our life has called for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away . Under such conditions it would be our own fault if we failed and the success which we have had in the past , the success which we confidently believe the future will bring , should cause in us no feeling of vainglory , but rather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us a full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours and a fixed determination to show that under a free government a mighty people can thrive best , alike as regards the things of the body and the things of the soul . Much has been given us , and much will rightfully be expected from us . We have duties to others and duties to ourselves and we can shirk neither . We have become a great nation , forced by the fact of its greatness into relations with the other nations of the earth , and we must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities . Toward all other nations , large and small , our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friendship . We must show not only in our words , but in our deeds , that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their rights . But justice and generosity in a nation , as in an individual , count most when shown not by the weak but by the strong . While ever careful to refrain from wrongdoing others , we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged ourselves . We wish peace , but we wish the peace of justice , the peace of righteousness . We wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid . No weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us , and no strong power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression . Our relations with the other powers of the world are important but still more important are our relations among ourselves . Such growth in wealth , in population , and in power as this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that rises to greatness . Power invariably means both responsibility and danger . Our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown . We now face other perils , the very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee . Modern life is both complex and intense , and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being . Never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a Democratic republic . The conditions which have told for our marvelous material well being , which have developed to a very high degree our energy , self reliance , and individual initiative , have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial centers . Upon the success of our experiment much depends , not only as regards our own welfare , but as regards the welfare of mankind . If we fail , the cause of free self government throughout the world will rock to its foundations , and therefore our responsibility is heavy , to ourselves , to the world as it is to day , and to the generations yet unborn . There is no good reason why we should fear the future , but there is every reason why we should face it seriously , neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending , unflinching purpose to solve them aright . Yet , after all , though the problems are new , though the tasks set before us differ from the tasks set before our fathers who founded and preserved this Republic , the spirit in which these tasks must be undertaken and these problems faced , if our duty is to be well done , remains essentially unchanged . We know that self government is difficult . We know that no people needs such high traits of character as that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely expressed will of the freemen who compose it . But we have faith that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men of the mighty past . They did their work , they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy . We in our turn have an assured confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and our children s children . To do so we must show , not merely in great crises , but in the everyday affairs of life , the qualities of practical intelligence , of courage , of hardihood , and endurance , and above all the power of devotion to a lofty ideal , which made great the men who founded this Republic in the days of Washington , which made great the men who preserved this Republic in the days of Abraham Lincoln .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation To the people of the United States A terrible bereavement has befallen our people . The President of the United States has been struck down a crime not only against the Chief Magistrate , but against every law abiding and liberty loving citizen . President McKinley crowned a life of largest love for his fellow men , of earnest endeavor for their welfare , by a death of Christian fortitude and both the way in which he lived his life and the way in which , in the supreme hour of trial , he met his death will remain forever a precious heritage of our people . It is meet that we as a nation express our abiding love and reverence for his life , our deep sorrow for his untimely death . Now , Therefore , Theodore Roosevelt , President of the United States of America , do appoint Thursday next , September 19 , the day in which the body of the dead President will be laid in its last earthly resting place , as a day of mourning and prayer throughout the United States . I earnestly recommend all the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship , there to bow down in submission to the will of Almighty God , and to pay out of full hearts the homage of love and reverence to the memory of the great and good President , whose death has so sorely smitten the nation . In Witness Whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , the fourteenth day of September , 1901 , and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty sixth . THEODORE ROOSEVELT By the President JOHN HAY , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>
