To the Congress of the United States No Congress of the United States ever assembled , on surveying the state of the Union , has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time . In the domestic field there is tranquility and contentment , harmonious relations between management and wage earner , freedom from industrial strife , and the highest record of years of prosperity . In the foreign field there is peace , the good will which comes from mutual understanding , and the knowledge that the problems which a short time ago appeared so ominous are yielding to the touch of manifest friendship . The great wealth created by our enterprise and industry , and saved by our economy , has had the widest distribution among our own people , and has gone out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the business of the world . The requirements of existence have passed beyond the standard of necessity into the region of luxury . Enlarging production is consumed by an increasing demand at hom6 and ail expanding commerce abroad . The country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism . The main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity and character of the American people . They have had great faith , which they have supplemented with inighty works . They have been able to put trust in each other and trust in their Government . Their candor in dealing with foreign governments hag commanded respect and confidence . Yet these remarkable powers would have been exerted almost in vain without the constant cooperation and careful administration of the Federal Government . We have been coming into a period which may be fairly characterized as a conservation of our national resources . Wastefulness in public business and private enterprise has been displaced by constructive economy . This has been accomplished by bringing our domestic and foreign relations more and more under a reign of law . A rule of force has been giving way to a rule of reason . We have substituted for the vicious circle of increasing expenditures , increasing tax rates , and diminishing profits the charmed circle of diminishing expenditures , diminishing tax rates , and increasing profits . Four times we have made a drastic revision of our internal revenue system , abolishing many taxes and substantially reducing almost all others . Each time the resulting stimulation to business has so increased taxable incomes and profits that a surplus has been ro , duced . One third of the national debt has been paid , while much of the other two thirds has been refunded at lower rates , and these savings of interest and constant economies have enabled us to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reductions . Under this sound and healthful encouragement the national income has increased nearly 50 per cent , until it is estimated to stand well over 90 , 000 , 000 , 000 . It gas been a method which has performed the secining miracle of leaving a much greater percentage of earnings in the hands of the taxpayers with scarcely any diminution of the Government revenue . That is constructive economy in the highest degree . It is the corner stone of prosperity . It should not fail to be continued . This action began by the application of economy to public expenditure . If it is to be permanent , it must be made so by the repeated application of economy . There is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this time . Last June the estimates showed a threatened deficit for the current fiscal year of 94 , 000 , 000 . Under my direction the departments began saving all they could out of their present appropriations . The last tax reduction brought an encouraging improvement in business , beginning early in October , which w1 , 11 also increase our revenue . The combination of economy and good times now indicates a surplus of about 37 , 000 , 000 . This is a margin of less than I percent on out , expenditures and makes it obvious that the Treasury is in no condition to undertake increases in ditures to be made before June 30 . It is necessary therefor Stuing the present session to refrain from new appropriations for immediate outlay , or if such are absolutely required to provide for them by new revenue otherwise , we shall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced budget . For the first time during my term of office we face that contingency . I am certain that the Congress would not pass and I should not feel warranted in approving legislation which would involve us in that financial disgrace . On the whole the finances of the Government are most satisfactory . Last year the national debt was reduced about 906 , 000 , 000 . The refunding and retirement of the second and third Liberty loans have just been brought to a successful conclusion , which will save about 75 , 000 , 0W a year in interest . The unpaid balance has been arrangedin maturities convenient for carrying out our permanent debt paying Program . The enormous savings made have not been at the expense of any legitimate public need . The Government plant has been kept up and many improvements are tinder way , while its service is fully manned and the general efficiency of operation has increased . We have been enabled to undertake many new enterprises . Among these are the adjusted compensation of the veterans of the World War , which is costing us 112 , 000 , 000 a year amortizing our liability to the civil service retirement funds , 20 , 000 , 000 increase of expenditures for rivers and harbors including flood control , 43 , 000 , 000 public buildings , 47 , 000 , 000 . In 1928 we spent 50 , 000 , 000 in the adjustment of war claims and alien property . These are examples of a large list of items . FOREIGN REIATIONS When we turn from our domestic affairs to our foreign relations , we likewise perceive peace and progress . The Sixth International Conference of American States was held at Habana last winter . It contributed to a better understanding and cooperation among the nations . Eleven important conventions were signed and 71 resolutions passed . Pursuant to the plan then adopted , this Government has invited the other 20 nations of this hemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration , which meets in Washington on December 10 . All the nations have accepted and the expectation is justified that important progress will be made in methods for resolving international differences by means of arbitration . During the year we have signed 11 new arbitration treaties , and 22 more are tinder negotiation . NICARAGUA When a destructive and bloody revolution lately broke out in Nicaragua , at the earnest and repeated entreaties of its Government I dispatched our Marine forces there to protect the lives and interests of our citizens . To compose the contending parties , I sent there Col . Henry Stimson , former Secretary of War and now Governor General of the Philippine Islands , who secured an agreement that warfare should cease , a national election should be held and peace should be restored . Both parties conscientiously carried out this agreement , with the exception of a few bandits who later mostly surrendered or left the country . President Diaz appointed Brig . Gen . Frank McCoy , United States Army , president of the election board , which included also one member of each political party . A free and fair election has been held and has worked out so successfully that both parties have joined in requesting like cooperation from this country at the election four years hence , to which I have refrained from making any commitments , although our country must be gratified at such an exhibition of success and appreciationNicaragua is regaining its prosperity and has taken a long step in the direction of peaceful self government . TACNA ARICA The long standing differences between Chile and Peru have been sufficiently composed so that diplomatic relations have been resumed by the exchange of ambassadors . Negotiations are hopefully proceeding as this is written for the final adjustment of the differences over their disputed territory . MEXICO Our relations with Mexico are on a more satisfactory basis than at any time since their revolution . Many misunderstandings have been resolved and the most frank and friendly negotiations promise a final adjustment of all unsettled questions . It is exceedingly gratifying that Ambassador Morrow has been able to bring our two neighboring countries , which have so many interests in common , to a position of confidence in each other and of respect for mutual sovereign rights . CHINA The situation in China which a few months ago was so threatening as to call for the dispatch of a large additional force has , been much composed . The Nationalist Government has established itself over the country and promulgated a new organic law announcing a program intended to promote the political and economic welfare of the people . We have recognized this Government , , encouraged its progress , and have negotiated a treaty restoring to China completetariff autonomy and guaranteeing our citizens against discriminations . Our trade in that quarter is increasing and our forces are being reduced . GREEK AND AUSTRIAN DEBTS Pending before the Congress is a recommendation for the settlement of the Greek debt and the Austrian debt . both of these are comparatively small and our country can afford to be generous . The rehabilitation of these countries await their settlement . There would also be advantages to our trade . We could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuses the relief which Austria seeks . The Congress has already granted Austria a long time moratorium , which it is understood will be waived and immediate payments begun on her debt on the same basis which we have extended to other countries . PEACE TREATY One of the most important treaties ever laid before the Senate of the United States will be that which the 15 nations recently signed at Paris , and to which 44 other nations have declared their intention to adhere , renouncing war as a national policy and agreeing to resort only to peaceful means for the adjustment of international differences . It is the most solemn declaration against war , the most positive adherence to peace , that it is possible for sovereign nations tomake . It does not supersede our inalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to commit us before the event to any mode of action which the Congress might decide to be wise . it ever the treaty should be broken . But it is a new standard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightened opinion of nations to prevent their governments from beii4 forced into hostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosities . The observance of this covenant , so simple and so straightforward , promises more for the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiated among the nations . NATIONAL DEFENSE The first duty of our Government to its own citizens and foreigners within its borders is the preservation of order . Unless and until that duty is met a government is not even eligible for recognition among the family of nations . The advancement of world civilization likewise is dependent upon that order among the people of different countries which we term peace . To insure our citizens against the infringement of their legal rights at home and abroad , to preserve order , liberty , and peace by making the law supreme , we have an Army and a Navy . Both of these are organized for defensive purposes . Our Army could not be much reduced , but does not need to be increased . Such new housing and repairs as are necessary are tinder way and the 6 year program in aviation is being put into effect in both branches of our service . Our Navy , according to generally accepted standards , is deficient in cruisers . We have 10 comparatively new vessels , 22 that are old , and 8 to be built . It is evident that renewals and replacements must be provided . This matter was thoroughly canvassed at the last session of the Congress and does not need restatement . The bill before the Senate with the elimination of the time clause should be passed . We have no intention of competing with any other country . This building program is for necessary replacements and to meet our needs for defense . The cost of national defense is stupendous . It has increased 118 , 000 , 000 in the past four years . The estimated expenditure for 1930 is 668 , 000 , 000 . While this is made up of many items it is , after all , mostly dependent upon numbers . Our defensive needs do not can for any increase in the number of men in the Army or the Navy . We have reached the limit of what we ought to expend for that purpose . I wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic . Many people at home and abroad , who constantly make this charge , are the same ones who are even more solicitous to have us extend assistance to foreign countries . When such assistance is granted , the inevitable result is that we have foreign interests . For us to refuse the customary support and protection of such interests would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this Nation . Our largest foreign interests are in the British Empire , France , and Italy . Because we are constantly solicitous for those interests , I doubt if anyone would suppose that those countries feel we harbor toward them any militaristic or imperialistic design . As for smaller countries , we certainly do not want any of them . We are more anxious than they are to have their sovereignty respected . Our entire influence is in behalf of their independence . Cuba stands as a witness to our adherence to this principle . The position of this Government relative to the limitation of armaments , the results already secured , and the developments up to the present time are so well known to the Congress that they do not require any restatement . VETERANS The magnitude of our present system of veterans relief is without precedent , and the results have been far reaching . For years a service pension has been granted to the Grand Army and lately to the survivors of the Spanish American War . At the time we entered the World War however , Congress departed from the usual pension system followed by our Gove2rnment . Eleven years have elapsed since our laws were first enacted , initiating a system of compensation , rehabilitation , hospitalization , and insurance for the disabled of the World War and their dependents . The administration of all the laws concerning relief has been a difficult task , but it can safely be stated that these measures have omitted nothing in their desire to deal generously and humanely . We should continue to foster this system and provide all the facilities necessary for adequate care . It is the conception of our Government that the pension roll is an honor roll . It should include all those who are justly entitled to its benefits , but exclude all others . Annual expenditures for all forms of veterans relief now approximate 765 , 000 , 000 , and are increasing from year to year . It is doubtful if the peak of expenditures will be reached even under present legislation for sonic time yet to come . Further amendments to the existing law will be suggested by the American Legion , the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States , the Disabled American Veterans of the World War , and other like organizations , and it may be necessary for administrative purposes , or in order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law , to make further changes . I am sure that such recommendations its may be submitted to the Congress will receive your careful consideration . But because of the vast expenditure now being made , each year , with every assurance that it will increase , and because of the great liberality of the existing law , the proposal of any additional legislation dealing with this subject should receive most searching scrutiny from the Congress . You are familiar with the suggestion that the various public agencies now dealing with matters of veterans relief be consolidated in one Government department . Some advantages to this plan seem apparent , especially in the simplification of administration find in the opportunity of bringing about a greater uniformity in the application of veterans relief . I recommend that a survey be made by the proper committees of Congress dealing with this subject , in order to determine whether legislation to secure this consolidation is desirable . AGRICULTURE The past year has been marked by notable though not uniform improvement in agriculture . The general purchasing power of farmproducts and the volume of production have advanced . This means not only further progress , in overcoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in 1920 21 , but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and a well grounded confidence in the future of agriculture . The livestock industry has attained the best balance for many years and is prospering conspicuously . Dairymen , beef producers , an poultrymen are receiving substantially larger returns than last year . Cotton , although lower in price than at this time last year , was produced in greater volume and the prospect for cotton incomes is favorable . But progress is never uniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry . Cash grains , hay , tobacco , and potatoes will bring somewhat smaller returns this year than last . Present indications are , however , that the gross farm income will be somewhat larger than in the crop year 1927 28 , when the total was 12 , 253 , 000 , 000 . The corresponding figure for 1926 27 was 12 , 127 , 000 , 000 , and in 1925 26 , 12 , 670 , 000 , 000 . Still better results would have been secured this year had there not been an undue increase in the production of certain crops . This is particularly true of potatoes , which have sold at an unremunerative price , or at a loss , as a direct result of overexpansion of acreage . The present status of agriculture , although greatly improved over that of a few years ago , bespeaks the need of further improvemen4 which calls for determined effort of farmers themselves , encouraged and assisted by wise public policy . The Government has been , and must continue to be , alive to the needs of agriculture . In the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture has been adopted than during any other period . The Department of Agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greater efficiency . The department is laying greater stress on the economic and business phases of agriculture . It is lending every possible assistance to cooperative marketing associations . Regulatory and research work have been segregated in order that each field may be served more effectively . I can not too strongly commend , in the field of fact finding , the research work of the Department of Agriculture and the State experiment stations . The department now receives annually 4 , 000 , 000 more for research than in 1921 . In addition , the funds paid to the States for experimentation purposes under the Purnell Act constitute an annual increase in Federal payments to State agricultural experiment stations of 2 , 400 , 000 over the amount appropriated in 1921 . The program of support for research may wisely be continued and expanded . Since 1921 we have appropriated nearly an additional 2 , 000 , 000 for extension work , and this sum is to be increased next year under authorization by the Capper Ketcham Act . THE SURPLUS PROBLEM While these developments in fundamental research , regulation , and dissemination of agricultural information are of distinct hell to agriculture , additional effort is needed . The surplus problem demands attention . As emphasized in my last message , the Government should assume no responsibility in normal times for crop surplus clearly due to overextended acreage . The Government should , however , provide reliable information as a guide to private effort and in this connection fundamental research on prospective supply and demand , as a guide to production and marketing , should be encouraged . Expenditure of public funds to bring in more new land should have most searching scrutiny , so long as our farmers face unsatisfactory prices for crops and livestock produced on land already under cultivation . Every proper effort should be made to put land to uses for which it is adapted . The reforestation of land best suited for timber production is progressing and should be encouraged , and to this end the forest taxation inquiry was instituted to afford a practical guide for public policy . Improvement bas been made in grazing regulation in the forest reserves , not only to protect the ranges , but to preserve the soil from erosion . Similar action is urgently needed to protect other public lands which are now overgrazed and rapidly eroding . Temporary expedients , though sometimes capable of appeasing the demands of the moment , can not permanently solve the surplus problem and might seriously aggravate it . Hence putting the Government directly into business , subsidies , and price fixing , and the alluring promises of political action as a substitute for private initiative , should be avoided . The Government should aid in promoting orderly marketing and in handling surpluses clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions . As a beginning there should be created a Federal farm board consisting of able and experienced men empowered to advise producers associations in establishing central agencies or stabilization corporations to handle surpluses , to seek wore economical means of merchandising , and to aid the producer in securing returns according to the a14 of his product . A revolving loan fund should be provided for the necessary financing until these agencies shall have developed means of financing their operations through regularly constituted credit institutions . Such a bill should carry authority for raising the money , by loans or otherwise , necessary to meet the expense , as the Treasury has no surplus . Agriculture has lagged behind industry in achieving that unity of effort which modern economic life demands . The cooperative movement , which is gradually building the needed organization , is in harmony with public interest and therefore merits public encouragement . THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATES Important phases of public policy related to agriculture lie within the sphere of the States . While successive reductions in Federal taxes have relieved most farmers of direct taxes to the National Government , State and local levies have become a serious burden . This problem needs immediate and thorough study with a view to correction at the earliest possible moment . It will have to be made largely by the States themselves . COMMERCE It is desirable that the Government continue its helpful attitude toward American business . The activities of the Department of Commerce have contributed largely to the present satisfactory position in our international trade , which has reached about 9 , 000 , 000 , 000 annually . There should be no slackening of effort in that direction . it is also important that the department s assistance to domestic commerce be continued . There is probably no way in which the Government can aid sound economic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our business men to reduce wastes in distribution . COMMERCIAL AERONAUTICS Continued progress in civil aviation is most gratifying . Demands for airplanes and motors have taxed both the industry and the licensing and inspection service of the Department of Commerce to their capacity . While the compulsory licensing provisions of the air commerce act apply only to equipment and personnel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce , a Federal license may be procured by anyone possessing the necessary qualifications . State legislation , local airport regulations , and insurance requirements make such a license practically indispensable . This results in uniformity of regulation and increased safety in operation , which are essential to aeronautical development . Over 17 , 000 young men and women have now applied for Federal air pilot s licenses or permits . More than 80 per cent of them applied during the past year . Our national airway system exceeds 14 , 000 miles in length and has 7 , 500 miles lighted for night operations . Provision has been made for lighting 4 , 000 miles more during the current fiscal year and equipping an equal mileage with radio facilities . Three quarters of our people are now served by these routes . With the rapid growth of air mail , express , and passenger service , this new transportation medium is daily becoming a more important factor in commerce . It is noteworthy that this development has taken place without governmental subsidies . Commercial passenger flights operating on schedule have reached 13 , 000 miles per day . During the next fortnight this Nation will entertain the nations of the world in a celebration of the twenty fifth anniversary of the first successful airplane flight . The credit for this epoch making achievement belongs to a citizen of our own country , Orville Wright . CUBAN PARCEL POST I desire to repeat my recommendation of an earlier message , that Congress enact the legislation necessary to make permanent the Parcel Post Convention with Cuba , both as a facility to American commerce and as a measure of equity to Cuba in the one class of goods which that country can send here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade . MAINBATTLESHIP MEMORIAL When I attended the Pan American Conference at Habana , the President of Cuba showed me a marble statue made from the original memorial that was overturned by a storm after it was erected on the Cuban shore to the memory of the men who perished in the destruction of the battleship Maine . As a testimony of friendship and appreciation of the Cuban Government and people lie most generously offered to present this to the . United States , and I assured him of my pleasure in accepting it . There is no location in the White House for placing so large and heavy a structure , and I therefore urge the Congress to provide by law for some locality where it can be set up . RAILROADS In previous annual messages I have suggested the enactment of laws to promote railroad consolidation with the view of increasing the efficiency of transportation and lessening its cost to the public . While , consolidations can and should be made under the present law until it is changed , vet the provisions of the act of 1920 have not been found fully adequate to meet the needs of other methods of consolidation . Amendments designed to remedy these defects have been considered at length by the respective committees of Congress and a bill was reported out late in the last session which I understand has the approval in principle of the Interstate Commerce Commission . It is to be hoped that this legislation may be enacted at an early date . Experience has shown that the interstate commerce law requires definition and clarification in several other respects , some of which have been pointed out by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its annual reports to the Congress . It will promote the public interest to have the Congress give early consideration to the recommendations there made . MERCHANT MARINE The cost of maintaining the United States Government merchant fleet has been steadily reduced . We have established American flag lines in foreign trade where they had never before existed as a means of promoting commerce and as a naval auxiliary . There have been sold to private American capital for operation within the past few years 14 of these lines , which , under the encouragement of the recent legislation passed by the Congress , give promise of continued successful operation . Additional legislation from time to time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private control . Through the cooperation of the Post Office Department and the Shipping Board long term contracts are being made with American steamship lines for carrying mail , which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 new vessels and the gradual reestablishment of the American merchant marine as a private enterprise . No action of the National Government has been so beneficial to our shipping . The cost is being absorbed to a considerable extent by the disposal of unprofitable lines operated by the Shipping Board , for which the new law has made a market . Meanwhile it should be our policy to maintain necessary strategic lines under the Government operation until they can be transferred to private capital . INTER AMERICAN HIGHWAY In my message last year I expressed the view that we should lend our encouragement for more good roads to all the principal points on this hemisphere South of the Rio Grande . My view has not changed . The Pan American Union has recently indorsed it . In some of the countries to the south a great deal of progress is being made in road building . In , Others engineering features are often exacting and financing difficult . As those countries enter upon programs for road building we should be ready to contribute from our abundant experience to make their task easier of accomplishment . I prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end . We already furnish military and naval advisors , and following this precedent we could draw competent men from these same sources and from the Department of Agriculture . We should provide our southern neighbors , if they request it , with such engineer advisors for the construction of roads and bridges . Private t1literests should look with favor upon all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open main lines of travel . Such assistance should be given especially to any project for a highway designed to connect all the countries on this hemisphere and thus facilitate , intercourse and closer relations among , them . AIR MAIL SERVICE The friendly relations and the extensive , commercial intercourse with the Western Hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by the establishment and extension of air mail routes . We shall soon have one from Key West , Fla . , over Cuba , Haiti , and Santo Domingo to San Juan , R . , where it will connect with another route to Trinidad . There will be another route from Key West to the Canal Zone , where connection will be made with a route across the northern coast of South America to Paramaribo . This will give us a circle around the Caribbean under our own control . . Additional connections will be made at Colon with a route running down the west coast of South America as far as Conception , Chile , and with the French air mail at Paramaribo running down the eastern coast of South America . The air service already spans our continent , with laterals running to Mexico and Canada , and covering a daily flight of over 28 , 000 miles , with an average cargo of 15 000 pounds . WATERWAYS Our river and harbor improvements are proceeding with vigor . In the past few years Ave have increased the appropriation for this regular work 28 , 000 , 000 , besides what . is to be expended on flood control . The total appropriation for this year was over 91 , 000 , 000 . The Ohio River is almost ready for opening work on the Missouri and other rivers is under way . In accordance with the Mississippi flood law Army engineers are making investigations and surveys on other streams throughout the country with a view to flood control , navigation , waterpower , and irrigation . Our bar re lines are being operated under generous appropriations , and negotiations are developing relative to the Lawrence waterway . To Secure the largest benefits from all these waterways joint rates must be established with the railroads , preferably by agreement , but otherwise as a result of congressional action . We have recently passed several river and harbor bills . The work ordered by the Congress not , yet completed , will cost about 243 , 000 , 000 , besides the hundreds of millions to be spent on the Mississippi flood way . Until we can see our way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be passed , as expenditures to put it into effect would be four or five years away . IRRIGATION OF ARID LANDS For many years the Federal Government has been committed to the wise policy of reclamation and irrigation . While it has met with some failures due to unwise selection of projects and lack of thorough soil surveys , so that they could not be placed on a sound business basis , on the whole the service has been of such incalculable benefit in so many States that no one would advocate its abandonment . The program to which we are already committed , providing for the construction of new projects authorized by Congress and the completion of old projects , will tax the resources of the reclamation fund over a period of years . The high cost of improving and equipping farms adds to the difficulty of securing settlers for vacant farms on federal projects . Readjustments authorized by the reclamation relief act of May 25 , 1926 , have given more favorable terms of repayment to settlers . These new financial arrangements and the general prosperity on irrigation projects have resulted in increased collections by the Department of the Interior of charges due the reclamation fund . Nevertheless , the demand for still smaller yearly payments on some projects continues . These conditions should have consideration in connection with any proposed new projects . COLORADO RIVER For several years the Congress has considered the erection of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control , irrigation , and domestic water purposes , all of which ma properly be considered as Government functions . There would be an incidental creation of water power which could be used for generating electricity . As private enterprise can very well fill this field , there is no need for the Government to go into it . It is unfortunate that the States interested in this water have been unable to agree among themselves . Nevertheless , any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the present and prospective rights of each of them . The Congress will have before it , the detailed report of a special board appointed to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this project . From the short summary which I have seen of it , 11 judge they consider the engineering problems can be met at somewhat increased cost over previous estimates . They prefer the Black Canyon site . On the economic features they are not so clear and appear to base their conclusions on many conditions which can not be established with certainty . So far as I can judge , however , from the summary , their conclusions appear sufficiently favorable , so that I feel warranted in recommending a measure which will protect the rights of the States , discharge the necessary Government functions , and leave the electrical field to private . enterprise . MUSCLE SHOALS The development of other methods of producing nitrates will probably render this plant less important for that purpose than formerly . But we have it , and I am told it still provides a practical method of making nitrates for national defense and farm fertilizers . By dividing the property into its two component parts of power and nitrate plants it would be possible to dispose of the power , reserving the right to any concern that wished to make nitrates to use any power that might be needed for that purpose . Such a disposition of the power plant can be made that will return in rental about 2 , 000 , 000 per year . If the Congress would giant the Secretary of War authority to lease the nitrate plant on such terms as would insure the largest production of nitrates , the entire property could begin tofunction . Such a division , I am aware , has never seemed to appeal to the Congress . I should also gladly approve a bill granting authority to lease the entire property for the production of nitrates . I wish to avoid building another , lam at public expense . Future operators should provide For that themselves . But if they were to be required to repay the cost of such dam with tile prevailing commercial rates for interest , this difficulty will be considerably lessened . Nor do I think this property should be made a vehicle for putting the United States Government indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power distribution and nitrate sales . CONSERVATION The practical application of economy to the resources of the country calls for conservation . This does not mean that every resource should not be developed to its full degree , but it means that none of them should be wasted . We have a conservation board working on our oil problem . This is of the utmost importance to the future well being of our people in this age of oil burning engines and tile general application of gasoline to transportation . The Secretary of the Interior should not be compelled to lease oil lands of the Osage Indians when the market is depressed and the future supply is in jeopardy . While the area of lands remaining in public ownership is small , compared with the vast area in private ownership , the natural resources of those in public ownership are of immense present and future value . This is particularly trite as to minerals and water power . The proper bureaus have been classifying these resources to the end that they may be conserved . Appropriate estimates are being submitted , in the Budget , for the further prosecution of this important work . IMMIGRATION The policy of restrictive immigration should be maintained . Authority should be granted the Secretary of Labor to give immediate preference to learned professions and experts essential to new industries . The reuniting of families should be expedited . Our immigration and naturalization laws might well be codified . WAGE EARNER In its economic life our country has rejected the long accepted law of a limitation of the wage fund , which led to pessimism and despair because it was the doctrine of perpetual poverty , and has substituted for it the American conception that the only limit to profits and wages is production , which is the doctrine of optimism and hope because it leads to prosperity . Here and there the councils of labor are still darkened by the theory that only by limiting individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increasing numbers , but in general , management and wage earner alike have become emancipated from this doom and have entered a new era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits , the end of which is not yet . The application of this theory accounts for our widening distribution of wealth . No discovery ever did more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people . Since 1922 increasing production has increased wages in general 12 . 9 per cent , while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34 . 9 per cent and 38 per cent . Even in the boot and shoe shops the increase is over 5 per cent and in woolen mills 8 . 4 per cent , although these industries have not prospered like others . As the rise in living costs in this period is negligible , these figures represent real wage increases . The cause of constructive economy requires that the Government should cooperate with private interests to eliminate the waste arising from industrial accidents . This item , with all that has been done to reduce it , still reaches enormous proportions with great suffering to the workman and great loss to the country . WOMEN AND CHILDREN The Federal Government should continue its solicitous care for the 8 , 500 , 000 women wage earners and its efforts in behalf of public health , which is reducing infant mortality and improving the 91odily and mental condition of our citizens . CIVIL SERVICE The most marked change made in the civil service of the Government in the past eight years relates to the increase in salaries . The Board of Actuaries on the retirement act shows by its report , that July 1 , 1921 the average salary of the 330 , 047 employees subject to the act was J1 , 307 , while on June 30 , 1927 , the average salary of the corresponding , 405 , 263 was 1 , 969 . This was an increase in six years of nearly 53 per cent . On top of this was the generous increase made at the last session of the Congress generally applicable to Federal employees and another bill increasing the pay in certain branches of the Postal Service beyond the large increase which was made three years ago . This raised the average level from 1 , 969 to 2 , 092 , making an increase in seven years of over 63 per cent . While it is well known that in the upper brackets the pay in the Federalservice is much smaller than in private employment , in the lower brackets , ranging well up over 3 , 000 , it is much higher . It is higher not only in actual money paid , but in privileges granted , a vacation of 30 actual working days , or 5 weeks each year , with additional time running in some departments as high as 30 days for sick leave and the generous provisions of the retirement act . No other body of public servants ever occupied such a fortunate position . EDUCATION Through the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior the Federal Government , acting in an informative and advisory capacity , has rendered valuable service . While this province be7crigspeculiarly to the States , yet the promotion of education and efficiency in educational methods is a general responsibility of the Federal Government . A survey of negro colleges and universities in the United States has just been completed l7y the Bureau of Education through funds provided by the institutions themselves and through private sources . The present status of negro higher education was determined and recommendations were made for its advancement . This was one of the numerous cooperative undertakings of the bureau . Following the invitation of the Association of Land Grant Colleges and Universities , he Bureau of Education now has under way the survey of agricultural colleges , authorized by Congress . The purpose of the survey is to ascertain the accomplishments , the status , and the future objectives of this type of educational training . It is now proposed to undertake a survey of secondary schools , which educators insist is timely and essential . PUBLIC BUILDINGS We , have laid out a public building program for the District of Columbia and the country at large runni110 into hundreds of millions of dollars . Three important structures and one annex are already , under way and one addition has been completed in the City of Washington . in the country sites have been acquired , many buildings are in course of construction , and some are already completed . Plans for all this work are being prepared in order that it may be carried forward as rapidly as possible . This is the greatest building program ever assumed by this Nation . It contemplates structures of utility and of beauty . When it reaches completion the people will be well served and the Federal city will be supplied with the most beautiful and stately public buildings which adorn any capital in the world . THE AMERICAN INDIAN The administration of Indian affairs has been receiving intensive study for several years . The Department of the Interior has been able to provide better supervision of health , education , and industrial advancement of this native race through additional funds provided by the Congress . The present cooperative arrangement existing between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Public Health Service should be extended . The Government s responsibility to the American Indian has been acknowledged by annual increases in appropria . ltions to fulfill its obligations to them and to hasten the time when Federal supervision of their affairs may be properly and safely terminated . The movement in Congress and in some of the State legislatures for extending responsibility in Indian affairs to States should be encouraged . A complete participation by the Indian in our economic life is the end to be desired . THE NEGRO For 65 years now our negro Population has been under the peculiar care and solicitude of the National Government . The progress which they have made in education and the professions , in wealth and in the arts of civilization , affords one of the most remarkable incidents in this period of world history . They have demonstrated their ability to partake of the advantages of our institutions and to benefit by a free and more and more independent existence . Whatever doubt there may have been of their capacity to assume , the status granted to them by the Constitution of this Union is being rapidly dissipated . Their cooperation in the life of the Nation is constantly enlarging . Exploiting the Negro problem for political ends is being abandoned and their protection is being increased by those States in which their percentage of population is largest . Every encouragement should be extended for t le development of the race . The colored people have been the victims of the crime of lynching , which has in late years somewhat decreased . Some parts of the South already have wholesome laws for its restraint and punishment . Their example might well be followed by other States , and by such immediate remedial legislation as the Federal Government can extend under the Constitution . PHILIPPINE ISLANDS Under the guidance of Governor General Stimson the economic and political conditions of the Philippine Islands have been raised to a standard never before surpassed . The cooperation between his administration and the people of the islands is complete and harmonious . It would be an advantage if relief from double taxation could be granted by the Congress to our citizens doing business in the islands . PORTO RICO Due to the terrific storm that swept Porto Rico last September , the people of that island suffered large losses . The Red Cross and the War Department went to their rescue . The property loss is being , retrieved . Sugar , tobacco , citrus fruit , and coffee , all suffered damage . The first three can largely look after themselves . The coffee growers will need some assistance , which should be extended strictly on a business basis , and only after most careful investigation . The people of Porto Rico are not asking for charity . DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE It is desirable that all the legal activities of the Government be consolidated under the supervision of the Attorney General . In1870 it was felt necessary to create the Department of Justice for this purpose . During the intervening period , either through legislation creating law officers or departmental action , additional legal positions not under the supervision of the Attorney General have been provided until there are now over 900 . Such a condition is as harmful to the interest of the Government now as it was in 1870 , and should be corrected by appropriate legislation . SPECIAL GOVERNMENT COUNSEL In order to prosecute the oil cases , I suggested and the Congress enacted a law providing for the appointment of two special counsel . They have pursued their work with signal ability , recovering all the leased lands besides nearly 30 , 000 , 000 in money , and nearly 17 , 000 , 000 in other property . They find themselves hampered by a statute , which the Attorney General construes as applying to them , prohibiting their appearing for private clients before any department . For this reason , one has been compelled to resign . No good result is secured by the application of this rule to these counsel , and as Roberts has consented to take reappointment if the rule is abrogated I recommend the passage of an amendment to the law creating their office exempting them from the general rule against taking other cases involving the Government . PROHIBITION The country has duly adopted the eighteenth amendment . Those who object to it have the right to advocate its modification or repeal . Meantime it is binding upon the National and State Governments and all our inhabitants . The Federal enforcement bureau is making every effort to prevent violations , especially through smuggling , manufacture , and transportation , and to prosecute generally all violations for which it can secure evidence . It is bound to continue this policy . Under the terms of the Constitution , however , the obligation is equally on the States to exercise the power which they have through the executive , legislative . judicial , and police branches of their governments in behalf of enforcement . The Federal Government is doing and will continue to do all it can in this direction and is entitled to7the active cooperation of the States . CONCLUSION The country is in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and of peace more permanent than it has ever before experienced . But , having reached this position , we should not fail to comprehend that it can easily be lost . It needs more effort for its support than the less exalted places of the world . We shall not be permitted to take our case , but shall continue to be required to spend our days in unremitting toil . The actions of the Government must command the confidence of the country . Without this , our prosperity would be lost . We must extend to other countries the largest measure of generosity , moderation , and patience . In addition to dealing justly , we can well afford to walk humbly . The end of government is to keep open the opportunity for a moreabundant life . Peace and prosperity are not finalities they are only methods . It is too easy under their influence for a nation to become selfish and degenerate . This test has come to the United States . Our country has been provided with the resources with which it can enlarge its intellectual , moral , and spiritual life . The issue is in the hands of the people . Our faith in man and God is the justification for the belief in our continuing success .<speech_sep>To the Congress of the United States The present state of the Union , upon which it is customary for the President to report to the Congress under the provisions of the Constitution , is such that it may be regarded with encouragement and satisfaction by every American . Our country is almost unique in its ability to discharge fully and promptly all its obligations at home and abroad , and provide for all its inhabitants an increase in material resources , in intellectual vigor and in moral power . The Nation holds a position unsurpassed in all former human experience . This does not mean that we do not have any problems . It is elementary that the increasing breadth of our experience necessarily increases the problems of our national life . But it does mean that if all will but apply ourselves industriously and honestly , we have ample powers with which to meet our problems and provide for I heir speedy solution . I do not profess that we can secure an era of perfection in human existence , but we can provide an era of peace and prosperity , attended with freedom and justice and made more and more satisfying by the ministrations of the charities and humanities of life . Our domestic problems are for the most part economic . We have our enormous debt to pay , and we are paying it . We have the high cost of government to diminish , and we are diminishing it . We have a heavy burden of taxation to reduce , and we are reducing it . But while remarkable progress has been made in these directions , the work is yet far from accomplished . We still owe over 21 , 000 , 000 , 000 , the cost of the National Government is still about 3 , 500 , 000 , 000 , and the national taxes still amount to about 27 for each one of our inhabitants . There yet exists this enormous field for the application of economy . In my opinion the Government can do more to remedy the economic ills of the people by a system of rigid economy in public expenditure than can be accomplished through any other action . The costs of our national and local governments combined now stand at a sum close to 100 for each inhabitant of the land . A little less than one third of this is represented by national expenditure , and a little more than two thirds by local expenditure . It is an ominous fact that only the National Government is reducing its debt . Others are increasing theirs at about 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 each year . The depression that overtook business , the disaster experienced in agriculture , the lack of employment and the terrific shrinkage in all values which our country experienced in a most acute form in 1920 , resulted in no small measure from the prohibitive taxes which were then levied on all productive effort . The establishment of a system of drastic economy in public expenditure , which has enabled us to pay off about one fifth of the national debt since 1919 , and almost cut in two the national tax burden since 1921 , has been one of the main causes in reestablishing a prosperity which has come to include within its benefits almost every one of our inhabitants . Economy reaches everywhere . It carries a blessing to everybody . The fallacy of the claim that the costs of government are borne by the rich and those who make a direct contribution to the National Treasury can not be too often exposed . No system has been devised , I do not think any system could be devised , under which any person living in this country could escape being affected by the cost of our government . It has a direct effect both upon the rate and the purchasing power of wages . It is felt in the price of those prime necessities of existence , food , clothing , fuel and shelter . It would appear to be elementary that the more the Government expends the more it must require every producer to contribute out of his production to the Public Treasury , and the less he will have for his own benefit . The continuing costs of public administration can be met in only one way by the work of the people . The higher they become , the more the people must work for the Government . The less they are , the more the people can work for themselves . The present estimated margin between public receipts and expenditures for this fiscal year is very small . Perhaps the most important work that this session of the Congress can do is to continue a policy of economy and further reduce the cost of government , in order that we may have a reduction of taxes for the next fiscal year . Nothing is more likely to produce that public confidence which is the forerunner and the mainstay of prosperity , encourage and enlarge business opportunity with ample opportunity for employment at good wages , provide a larger market for agricultural products , and put our country in a stronger position to be able to meet the world competition in trade , than a continuing policy of economy . Of course necessary costs must be met , proper functions of the Government performed , and constant investments for capital account and reproductive effort must be carried on by our various departments . But the people must know that their Government is placing upon them no unnecessary burden . TAXES Everyone desires a reduction of taxes , and there is a great preponderance of sentiment in favor of taxation reform . When I approved the present tax law , I stated publicly that I did so in spite of certain provisions which I believed unwise and harmful . One of the most glaring of these was the making public of the amounts assessed against different income tax payers . Although that damage has now been done , I believe its continuation to be detrimental To the public welfare and bound to decrease public revenues , so that it ought to be repealed . Anybody can reduce taxes , but it is not so easy to stand in the gap and resist the passage of increasing appropriation bills which would make tax reduction impossible . It will be very easy to measure the strength of the attachment to reduced taxation by the power with which increased appropriations are resisted . If at the close of the present session the Congress has kept within the budget which I propose to present , it will then be possible to have a moderate amount of tax reduction and all the tax reform that the Congress may wish for during the next fiscal year . The country is now feeling the direct stimulus which came from the passage of the last revenue bill , and under the assurance of a reasonable system of taxation there is every prospect of an era of prosperity of unprecedented proportions . But it would be idle to expect any such results unless business can continue free from excess profits taxation and be accorded a system of surtaxes at rates which have for their object not the punishment of success or the discouragement of business , but the production of the greatest amount of revenue from large incomes . I am convinced that the larger incomes of the country would actually yield more revenue to the Government if the basis of taxation were scientifically revised downward . Moreover the effect of the present method of this taxation is to increase the cost of interest . on productive enterprise and to increase the burden of rent . It is altogether likely that such reduction would so encourage and stimulate investment that it would firmly establish our country in the economic leadership of the world . WATERWAYS Meantime our internal development should go on . Provision should be made for flood control of such rivers as the Mississippi and the Colorado , and for the opening up of our inland waterways to commerce . Consideration is due to the project of better navigation from the Great Lakes to the Gulf . Every effort is being made to promote an agreement with Canada to build the , Lawrence waterway . There are pending before the Congress bills for further development of the Mississippi Basin , for the taking over of the Cape Cod Canal in accordance with a moral obligation which seems to have been incurred during the war , and for the improvement of harbors on both the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts . While this last should be divested of some of its projects and we must proceed slowly , these bills in general have my approval . Such works are productive of wealth and in the long run tend to a reduction of the tax burden . RECLAMATION Our country has a well defined policy of reclamation established under statutory authority . This policy should be continued and made a self sustaining activity administered in a manner that will meet local requirements and bring our and lands into a profitable state of cultivation as fast as there is a market for their products . Legislation is pending based on the report of the Fact Finding Commission for the proper relief of those needing extension of time in which to meet their payments on irrigated land , and for additional amendments and reforms of our reclamation laws , which are all exceedingly important and should be enacted at once . No more important development has taken place in the last year than the beginning of a restoration of agriculture to a prosperous condition . We must permit no division of classes in this country , with one occupation striving to secure advantage over another . Each must proceed under open opportunities and with a fair prospect of economic equality . The Government can not successfully insure prosperity or fix prices by legislative fiat . Every business has its risk and its times of depression . It is well known that in the long run there will be a more even prosperity and a more satisfactory range of prices under the natural working out of economic laws than when the Government undertakes the artificial support of markets and industries . Still we can so order our affairs , so protect our own people from foreign competition , so arrange our national finances , so administer our monetary system , so provide for the extension of credits , so improve methods of distribution , as to provide a better working machinery for the transaction of the business of the Nation with the least possible friction and loss . The Government has been constantly increasing its efforts in these directions for the relief and permanent establishment of agriculture on a sound and equal basis with other business . It is estimated that the value of the crops for this harvest year may reach 13 , 000 , 000 , 000 , which is an increase of over 3 , 000 , 000 , 000 in three years . It compares with 7 , 100 , 000 , 000 in 1913 , arid if we make deduction from the figures of 1924 for the comparatively decreased value of the dollar , the yield this year still exceeds 1913 in purchasing power by over 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , and in this interval there has been no increase in the number of farmers . Mostly by his own effort the farmer has decreased the cost of production . A marked increase in the price of his products and some decrease in the price of his supplies has brought him about to a parity with the rest of the Nation . The crop area of this season is estimated at 370 , 000 , 000 acres , which is a decline of 3 , 000 , 000 acres from last year , and 6 , 000 , 000 acres from 1919 . This has been a normal and natural application of economic laws , which has placed agriculture on a foundation which is undeniably sound and beginning to be satisfactory . A decrease in the world supply of wheat has resulted in a very large increase in the price of that commodity . The position of all agricultural products indicates a better balanced supply , but we can not yet conclude that agriculture is recovered from the effects of the war period or that it is permanently on a prosperous basis . The cattle industry has not yet recovered and in some sections has been suffering from dry weather . Every effort must be made both by Government activity and by private agencies to restore and maintain agriculture to a complete normal relationship with other industries . It was on account of past depression , and in spite of present more encouraging conditions , that I have assembled an Agricultural Conference made up of those who are representative of this great industry in both its operating and economic sides . Everyone knows that the great need of the farmers is markets . The country is not suffering on the side of production . Almost the entire difficulty is on the side of distribution . This reaches back , of course , to unit costs and diversification , and many allied subjects . It is exceedingly intricate , for our domestic and foreign trade , transportation and banking , and in fact our entire economic system , are closely related to it . In time for action at this session , I hope to report to the Congress such legislative remedies as the conference may recommend . An appropriation should be made to defray their necessary expenses . MUSCLE SHOALS The production of nitrogen for plant food in peace and explosives in war is more and more important . It is one of the chief sustaining elements of life . It is estimated that soil exhaustion each year is represented by about 9 , 000 , 000 tons and replenishment by 5 , 450 , 000 tons . The deficit of 3 , 550 , 000 tons is reported to represent the impairment of 118 , 000 , 000 acres of farm lands each year . To meet these necessities the Government has been developing a water power project at Muscle Shoals to be equipped to produce nitrogen for explosives and fertilizer . It is my opinion that the support of agriculture is the chief problem to consider in connection with this property . It could by no means supply the present needs for nitrogen , but it would help and its development would encourage bringing other water powers into like use . Several offers have been made for the purchase of this property . Probably none of them represent final terms . Much costly experimentation is necessary to produce commercial nitrogen . For that reason it is a field better suited to private enterprise than to Government operation . I should favor a sale of this property , or long time lease , tinder rigid guaranties of commercial nitrogen production at reasonable prices for agricultural use . There would be a surplus of power for many years over any possibility of its application to a developing manufacture of nitrogen . It may be found advantageous to dispose of the right to surplus power separately with such reservations as will allow its gradual withdrawal and application to nitrogen manufacture . A subcommittee of the Committees on Agriculture should investigate this field and negotiate with prospective purchasers . If no advantageous offer be made , the development should continue and the plant should be dedicated primarily to the production of materials for the fertilization of the soil . RAILWAYS The railways during the past year have made still further progress in recuperation from the war , with large rains in efficiency and ability expeditiously to handle the traffic of the country . We have now passed through several periods of peak traffic without the car shortages which so frequently in the past have brought havoc to our agriculture and industries . The condition of many of our great freight terminals is still one of difficulty and results in imposing , large costs on the public for inward bound freight , and on the railways for outward bound freight . Owing to the growth of our large cities and the great increase in the volume of traffic , particularly in perishables , the problem is not only difficult of solution , but in some cases not wholly solvable by railway action alone . In my message last year I emphasized the necessity for further legislation with a view to expediting the consolidation of our rail ways into larger systems . The principle of Government control of rates and profits , now thoroughly imbedded in our governmental attitude toward natural monopolies such as the railways , at once eliminates the need of competition by small units as a method of rate adjustment . Competition must be preserved as a stimulus to service , but this will exist and can be increased tinder enlarged systems . Consequently the consolidation of the railways into larger units for the purpose of securing the substantial values to the public which will come from larger operation has been the logical conclusion of Congress in its previous enactments , and is also supported by the best opinion in the country . Such consolidation will assure not only a greater element of competition as to service , but it will afford economy in operation , greater stability in railway earnings , and more economical financing . It opens large possibilities of better equalization of rates between different classes of traffic so as to relieve undue burdens upon agricultural products and raw materials generally , which are now not possible without ruin to small units owing to the lack of diversity of traffic . It would also tend to equalize earnings in such fashion as to reduce the importance of section 15at which criticism , often misapplied , has been directed . A smaller number of units would offer less difficulties in labor adjustments and would contribute much to the , solution of terminal difficulties . The consolidations need to be carried out with due regard to public interest and to the rights and established life of various communities in our country . It does not seem to me necessary that we endeavor to anticipate any final plan or adhere to an artificial and unchangeable project which shall stipulate a fixed number of systems , but rather we ought to approach the problem with such a latitude of action that it can be worked out step by step in accordance with a comprehensive consideration of public interest . Whether the number of ultimate systems shall be more or less seems to me can only be determined by time and actual experience in the development of such consolidations . Those portions of the present law contemplating consolidations ore not , sufficiently effective in producing expeditious action and need amplification of the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission , particularly in affording a period for voluntary proposals to the commission and in supplying Government pressure to secure action after the expiration of such a period . There are other proposals before Congress for amending the transportation acts . One of these contemplates a revision of the method of valuation for rate making purposes to be followed by a renewed valuation of the railways . The valuations instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission 10 years ago have not yet been completed . They have cost the Government an enormous sum , and they have imposed great expenditure upon the railways , most of which has in effect come out of the public in increased rates . This work should not be abandoned or supplanted until its results are known and can be considered . Another matter before the Congress is legislation affecting the labor sections of the transportation act . Much criticism has been directed at the workings of this section and experience has shown that some useful amendment could be made to these provisions . It would be helpful if a plan could be adopted which , while retaining the practice of systematic collective bargaining with conciliation voluntary arbitration of labor differences , could also provide simplicity in relations and more direct local responsibility of employees and managers . But such legislation will not meet the requirements of the situation unless it recognizes the principle that t e public has a right to the uninterrupted service of transportation , and therefore a right to be heard when there is danger that the Nation may suffer great injury through the interruption of operations because of labor disputes . If these elements are not comprehended in proposed legislation , it would be better to gain further experience with the present organization for dealing with these questions before undertaking a change . SHIPPING BOARD The form of the organization of the Shipping Board was based originally on its functions as a semi judicial body in regulation of rates . During the war it was loaded with enormous administrative duties . It has been demonstrated time and again that this form of organization results in indecision , division of opinion and administrative functions , which make a wholly inadequate foundation for the conduct of a great business enterprise . The first principle in securing the objective set out by Congress in building up the American merchant marine upon the great trade routes and subsequently disposing of it into private operation can not proceed with effectiveness until the entire functions of the board are reorganized . The immediate requirement is to transfer into the Emergency Fleet , Corporation the whole responsibility of operation of the fleet and other property , leaving to the Shipping Board solely the duty of determining certain major policies which require deliberative action . The procedure under section 28 of the merchant marine act has created great difficulty and threatened friction during the past 12 months . Its attempted application developed not only great opposition from exporters , particularly as to burdens that may be imposed upon agricultural products , but also great anxiety in the different seaports as to the effect upon their relative rate structures . This trouble will certainly recur if action is attempted under this section . It is uncertain in some of its terms and of great difficulty in interpretation . It is my belief that action under this section should be suspended until the Congress can reconsider the entire question in the light of the experience that has been developed since its enactment . NATIONAL ELECTIONS Nothing is so fundamental to the integrity of a republican form of government as honesty in all that relates to the conduct of elections . I am of the opinion that the national laws governing the choice of members of the Congress should be extended to include appropriate representation of the respective parties at the ballot box ant equality of representation on the various registration boards , wherever they exist . THE JUDICIARY The docket of the Supreme Court is becoming congested . At the opening term last year it had 592 cases , while this year it had 687 cases . Justice long delayed is justice refused . Unless the court be given power by preliminary and summary consideration to determine the importance of cases , and by disposing of those which are not of public moment reserve its time for the more extended consideration of the remainder , the congestion of the docket is likely to increase . It is also desirable that Supreme Court should have power to improve and reform procedure in suits at law in the Federal courts through the adoption of appropriate rules . The Judiciary Committee of the Senate has reported favorably upon two bills providing for these reforms which should have the immediate favorable consideration of the Congress . I further recommend that provision be made for the appointment of a commission , to consist of two or three members of the Federal judiciary and as many members of the bar , to examine the present criminal code of procedure and recommend to the Congress measures which may reform and expedite court procedure in the administration and enforcement of our criminal laws . PRISON REFORM Pending before the Congress is a bill which has already passed one House providing for a reformatory to which could be committed first offenders and young men for the purpose of segregating them from contact with banned criminals and providing them with special training in order to reestablish in them the power to pursue a law abiding existence in the social and economic life of the Nation . This is a matter of so much importance as to warrant the early attention of the present session . Further provision should also be made , for a like reason , for a separate reformatory for women . NATIONAL POLICE BUREAU Representatives of the International Police Conference will bring to the attention of the Congress a proposal for the establishment of a national police bureau . Such action would provide a central point for gathering , compiling , and later distributing to local police authorities much information which would be helpful in the prevention and detection of crime . I believe this bureau is needed , and I recommend favorable consideration of this proposal . DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WELFARE The welfare work of the District of Columbia is administered by several different boards dealing with charities and various correctional efforts . It would be an improvement if this work were consolidated and placed under the direction of a single commission . FRENCH SPOLIATION CLAIMS During the last session of the Congress legislation was introduced looking to the payment of the remaining claims generally referred to as the French spoliation claims . The Congress has provided for the payment of many similar claims . Those that remain unpaid have been long pending . The beneficiaries thereunder have every reason to expect payment . These claims have been examined by the Court of Claims and their validity and amount determined . The United States ought to pay its debts . I recommend action by the Congress which will permit of the payment of these remaining claims . THE WAGE EARNER Two very important policies have been adopted by this country which , while extending their benefits also in other directions , have been of the utmost importance to the wage earners . One of these is the protective tariff , which enables our people to live according to a better standard and receive a better rate of compensation than any people , any time , anywhere on earth , ever enjoyed . This saves the American market for the products of the American workmen . The other is a policy of more recent origin and seeks to shield our wage earners from the disastrous competition of a great influx of foreign peoples . This has been done by the restrictive immigration law . This saves the American job for the American workmen . I should like to see the administrative features of this law rendered a little more humane for the purpose of permitting those already here a greater latitude in securing admission of members of their own families . But I believe this law in principle is necessary and sound , and destined to increase greatly the public welfare . We must maintain our own economic position , we must defend our own national integrity . It is gratifying to report that the progress of industry , the enormous increase in individual productivity through labor saving devices , and the high rate of wages have all combined to furnish our people in general with such an abundance not only of the necessaries but of the conveniences of life that we are by a natural evolution solving our problems of economic and social justice . THE NEGRO These developments have brought about a very remarkable improvement in the condition of the negro race . Gradually , but surely , with the almost universal sympathy of those among whom they live , the colored people are working out their own destiny . I firmly believe that it is better for all concerned that they should be cheerfully accorded their full constitutional rights , that they should be protected from all of those impositions to which , from their position , they naturally fall a prey , especially from the crime of lynching and that they should receive every encouragement to become full partakers in all the blessings of our common American citizenship . CIVIL SERVICE The merit system has long been recognized as the correct basis for employment in our , civil service . I believe that first second , and third class postmasters , and without covering in the present membership tile field force of prohibition enforcement , should be brought within the classified service by statute law . Otherwise the Executive order of one administration is changed by the Executive order of another administration , and little real progress is made . Whatever its defects , the merit system is certainly to be preferred to the spoils system . DEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATION One way to save public money would be to pass the pending bill for the reorganization of the various departments . This project has been pending for some time , and has had the most careful consideration of experts and the thorough study of a special congressional committee . This legislation is vital as a companion piece to the Budget law . Legal authority for a thorough reorganization of the Federal structure with some latitude of action to the Executive in the rearrangement of secondary functions would make for continuing economy in the shift of government activities which must follow every change in a developing country . Beyond this many of the independent agencies of the Government must be placed under responsible Cabinet officials , if we are to have safeguards of efficiency , economy , and probity . ARMY AND NAVY Little has developed in relation to our national defense which needs special attention . Progress is constantly being made in air navigation and requires encouragement and development . Army aviators have made a successful trip around the world , for which I recommend suitable recognition through provisions for promotion , compensation , and retirement . Under the direction of the Navy a new Zeppelin has been successfully brought from Europe across the Atlantic to our own country . Due to the efficient supervision of the Secretary of War the Army of the United States has been organized with a small body of Regulars and a moderate National Guard and Reserve . The defense test of September 12 demonstrated the efficiency of the operating plans . These methods and operations are well worthy of congressional support . Under the limitation of armaments treaty a large saving in outlay and a considerable decrease in maintenance of the Navy has been accomplished . We should maintain the policy of constantly working toward the full treaty strength of the Navy . Careful investigation is being made in this department of the relative importance of aircraft , surface and submarine vessels , in order that we may not fail to take advantage of all modern improvements for our national defense . A special commission also is investigating the problem of petroleum oil for the Navy , considering the best policy to insure the future supply of fuel oil and prevent the threatened drainage of naval oil reserves . Legislative action is required to carry on experiments in oil shale reduction , as large deposits of this type have been set aside for the use of the Navy . We have been constantly besought to engage in competitive armaments . Frequent reports will reach us of the magnitude of the military equipment of other , nations . We shall do well to be little impressed by such reports or such actions . Any nation undertaking to maintain a military establishment with aggressive and imperialistic designs will find itself severely handicapped in the economic development of the world . I believe thoroughly in the Army and Navy , in adequate defense and preparation . But I am opposed to any policy of competition in building and maintaining land or sea armaments . Our country has definitely relinquished the old standard of dealing with other countries by terror and force , and is definitely committed to the new standard of dealing with them through friendship and understanding . This new policy should be constantly kept in mind by the guiding forces of the Army and Navy , by the . Congress and by the country at large . I believe it holds a promise of great benefit to humanity . I shall resist any attempt to resort to the old methods and the old standards . I am especially solicitous that foreign nations should comprehend the candor and sincerity with which we have adopted this position . While we propose to maintain defensive and supplementary police forces by land and sea , and to train them through inspections and maneuvers upon appropriate occasions in order to maintain their efficiency , I wish every other nation to understand that this does not express any unfriendliness or convey any hostile intent . I want the armed forces of America to be considered by all peoples not as enemies but as friends as the contribution which is made by this country for the maintenance of the peace and security of the world . VETERANS With the authorization for general hospitalization of the veterans of all wars provided during the present year , the care and treatment of those who have served their country in time of peril and the attitude of the Government toward them is not now so much one of needed legislation as one of careful , generous and humane administration . It will ever be recognized that their welfare is of the first concern and always entitled to the most solicitous consideration oil the part of their fellow citizens . They are organized in various associations , of which the chief and most representative is the American Legion . Through its officers the Legion will present to the Congress numerous suggestions for legislation . They cover such a wide variety of subjects that it is impossible to discuss them within the scope of this message . With many of the proposals I join in hearty approval and commend them all to the sympathetic investigation and consideration of the Congress . FOREIGN RELATIONS At no period in the past 12 years have our foreign relations been in such a satisfactory condition as they are at the present time . Our actions in the recent months have greatly strengthened the American policy of permanent peace with independence . The attitude which our Government took and maintained toward an adjustment of European reparations , by pointing out that it wits not a political but a business problem , has demonstrated its wisdom by its actual results . We desire to see Europe restored that it may resume its productivity in the increase of industry and its support in the advance of civilization . We look with great gratification at the hopeful prospect of recuperation in Europe through the Dawes plan . Such assistance as can be given through the action of the public authorities and of our private citizens , through friendly counsel and cooperation , and through economic and financial support , not for any warlike effort but for reproductive enterprise , not to provide means for unsound government financing but to establish sound business administration should be unhesitatingly provided . Ultimately nations , like individuals , can not depend upon each other but must depend upon themselves . Each one must work out its own salvation . We have every desire to help . But with all our resources we are powerless to save unless our efforts meet with a constructive response . The situation in our own country and all over the world is one Chat can be improved only by bard work and self denial . It is necessary to reduce expenditures , increase savings and liquidate debts . It is in this direction that there lies the greatest hope of domestic tranquility and international peace . Our own country ought to finish the leading example in this effort . Our past adherence to this policy , our constant refusal to maintain a military establishment that could be thought to menace the security of others , our honorable dealings with other nations whether great or small , has left us in the almost constant enjoyment of peace . It is not necessary to stress the general desire of all the people of this country for the promotion of peace . It is the leading principle of all our foreign relations . We have on every occasion tried to cooperate to this end in all ways that were consistent with our proper independence and our traditional policies . It will be my constant effort to maintain these principles , and to reinforce them by all appropriate agreements and treaties . While we desire always to cooperate and to help , we are equally determined to be independent and free . Right and truth and justice and humanitarian efforts will have the moral support of this country all over the world . But we do not wish to become involved in the political controversies of others . Nor is the country disposed to become a member of the League of Nations or to assume the obligations imposed by its covenant . INTERNATIONAL COURT America has been one of the foremost nations in advocating tribunals for the settlement of international disputes of a justiciable character . Our representatives took a leading in those conferences which resulted in the establishment of e ague Tribunal , and later in providing for a Permanent Court of International Justice . I believe it would be for the advantage of this country and helpful to the stability of other nations for us to adhere to the protocol establishing , that court upon the conditions stated in the recommendation which is now before the Senate , and further that our country shall not be bound by advisory opinions which may be , rendered by the court upon questions which we have not voluntarily submitted for its judgment . This court would provide a practical and convenient tribunal before which we could go voluntarily , but to which we could not be summoned , for a determination of justiciable questions when they fail to be resolved by diplomatic negotiations . DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE Many times I have expressed my desire to see the work of the Washington Conference on Limitation of Armaments appropriately supplemented by further agreements for a further reduction M for the purpose of diminishing the menace and waste of the competition in preparing instruments of international war . It has been and is my expectation that we might hopefully approach other great powers for further conference on this subject as soon as the carrying out of the present reparation plan as the established and settled policy of Europe has created a favorable opportunity . But on account of proposals which have already been made by other governments for a European conference , it will be necessary to wait to see what the outcome of their actions may be . I should not wish to propose or have representatives attend a conference which would contemplate commitments opposed to the freedom of action we desire to maintain unimpaired with respect to our purely domestic policies . INTERNATIONAL LAW Our country should also support efforts which are being made toward the codification of international law . We can look more hopefully , in the first instance , for research and studies that are likely to be productive of results , to a cooperation among representatives of the bar and members of international law institutes and societies , than to a conference of those who are technically representative of their respective governments , although , when projects have been developed , they must go to the governments for their approval . These expert professional studies are going on in certain quarters and should have our constant encouragement and approval . OUTLAW OF WAR Much interest has of late been manifested in this country in the discussion of various proposals to outlaw aggressive war . I look with great sympathy upon the examination of this subject . It is in harmony with the traditional policy of our country , which is against aggressive war and for the maintenance of permanent and honorable peace . While , as I have said , we must safeguard our liberty to deal according to our own judgment with our domestic policies , we can not fail to view with sympathetic interest all progress to this desired end or carefully to study the measures that may be proposed to attain it . LATIN AMERICA While we are desirous of promoting peace in every quarter of the globe , we have a special interest in the peace of this hemisphere . It is our constant desire that all causes of dispute in this area may be tranquilly and satisfactorily adjusted . Along with our desire for peace is the earnest hope for the increased prosperity of our sister republics of Latin America , and our constant purpose to promote cooperation with them which may be mutually beneficial and always inspired by the most cordial friendships . FOREIGN DEBTS About 12 , 000 , 000 , 000 is due to our Government from abroad , mostly from European Governments . Great Britain , Finland , Hungary , Lithuania and Poland have negotiated settlements amounting close to 5 , 000 , 000 , 000 . This represents the funding of over 42 per cent of the debt since the creation of the special Foreign Debt Commission . As the life of this commission is about to expire , its term should be extended . I am opposed to the cancellation of these debts and believe it for the best welfare of the world that they should be liquidated and paid as fast as possible . I do not favor oppressive measures , but unless money that is borrowed is repaid credit can not be secured in time of necessity , and there exists besides a moral obligation which our country can not ignore and no other country can evade . Terms and conditions may have to conform to differences in the financial abilities of the countries concerned , but the principle that each country should meet its obligation admits of no differences and is of universal application . It is axiomatic that our country can not stand still . It would seem to be perfectly plain from recent events that it is determined to go forward . But it wants no pretenses , it wants no vagaries . It is determined to advance in an orderly , sound and common sense way . It does not propose to abandon the theory of the Declaration that the people have inalienable rights which no majority and no power of government can destroy . It does not propose to abandon the practice of the Constitution that provides for the protection of these rights . It believes that within these limitations , which are imposed not by the fiat of man but by the law of the Creator , self government is just and wise . It is convinced that it will be impossible for the people to provide their own government unless they continue to own their own property . These are the very foundations of America . On them has been erected a Government of freedom and equality , of justice and mercy , of education and charity . Living under it and supporting it the people have come into great possessions on the material and spiritual sides of life . I want to continue in this direction . I know that the Congress shares with me that desire . I want our institutions to be more and more expressive of these principles . I want the people of all the earth to see in the American flag the symbol of a Government which intends no oppression at home and no aggression abroad , which in the spirit of a common brotherhood provides assistance in time of distress .<speech_sep>Moderator , Members Of The Council It is my understanding that the purpose of this Council is to enlarge and improve the moral and spiritual life of the Nation . While I appreciate that its purpose is religious rather than political , I have felt a propriety in coming here because of my belief in the necessity for a growing reliance of the political success of our Government upon the religious convictions of our people . Everyone recognizes that our modern life has become more and more complex . It has become more and more interdependent . This is true in our economic life it is true in our political life . With the extension of knowledge and science , with the new powers that these have conferred , there are a multitude of ways and opportunities for committing crime , for doing wrongs which result in personal and property injury to others , and for perverting that which ought to minister to our well being to the service of evil ends which in former days did not exist . New occasions have been opened for the turning of the instrumentalities of government , which ought to be used for the public welfare , into the service of selfish and misguided interests . Temptations have been both multiplied and intensified . The perils both to the individual and to society have in numerous ways been increased manyfold . It is notorious that crime and violence always follow in the wake of war . It appears to be the rule that there is a dissolution of the old restraints , brought about by the reaction which follows from the severe discipline and nervous tension of an era of conflict . These may be , and probably are , a temporary state which will tend to disappear with the mere passage of time . But too many of our people have found oftentimes to their sorrow that the privileges of liberty instead of being easy to enjoy are in reality highly difficult responsibilities , requiring the utmost of effort for success . Nor can it be denied that on the part of some there is a tendency to disregard too many of the former standards of society and too much of the former influence of authority . Another characteristic of our present state of civilization , which has already been noted and commented upon , is the disposition of those who are less well equipped to receive the benefits of the modern state of society through bearing its burdens to attempt to resist all efforts to subject them to the necessary restraints and discipline , and to try to tear down and destroy the results which others have secured by generations of constant effort . What others have accumulated through industry and self denial they propose to seize and to dissipate and destroy through indolence and self indulgence , without compensation to its rightful owners . Lawlessness is altogether too prevalent , and a lack of respect for government and the conventions of enlightened society is altogether too apparent . It is because I do not know of any political method of adequately dealing with these difficulties that I have ventured to bring them to the attention of this Council . It is natural to attempt to shift the blame from ourselves to others when evil conditions arise . It is always easy to criticize the Government for failure to reform all morals , to prevent all crime , and generally to abolish all evil . I have great faith in the local and national governments of the United States , but much of this field is beyond their reach . They were not established to discharge this duty they are utterly unable to accomplish it . The chief function of organized government is to maintain order , provide security for persons and property , and set up the instrumentalities for the administration of justice . This means the making , interpretation , and the execution of the law through the legislature , the judiciary , the executive , and all the various machinery of administration which these imply . But it ought always to be remembered that our institutions have undertaken to recognize that the human mind is and must be free . This is one of the reasons why it is neither practical nor justifiable to impose upon the Government the responsibility for the ultimate provision of the instrumentalities which minister to the spiritual life . It is true that the Government can aid , and is aiding , in the solution of some of the problems to which I have already referred . Without doubt the law acts as a deterrent to wrong doing and will usually go a long way in the repression of crime . But this reaches its highest application only when there is a very healthy and determined public sentiment in favor of the observance of the law . The utmost ingenuity on the part of the police powers will be substantially all wasted , in an effort to enforce the law , if there does not exist a strong and vigorous determination on the part of the people to observe the law . Such a determination can not be produced by the Government . My own opinion is that it is furnished by religion . Another contribution of great benefit , which is carried on so successfully by the local public authorities , is that of education . It is well known that ignorance and vice and crime all flourish together . Our local schools which are sanctioned by the States and cherished by the National Government are institutions of enormous value not only in providing earning for our youth but in removing the prejudices which naturally would exist among various racial groups and bringing the rising generation of our people to a common understanding . A more thorough comprehension of our political and social institutions has rarely failed to produce a more loyal citizen . With few exceptions those who come to us as enemies of society are so because they have always found society enemies to them . Education in the elements and fundamentals of the American principles of human relationship has seldom failed to secure their allegiance . But the mere sharpening of the wits , the bare training of the intellect , the naked acquisition of science , while they would greatly increase the power for good , likewise increase the power for evil . An intellectual growth will only add to our confusion unless it is accompanied by a moral growth . I do not know of any source of more power other than that which comes from religion . But there is another and more basic reason why the Government can not supply the source and motive for the complete reformation of society . In the progress of the human race religious beliefs were developed before the formation of governments . It is my understanding that government rests on religion . While in our own country we have wisely separated the church and the state in order to emancipate faith from all political interference , nevertheless the forms and theories of our Government were laid in accordance with the prevailing religious convictions of the people . The great revival of the middle of the eighteenth century had a marked influence upon our Revolutionary period . The claim to the right to freedom , the claim to the right to equality , with the resultant right to self government the rule of the people have no foundation other than the common brotherhood of man derived from the common fatherhood of God . The righteous authority of the law depends for its sanction upon its harmony with the righteous authority of the Almighty . If this faith is set aside , the foundations of our institutions fail , the citizen is deposed from the high estate which he holds as amenable to a universal conscience , society reverts to a system of class and caste , and the Government instead of being imposed by reason from within is imposed by force from without . Freedom and democracy would give way to despotism and slavery . I do not know of any adequate support for our form of government except that which comes from religion . Our history has been marked by the contributions which have been made by clergymen to the cause of education and government . I need only to remind you that the Thomas Shepherd was the leading influence in the establishment of the first college in the United States , chartered in Massachusetts in 1636 . Two years later at Hartford the Thomas Hooker was declaring the fundamental principles upon which the American Republic was to rest , which was supplemented early in the next century at Ipswich by the writings and sermons of the John Wise . It is my understanding that these eminent divines were preaching good Congregational doctrine , though of course many other denominations have just as vigorously supported the same principles . These contributions were not made in any narrow or lay sense , but resulted from the broad general teachings of the necessity for an enlightened and consecrated people , and from the conclusions drawn from their theology as to the relations of men to each other and to their God . The teaching of religion necessarily taught education and government . It is on this theory that our institutions of government rest . We do not look upon the authority of the state as something imposed by a selected few upon the masses of the people through the special dispensation of divine right or by the force of military power , but we rather recognize the universal divine right including all the people to govern themselves in accordance with the dictates of a common conscience . If the people are the government it can not rise above them it can not furnish them with something they do not have it will be what they are . This is true representation . The government will be able to get out of the people only such virtue as religion has placed there . If society resists wrongdoing by punishment , as it must do unless it is willing to approve it through failure to resist it , for there is no middle ground , it may protect itself as it is justified in doing by restraining a criminal , but that in and of itself does not reform him . It is only a treatment of a symptom . It does not eradicate the disease . It does not make the community virtuous . No amount of restraint , no amount of law can do that . If our political and social standards are the result of an enlightened conscience , then their perfection depends upon securing a more enlightened conscience . Thomas Shepherd was not a great moral leader because he believed in promoting education . He believed in promoting education because he was a great moral leader . Thomas Hooker and John Wise were not great spiritual lights because they declared the principles of sound government . They declared the principles of sound government because they were great spiritual lights . It is necessary to do something more than to have government treat symptoms . If we are to preserve what we already have and provide for further reformation , we must become a nation of partakers of the spirit of Shepherd and Hooker and Wise , or , as the clergy tell us , we must become partakers of the spirit of the Great Master . This way is outside of the government . It is the realm of religion . It is this absolute necessity for support of the Government outside itself , through religion , that I wish to impress upon this assembly . Without that support political effort would be practically fruitless . It is not in any denominational or any narrow and technical sense that I refer to religion . I mean to include all that can be brought within that broad general definition . While I regard the clergy as the greatest power for religious teaching that we have , I do not refer to them alone . I am conscious that the example of devoted men and women , the result of the inevitable social relations , and above all the influence of piety in the home , are all forces of enormous significance . While certain formalities of the past may have lost the hold they once had , I do not see any diminution in the steadfastness of the religious convictions of the people . If these were broken down , society might go on for a time under its own momentum , but it would be had for destruction . We do not possess any other enlightening force . We do not have any other hope for the reform and perfection of society . There is no other method by which we can have life and have it more abundantly . While I have pointed out some of the difficulties and perils with which we are threatened at the present time , and while I believe we may well heed them and be warned by them , it is by no means my desire to sound any note of discouragement . The very fact that amid all the complexities and distractions of our present life we are still maintaining unimpaired the foundations of our institutions , constantly increasing the rectitude with which the great business affairs of our country are conducted , all the while improving our educational facilities , answering more and more generously to the calls of public and private charity , continually enlarging the field of art , giving more and more attention to the humanities , and becoming more and more responsive to spiritual things , appears to more to be incontrovertible evidence that though it may be practiced in a somewhat different manner than formerly the deep and abiding faith of our people in religion has not diminished but has increased . I have tried to indicate what I think the country needs in the way of help under present conditions . It needs more religion . If there are any general failures in the enforcement of the law , it is because there have first been general failures in the disposition to observe the law . I can conceive of no adequate remedy for the evils which beset society except through the influences of religion . There is no form of education which will not fail , there is no form of government which will not fail , there is no form of reward which will not fail . Redemption must come through sacrifice , and sacrifice is the essence of religion . It will be of untold benefit if there is a broader comprehension of this principle by the public and a continued preaching of this crusade by the clergy . It is only through these avenues , by a constant renewal and extension of our faith , that we can expect to enlarge and improve the moral and spiritual life of the Nation . Without that faith all that we have of an enlightened civilization can not endure .<speech_sep>Members of the Congress It is gratifying to report that for the fourth consecutive year the state of the Union in general is good . We are at peace . The country as a whole has had a prosperity never exceeded . Wages are at their highest range , employment is plentiful . Some parts of agriculture and industry have lagged some localities have suffered from storm and flood . But such losses have been absorbed without serious detriment to our great economic structure . Stocks of goods are moderate and a wholesome caution is prevalent . Rates of interest for industry , agriculture , and government have been reduced . Savers and investors are providing capital for new construction in industry and public works . The purchasing power of agriculture has increased . If the people maintain that confidence which they are entitled to have in themselves , in each other , and in America , a comfortable prosperity will continue . CONSTRUCTIVE ECONOMY Without constructive economy in Government expenditures we should not now be enjoying these results or these prospects . Because we are not now physically at war , some people are disposed to forget that our war debt still remains . The Nation must make financial sacrifices , accompanied by a stern self denial in public expenditures , until we have conquered the disabilities of our public finance . While our obligation to veterans and dependents is large and continuing , the heavier burden of the national debt is being steadily eliminated . At the end of this fiscal year it will be reduced from about 26 , 600 , 000 , 000 to about 17 , 975 , 000 , 000 . Annual interest , including war savings , will have been reduced from 1 , 055 , 000 , 000 to 670 , 0001 , 000 . The sacrifices of the people , the economy of the Government , are showing remarkable results . They should be continued for the purpose of relieving the Nation of the burden of interest and debt and releasing revenue for internal improvements and national development . Not only the amount , but the rate , of Government interest has been reduced . Callable bonds have been refunded and paid , so that during this year the average rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fell below 4 per cent . Keeping the credit of the Nation high is a tremendously profitable operation . TAX REDUCTION The immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt is tax reduction . The annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 is 212 , 000 , 000 . Without this no bill to relieve the taxpayers would be worth proposing . The three measures already enacted leave our Government revenues where they are not oppressive . Exemptions , have been increased until 115 , 000 , 000 people make but 2 , 500 , 000 individual taxable returns , so that further reduction should be mainly for the purpose of removing inequalities . The Secretary of the Treasury has recommended a measure which would give us a much better balanced system of taxation and without oppression produce sufficient revenue . It has my complete support . Unforeseen contingencies requiring money are always arising . Our probable surplus for June 30 , 1929 , is small . A slight depression in business would greatly reduce our revenue because of our present method of taxation . The people ought to take no selfish attitude of pressing for removing moderate and fair taxes which might produce a deficit . We must keep our budget balanced for each year . That is the corner stone of our national credit , the trifling price we pay to command the lowest rate of interest of any great power in the world . Any surplus can be applied to debt reduction , and debt reduction is tax reduction . Under the present circumstances it would be far better to leave the rates as they are than to enact a bill carrying the peril of a deficit . This is not a problem to be approached in a narrow or partisan spirit . All of those who participate in finding a reasonable solution will be entitled to participate in any credit that accrues from it without regard to party . The Congress has already demonstrated that tax legislation can be removed from purely political consideration into the realm of patriotic business principles . Any bill for tax reduction should be written by those who are responsible for raising , managing , and expending the finances of the Government . If special interests , too often selfish , always uninformed of the national needs as a whole , with hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries as engines of propaganda , are permitted to influence the withdrawal of their property from taxation , we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust , bad for business , bad for the country , probably resulting in a deficit , with disastrous financial Consequences . The Constitution has given the Members of the Congress sole authority to decide what tax measures shall be presented for approval . While welcoming information from any quarter , the Congress should continue to exercise its own judgment in a matter so vital and important to all the interests of the country as taxation . NATIONAL DEFENSE Being a nation relying not on force , but on fair dealing and good will , to maintain peace with others , we have provided a moderate military force in a form adapted solely to defense . It should be continued with a very generous supply of officers and with the present base of personnel , subject to fluctuations which may be temporarily desirable . The five year program for our air forces is in keeping with this same policy and commensurate with the notable contributions of America to the science of aeronautics . The provisions of the law lately enacted are being executed as fast as the practical difficulties of an orderly and stable development permit . While our Army is small , prudence requires that it should be kept in a high state of efficiency and provided with such supplies as would permit of its immediate expansion . The garrison ration has lately been increased . Recommendations for an appropriation of 6 , 166 , 000 for new housing made to the previous Congress failed to pass . While most of the Army is well housed , some of it which is quartered in wartime training camps is becoming poorly housed . In the past three years 12 , 533 , 000 have been appropriated for reconstruction and repairs , and an authorization has been approved of 22 , 301 , 000 for new housing , under which 8 , 070 , 000 has already been appropriated . A law has also been passed , complying with the request of the War Department , allocating funds received from the sale of buildings and land for housing purposes . The work , however , is not completed , so that other appropriations are being recommended . Our Navy is likewise a weapon of defense . We have a foreign commerce and ocean lines of trade unsurpassed by any other country . We have outlying territory in the two great oceans and long stretches of seacoast studded with the richest cities in the world . We are responsible for the protection of a large population and the greatest treasure ever bestowed upon any people . We are charged with an international duty of defending the Panama Canal . To meet these responsibilities we need a very substantial sea armament . It needs aircraft development , which is being provided under the five year program . It needs submarines as soon as the department decides upon the best type of construction . It needs airplane carriers and a material addition to its force of cruisers . We can plan for the future and begin a moderate building program . This country has put away the Old World policy of competitive armaments . It can never be relieved of the responsibility of adequate national defense . We have one treaty secured by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on our part for a limitation in naval armament . After most careful preparation , extending over months , we recently made every effort to secure a three power treaty to the same end . We were granted much cooperation by Japan , but we were unable to come to an agreement with Great Britain . While the results of the conference were of considerable value , they were mostly of a negative character . We know now that no agreement can be reached which will be inconsistent with a considerable building program on our part . We are ready and willing to continue the preparatory investigations on the general subject of limitation of armaments which have been started under the auspices of the League of Nations . We have a considerable cruiser tonnage , but a part of it is obsolete . Everyone knew that had a three power agreement been reached it would have left us with the necessity of continuing our building program . The failure to agree should not cause us to build either more or less than we otherwise should . Any future treaty of limitation will call on us for more ships . We should enter on no competition . We should refrain from no needful program . It should be made clear to all the world that lacking a definite agreement , the attitude of any other country is not to be permitted to alter our own policy . It should especially be demonstrated that propaganda will not cause us to change our course . Where there is no treaty limitation , the size of the Navy which America is to have will be solely for America to determine . No outside influence should enlarge it or diminish it . But it should be known to all that our military power holds no threat of aggrandizement . It is a guaranty of peace and security at home , and when it goes abroad it is an instrument for the protection of the legal rights of our citizens under international law , a refuge in time of disorder , and always the servant of world peace . Wherever our flag goes the rights of humanity increase . MERCHANT MARINE The United States Government fleet is transporting a large amount of freight and reducing its drain on the Treasury . The Shipping Board is constantly under pressure , to which it too often yields , to protect private interests , rather than serve the public welfare . More attention should be given to merchant ships as an auxiliary of the Navy . The possibility of including their masters and crews in the Naval Reserve , with some reasonable compensation , should be thoroughly explored as a method of encouraging private operation of shipping . Public operation is not a success . No investigation , of which I have caused several to be made , has failed to report that it could not succeed or to recommend speedy transfer to private ownership . Our exporters and importers are both indifferent about using American ships . It should be our policy to keep our present vessels in repair and dispose of them as rapidly as possible , rather than undertake any new construction . Their operation is a burden on the National Treasury , for which we are not receiving sufficient benefits . COMMERCIAL AVIATION A rapid growth is taking place in aeronautics . The Department of Commerce has charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of national airways . Almost 8 , 000 miles are already completed and about 4 , 000 miles more contemplated . Nearly 4 , 400 miles are now equipped and over 3 , 000 miles more will have lighting and emergency landing fields by next July . Air mail contracts are expected to cover 24 of these lines . Daily airway flying is nearly 15 , 000 miles and is expected to reach 25 , 000 miles early next year . Flights for other purposes exceed 22 , 000 miles each day . Over 900 airports , completed and uncompleted , have been laid out . The demand for aircraft has greatly increased . The policy already adopted by the Congress is producing the sound development of this coming industry . WESTERN HEMISPHERE AIR MAIL Private enterprise is showing much interest in opening up aviation service to Mexico and Central and South America . We are particularly solicitous to have the United States take a leading part in this development . It is understood that the governments of our sister countries would be willing to cooperate . Their physical features , the undeveloped state of their transportation , make an air service especially adaptable to their usage . The Post Office Department should be granted power to make liberal long term contracts for carrying our mail , and authority should be given to the Army and the Navy to detail aviators and planes to cooperate with private enterprise in establishing such mail service with the consent of the countries concerned . A committee of the Cabinet will later present a report on this subject . GOOD ROADS The importance and benefit of good roads is more and more coming to be appreciated . The National Government has been making liberal contributions to encourage their construction . The results and benefits have been very gratifying . National participation , however , should be confined to trunk line systems . The national tax on automobiles is now nearly sufficient to meet this outlay . This tax is very small , and on low priced cars is not more than 2 or 3 each year . While the advantage of having good roads is very large , the desire for improved highways is not limited to our own country . It should and does include all the Western Hemisphere . The principal points in Canada are already accessible . We ought to lend our encouragement in any way we can for more good roads to all the principal points in this hemisphere south of the Rio Grande . It has been our practice to supply these countries with military and naval advisers , when they have requested it , to assist them in national defense . The arts of peace are even more important to them and to us . Authority should be given by law to provide them at their request with engineering advisers for the construction of roads and bridges . In some of these countries already wonderful progress is being made in road building , but the engineering features are often very exacting and the financing difficult . Private interests should look with favor on all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open such main lines of travel . This general subject has been promoted by the Pan American Congress of Highways , which will convene again at Rio de Janeiro in July , 1928 . It is desirable that the Congress should provide for the appointment of delegates to represent the Government of the United States . CUBAN PARCEL POST We have a temporary parcel post convention with Cuba . The advantage of it is all on our side . During 1926 we shipped twelve times as many parcels , weighing twenty four times as much , as we received . This convention was made on the understanding that we would repeal an old law prohibiting the importation of cigars and cigarettes in quantities less than 3 , 000 enacted in 1866 to discourage smuggling , for which it has long been unnecessary . This law unjustly discriminates against an important industry of Cuba . Its repeal has been recommended by the Treasury and Post Office Departments . Unless this is done our merchants and railroads will find themselves deprived of this large parcel post business after the 1st of next March , the date of the expiration of the convention , which has been extended upon the specific understanding that it would expire at that time unless this legislation was enacted . We purchase large quantities of tobacco made in Cuba . It is not probable that our purchases would be any larger if this law was repealed , while it would be an advantage to many other industries in the United States . INSULAR POSSESSIONS Conditions in the Philippine Islands have been steadily improved . Contentment and good order prevail . Roads , irrigation works , harbor improvements , and public buildings are being constructed . Public education and sanitation have been advanced . The Government is in a sound financial condition . These immediate results were especially due to the administration of Gov . Gen . Leonard Wood . The six years of his governorship marked a distinct improvement in the islands and rank as one of the outstanding accomplishments of this distinguished man . His death is a loss to the Nation and the islands . Greater progress could be made , more efficiency could be put . into administration , if the Congress would undertake to expend , through its appropriating power , all or a part of the customs revenues which are now turned over to the Philippine treasury . The powers of the auditor of the islands also need revision and clarification . The government of the islands is about 98 per cent in the hands of the Filipinos . An extension of the policy of self government will be hastened by the demonstration on their part of their desire and their ability to carry out cordially and efficiently the provisions of the organic law enacted by the Congress for the government of the islands . It would be well for a committee of the Congress to visit the islands every two years . A fair degree of progress is being made in Porto Rico . Its agricultural products are increasing its treasury position , which has given much concern , shows improvement . I am advised by the governor that educational facilities are still lacking . Roads are being constructed , which he represents are the first requisite for building schoolhouses . The loyalty of the island to the United States is exceedingly gratifying . A memorial will be presented to you requesting authority to have the governor elected by the people of Porto Rico . This was never done in the case of our own Territories . It is admitted that education outside of the towns is as yet very deficient . Until it has progressed further the efficiency of the government and the happiness of the people may need the guiding hand of an appointed governor . As it is not contemplated that any change should be made immediately , the general subject may well have the thoughtful study of the Congress . PANAMA CANAL The number of commercial ships passing through the Panama Canal has increased from 3 , 967 in 1923 to 5 , 475 in 1927 . The total amount of tolls turned into the Treasury is over 166 , 000 , 000 , while all the operations of the canal have yielded a surplus of about 80 , 000 , 000 . In order to provide additional storage of water and give some control over the floods of the Chagres River , it is proposed to erect a dam to cost about 12 , 000 , 000 at Alhajuela . It will take some five years to complete this work . AGRICULTURE The past year has seen a marked improvement in the general condition of agriculture . Production is better balanced and without acute shortage or heavy surplus . Costs have been reduced and the average output of the worker increased . The level of farm prices has risen while others have fallen , so that the purchasing power of the farmer is approaching a normal figure . The individual farmer is entitled to great credit for the progress made since 1921 . He has adjusted his production and through cooperative organizations and other methods improved his marketing . He is using authenticated facts and employing sound methods which other industries are obliged to use to secure stability and prosperity . The old fashioned haphazard system is being abandoned , economics are being applied to ascertain the best adapted unit of land , diversification is being promoted , and scientific methods are being used in production , and business principles in marketing . Agriculture has not fully recovered from postwar depression . The fact is that economic progress never marches forward in a straight line . It goes in waves . One part goes ahead , while another halts and another recedes . Everybody wishes agriculture to prosper . Any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will have the earnest support of the Government . Their interests are not all identical . Legislation should assist as many producers in as many regions as possible . It should be the aim to assist the farmer to work out his own salvation socially and economically . No plan will be of any permanent value to him which does not leave him standing on his own foundation . In the past the Government has spent vast sums to bring land under cultivation . lt . is apparent that this has reached temporarily the saturation point . We have had a surplus of production and a poor market for land , which has only lately shown signs of improvement . The main problem which is presented for solution is one of dealing with a surplus of production . It is useless to propose a temporary expedient . What is needed is permanency and stability . Government price fixing is known to be unsound and bound to result in disaster . A Government subsidy would work out in the same way . It can not be sound for all of the people to hire some of the people to produce a crop which neither the producers nor the rest of the people want . Price fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus , instead of diminishing it . Putting the Government directly into business is merely a combination of subsidy and price fixing aggravated by political pressure . These expedients would lead logically to telling the farmer by law what and how much he should plant and where he should plant it , and what and how much he should sell and where he should sell it . The most effective means of dealing with surplus crops is to reduce the surplus acreage . While this can not be done by the individual farmer , it can be done through the organizations already in existence , through the information published by the Department of Agriculture , and especially through banks and others who supply credit refusing to finance an acreage manifestly too large . It is impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity for all those who engage in farming . If acreage becomes overextended , the Government can not assume responsibility for it . The Government can , however , assist cooperative associations and other organizations in orderly marketing and handling a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions , in order to save the producer from preventable loss . While it is probably impossible to secure this result at a single step , and much will have to be worked out by trial and rejection , a beginning could be made by setting up a Federal board or commission of able and experienced men in marketing , granting equal advantages under this board to the various agricultural commodities and sections of the country , giving encouragement to the cooperative movement in agriculture , and providing a revolving loan fund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing . Such legislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of the surplus problem . This is not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer , who is already fairly well financed , but to lend money temporarily to experimental marketing associations which will no doubt ultimately be financed by the regularly established banks , as were the temporary operations of the War Finance Corporation . Cooperative marketing especially would be provided with means of buying or building physical properties . The National Government has almost entirely relieved the farmer from income taxes by successive tax reductions , but State and local taxes have increased , putting on him a grievous burden . A policy of rigid economy should be applied to State and local expenditures . This is clearly within the legislative domain of the States . The Federal Government has also improved our banking structure and system of agricultural credits . The farmer will be greatly benefited by similar action in many States . The Department of Agriculture is undergoing changes in organization in order more completely to separate the research and regulatory divisions , that each may be better administered . More emphasis is being placed on the research program , not only by enlarging the appropriations for State experiment stations but by providing funds for expanding the research work of the department . It is in this direction that much future progress can be expected . THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF The present tariff rates supply the National Treasury with well over 600 , 000 , 000 of annual revenue . Yet , about 65 per cent of our imports come in duty free . Of the remaining 35 per cent of imports on which duties are laid about 23 per cent consists of luxuries and agricultural products , and the balance of about 12 per cent , amounting , to around 560 , 000 , 000 is made up of manufactures and merchandise . As no one is advocating any material reduction in the rates on agriculture or luxuries , it is only the comparatively small amount of about 560 , 000 , 000 of other imports that are really considered in any discussion of reducing tariff rates . While this amount , duty free , would be large enough seriously to depress many lines of business in our own country , it is of small importance when spread over the rest of the world . It is often stated that a reduction of tariff rates on industry would benefit agriculture . It would be interesting to know to what commodities it is thought this could be applied . Everything the farmer uses in farming is already on the free list . Nearly everything he sells is protected . It would seem to be obvious that it is better for tile country to have the farmer raise food to supply the domestic manufacturer than the foreign manufacturer . In one case our country would have only the farmer in the other it would have the farmer and the manufacturer . Assuming that Europe would have more money if it sold us larger amounts of merchandise , it is not certain it would consume more food , or , if it did , that its purchases would be made in this country . Undoubtedly it would resort to the cheapest market , which is by no means ours . The largest and best and most profitable market for the farmer in the world is our own domestic market . Any great increase in manufactured imports means the closing of our own plants . Nothing would be worse for agriculture . Probably no one expects a material reduction in the rates on manufactures while maintaining the rates on agriculture . A material reduction in either would be disastrous to tile farmer . It would mean a general shrinkage of values , a deflation of prices , a reduction of wages , a general depression carrying our people down to the low standard of living in our competing countries . It is obvious that this would not improve but destroy our market for imports , which is best served by maintaining our present high purchasing power under which in the past five years imports have increased 63 per cent . FARM LOAN SYSTEM It is exceedingly important that the Federal land and joint stock land banks should furnish the best possible service for agriculture . Certain joint stock banks have fallen into improper and unsound practices , resulting in the indictment of the officials of three of them . More money has been provided for examinations , and at the instance of the Treasury rules and regulations of the Federal Farm Board have been revised . Early last May three of its members resigned . Their places were filled with men connected with the War Finance Corporation . Eugene Meyer being designated as Farm Loan Commissioner . The new members have demonstrated their ability in the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operations of he War Finance Corporation . Three joint stock banks have gone into receivership . It is necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order to find a market for their bonds . A recent flotation was made at a record low rate of 4 per cent . Careful supervision is absolutely necessary to protect the investor and enable these banks to exercise their chief function in serving agriculture . MUSCLE SHOALS The last year has seen considerable changes in the problem of Muscle Shoals . Development of other methods show that nitrates can probably be produced at less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power . Extensive investigation made by the Department of War indicates that the nitrate plants on this project are of little value for national defense and can probably be disposed of within two years . The oxidation part of the plants , however , should be retained indefinitely . This leaves this project mostly concerned with power . It should , nevertheless , continue to be dedicated to agriculture . It is probable that this desire can be best served by disposing of the plant and applying the revenues received from it to research for methods of more economical production of concentrated fertilizer and to demonstrations and other methods of stimulating its use on the farm . But in disposing of the property preference should be given to proposals to use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizer manufacturing . FLOOD CONTROL For many years the Federal Government has been building a system of dikes along the Mississippi River for protection against high water . During the past season the lower States were overcome by a most disastrous flood . Many thousands of square miles were inundated a great many lives were lost , much livestock was drowned , and a very heavy destruction of property was inflicted upon the inhabitants . The American Red Cross at once went to the relief of the stricken communities . Appeals for contributions have brought in over 17 , 000 , 000 . The Federal Government has provided services , equipment , and supplies probably amounting to about 7 , 000 , 000 more . Between 5 , 000 , 000 and 10 , 000 , 000 in addition have been provided by local railroads , the States , and their political units . Credits have been arranged by the Farm Loan Board , and three emergency finance corporations with a total capital of 3 , 000 , 000 have insured additional resources to the extent of 12 , 000 , 000 . Through these means the 700 , 000 people in the flooded areas have been adequately supported . Provision has been made to care for those in need until after the 1st of January . The Engineering Corps of the Army has contracted to close all breaks in the dike system before the next season of high water . A most thorough and elaborate survey of the whole situation has been made and embodied in a report with recommendations for future flood control , which will be presented to the Congress . The carrying out of their plans will necessarily extend over a series of years . They will call for a raising and strengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency spillway s and improvements for the benefit of navigation . Under the present law the land adjacent to the dikes has paid one third of the cost of their construction . This has been a most extraordinary concession from the plan adopted in relation to irrigation , where the general rule has been that the land benefited should bear the entire expense . It is true , of course , that the troublesome waters do not originate on the land to be reclaimed , but it is also true that such waters have a right of way through that section of the country and the land there is charged with that easement . It is the land of this region that is to be benefited . To say that it is unable to bear any expense of reclamation is the same thing as saying that it is not worth reclaiming . Because of expenses incurred and charges already held against this land , it seems probable that some revision will have to be made concerning the proportion of cost which it should bear . But it is extremely important that it should pay enough so that those requesting improvements will be charged with some responsibility for their cost , and the neighborhood where works are constructed have a pecuniary interest in preventing waste and extravagance and securing a wise and economical expenditure of public funds . It is necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster . It has been so treated from its inception . Our whole people have provided with great generosity for its relief . Most of the departments of the Federal Government have been engaged in the same effort . The governments of the afflicted areas , both State and municipal , can not be given too high praise for the courageous and helpful way in which they have come to the rescue of the people . If the sources directly chargeable can not meet the demand , the National Government should not fail to provide generous relief . This , however , does not mean restoration . The Government is not an insurer of its citizens against the hazard of the elements . We shall always have flood and drought , heat and cold , earthquake and wind , lightning and tidal wave , which are all too constant in their afflictions . The Government does not undertake to reimburse its citizens for loss and damage incurred under such circumstances . It is chargeable , however , with the rebuilding of public works and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress . The people in the flooded area and their representatives have approached this problem in the most generous and broad minded way . They should be met with a like spirit on the part of the National government . This is all one country . The public needs of each part must be provided for by the public at large . No required relief should be refused . An adequate plan should be adopted to prevent a recurrence of this disaster in order that the people may restore to productivity and comfort their fields and their towns . Legislation by this Congress should be confined to our principal and most pressing problem , the lower Mississippi , considering tributaries only so far as they materially affect the main flood problem . A definite Federal program relating to our waterways was proposed when the last Congress authorized a comprehensive survey of all the important streams of the country in order to provide for their improvement , including flood control , navigation , power , and irrigation . Other legislation should wait pending a report on this survey . The recognized needs of the Mississippi should not be made a vehicle for carrying other projects . All proposals for development should stand on their own merits . Any other method would result in ill advised conclusions , great waste of money , and instead of promoting would delay the orderly and certain utilization of our water resources . Very recently several of the New England States have suffered somewhat similarly from heavy rainfall and high water . No reliable estimate of damage has yet been computed , but it is very large to private and public property . The Red Cross is generously undertaking what is needed for immediate relief , repair and reconstruction of houses , restocking of domestic animals , and food , clothing , and shelter . A considerable sum of money will be available through the regular channels in the Department of Agriculture for reconstruction of highways . It may be necessary to grant special aid for this purpose . Complete reports of what is required will undoubtedly be available early in the session . INLAND NAVIGATION The Congress in its last session authorized the general improvements necessary to provide the Mississippi waterway system with better transportation . Stabilization of the levels of the Great Lakes and their opening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be considered . Since the last session the Board of Engineers of the War Department has made a report on the proposal for a canal through the State of New York , and the Joint Board of Engineers , representing Canada and the United States , has finished a report on the Lawrence River . Both of these boards conclude that the Lawrence project is cheaper , affords a more expeditious method of placing western products in European markets , and will cost less to operate . The State Department has requested the Canadian Government to negotiate treaties necessary to provide for this improvement . It will also be necessary to secure an agreement with Canada to put in works necessary to prevent fluctuation in the levels of the Great Lakes . Legislation is desirable for the construction of a dam at Boulder Canyon on the Colorado River , primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation . A secondary result would be a considerable power development and a source of domestic water supply for southern California . Flood control is clearly a national problem , and water supply is a Government problem , but every other possibility should be exhausted before the Federal Government becomes engaged in the power business . The States which are interested ought to reach mutual agreement . This project is in reality their work . If they wish the Federal Government to undertake it , they should not hesitate to make the necessary concessions to each other . This subject is fully discussed in the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior . The Columbia River Basin project is being studied and will be one to be considered at some future time . The Inland Waterways Corporation is proving successful and especially beneficial to agriculture . A survey is being made to determine its future needs . It has never been contemplated that if inland rivers were opened to navigation it would then be necessary for the Federal Government to provide the navigation . Such a request is very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that their navigation is not profitable , that the commodities which they are to carry can be taken at a cheaper rate by some other method , in which case the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be expended for opening rivers to navigation would be not only wasted , but would entail further constant expenditures to carry the commodities of private persons for less than cost . The policy is well established that the Government should open public highways on land and on water , but for use of the public in their private capacity . It has put on some demonstration barge lines , but always with the expectation that if they prove profitable they would pass into private hands and if they do not prove profitable they will be withdrawn . The problems of transportation over inland waterways should be taken up by private enterprise , so that the public will have the advantage of competition in service . It is expected that some of our lines can be sold , some more demonstration work done , and that with the completion of the Ohio project a policy of private operation can be fully developed . PROHIBITION After more than two generations of constant debate , our country adopted a system of national prohibition under all the solemnities involved in an amendment to the Federal Constitution . In obedience to this mandate the Congress and the States , with one or two notable exceptions , have passed required laws for its administration and enforcement . This imposes upon the citizenship of the country , and especially on all public officers , not only the duty to enforce , but the obligation to observe the sanctions of this constitutional provision and its resulting laws . If this condition could be secured , all question concerning prohibition would cease . The Federal Government is making every effort to accomplish these results through careful organization , large appropriations , and administrative effort . Smuggling has been greatly cut down , the larger sources of supply for illegal sale have been checked , and by means of injunction and criminal prosecution the process of enforcement is being applied . The same vigilance on the part of local governments would render these efforts much more successful . The Federal authorities propose to discharge their obligation for enforcement to the full extent of their ability . THE NEGRO History does not anywhere record so much progress made in the same length of time as that which has been accomplished by the Negro race in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation . They have come up from slavery to be prominent in education , the professions , art , science , agriculture , banking , and commerce . It is estimated that 50 , 000 of them are on the Government pay rolls , drawing about 50 , 000 , 000 each year . They have been the recipients of presidential appointments and their professional ability has arisen to a sufficiently high plane so that they have been intrusted with the entire management and control of the great veterans hospital at Tuskegee , where their conduct has taken high rank . They have shown that they have been worthy of all the encouragement which they have received . Nevertheless , they are too often subjected to thoughtless and inconsiderate treatment , unworthy alike of the white or colored races . They have especially been made the target of the foul crime of lynching . For several years these acts of unlawful violence had been diminishing . In the last year they have shown an increase . Every principle of order and law and liberty is opposed to this crime . The Congress should enact any legislation it can under the Constitution to provide for its elimination . AMERICAN INDIAN The condition of the American Indian has much improved in recent years . Full citizenship was bestowed upon them on June 2 , 1924 , and appropriations for their care and advancement have been increased . Still there remains much to be done . Notable increases in appropriations for the several major functions performed by the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Indians have marked the last five years . In that time , successive annual increases in appropriations for their education total 1 , 804 , 325 for medical care , 578 , 000 and for industrial advancement , 205 , 000 or 2 , 582 , 325 more than would have been spent in the same period on the basis of appropriations for 1923 and the preceding years . The needs along health , educational , industrial and social lines however , are great , and the Budget estimates for 1929 include still further increases for Indian administration . To advance the time when the Indians may become self sustaining , it is my belief that the Federal Government should continue to improve the facilities for their care , and as rapidly as possible turn its responsibility over to the States . COAL Legislation authorizing a system of fuel administration and the appointment by the President of a Board of Mediation and Conciliation in case of actual or threatened interruption of production is needed . The miners themselves are now seeking information and action from the Government , which could readily be secured through such a board . It is believed that a thorough investigation and reconsideration of this proposed policy by the Congress will demonstrate that this recommendation is sound and should be adopted . PETROLEUM CONSERVATION The National Government is undertaking to join in the formation of a cooperative committee of lawyers , engineers , and public officers , to consider what legislation by the States or by the Congress can be adopted for the preservation and conservation of our supply of petroleum . This has come to be one of the main dependencies for transportation and power so necessary to our agricultural and industrial life . It is expected the report of this committee will be available for later congressional action . Meantime , the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior should make certain leases of land belonging to the Osage Indians , in accordance with the act of March 3 , 1921 , should be repealed . The authority to lease should be discretionary , in order that the property of the Indians way not be wasted and the public suffer a future lack of supply . ALIEN PROPERTY Under treaty the property held by the Alien Property Custodian was to be retained until suitable provision had been made for the satisfaction of American claims . While still protecting the American claimants , in order to afford every possible accommodation to the nationals of the countries whose property was held , the Congress has made liberal provision for the return of a larger part of the property . All trusts under 10 , 000 were returned in full , and partial returns were made on the others . The total returned was approximately 350 , 000 , 000 . There is still retained , however , about 250 , 000 , 000 . The Mixed Claims Commission has made such progress in the adjudication of claims that legislation can now be enacted providing for the return of the property , which should be done under conditions which will protect our Government and our claimants . Such a measure will be proposed , and I recommend its enactment . RAILROAD CONSOLIDATION In order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its cost to the shipper , railroad consolidation must be secured . Legislation is needed to simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreements and arrangements for consolidation , always under the control and with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission . Pending this , no adequate or permanent reorganization can be made of the freight rate structure . Meantime , both agriculture and industry are compelled to wait for needed relief . This is purely a business question , which should be stripped of all local and partisan bias and decided on broad principles and its merits in order to promote the public welfare . A large amount of new construction and equipment , which will furnish employment for labor and markets for commodities of both factory and farm , wait on the decision of this important question . Delay is holding back the progress of our country . Many of the same arguments are applicable to the consolidation of the Washington traction companies . VETERANS The care which this country has lavished on its veterans is known of all men . The yearly outlay for this purpose is about 750 , 000 , 000 , or about the cost of running the Federal Government , outside of the Post Office Department , before the World War . The Congress will have before it recommendations of the American Legion , the Veterans of Foreign Wars , and other like organizations , which should receive candid consideration . We should continue to foster our system of compensation and rehabilitation , and provide hospitals and insurance . The magnitude of the undertaking is already so large that all requests calling for further expenditure should have the most searching scrutiny . Our present system of pensions is already sufficiently liberal . It was increased by the last Congress for Civil and Spanish War veterans and widows and for some dependents . It has been suggested that the various governmental agencies now dealing with veterans relief be consolidated . This would bring many advantages . It is recommended that the proper committees of the Congress make a thorough survey of this subject , in order to determine if legislation to secure such consolidation is desirable . EDUCATION For many years it has been the policy of the Federal Government to encourage and foster the cause of education . Large sums of money are annually appropriated to carry on vocational training . Many millions go into agricultural schools . The general subject is under the immediate direction of a Commissioner of Education . While this subject is strictly a State and local function , it should continue to have the encouragement of the National Government . I am still of the opinion that much good could be accomplished through the establishment of a Department of Education and Relief , into which would be gathered all of these functions under one directing member of the Cabinet . DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Industrial relations have never been more peaceful . In recent months they have suffered from only one serious controversy . In all others difficulties have been adjusted , both management and labor wishing to settle controversies by friendly agreement rather than by compulsion . The welfare of women and children is being especially guarded by our Department of Labor . Its Children s Bureau is in cooperation with 26 State boards and 80 juvenile courts . Through its Bureau of Immigration it bas been found that medical examination abroad has saved prospective immigrants from much hardship . Some further legislation to provide for reuniting families when either the husband or the wife is in this country , and granting more freedom for the migration of the North American Indian tribes is desirable . The United States Employment Service has enabled about 2 , 000 , 000 men and women to gain paying positions in the last fiscal year . Particular attention has been given to assisting men past middle life and in providing field labor for harvesting agricultural crops . This has been made possible in part through the service of the Federal Board for Vocational Education , which is cooperating with the States in a program to increase the technical knowledge and skill of the wage earner . PUBLIC BUILDINGS Construction is under way in the country and ground has been broken for carrying out a public building program for Washington . We have reached a time when not only the conveniences but the architectural beauty of the public buildings of the Capital City should be given much attention . It will be necessary to purchase further land and provide the required continuing appropriations . HISTORICAL CELEBRATIONS Provision is being made to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of George Washington . Suggestion has been made for the construction of a memorial road leading from the Capital to Mount Vernon , which may well have the consideration of the Congress , and the commission intrusted with preparations for the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication of the complete writings of Washington and a series of writings by different authors relating to him . February 25 , 1929 . is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the capture of Fort Sackville , at Vincennes , in the State of Indiana . This eventually brought into the Union what was known as the Northwest Territory , embracing the region north of the Ohio River between the Alleghenies and the Mississippi River . This expedition was led by George Rogers Clark . His heroic character and the importance of his victory are too little known and understood . They gave us not only this Northwest Territory but by means of that the prospect of reaching the Pacific . The State of Indiana is proposing to dedicate the site of Fort Sackville as a national shrine . The Federal Government may well make some provision for the erection under its own management of a fitting memorial at that point . FOREIGN RELATIONS It is the policy of the United States to promote peace . We are a peaceful people and committed to the settling of disputes by amicable adjustment rather than by force . We have believed that peace can best be secured by a faithful observance on our part of the principles of international law , accompanied by patience and conciliation , and requiring of others a like treatment for ourselves . We have lately had some difference with Mexico relative to the injuries inflicted upon our nationals and their property within that country . A firm adherence to our rights and a scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of Mexico , both in accordance with the law of nations , coupled with patience and forbearance , it is hoped will resolve all our differences without interfering with the friendly relationship between the two Governments . We have been compelled to send naval and marine forces to China to protect the lives and property of our citizens . Fortunately their simple presence there has been sufficient to prevent any material loss of life . But there has been considerable loss of property . That unhappy country is torn by factions and revolutions which bid fair to last for an indefinite period . Meanwhile we are protecting our citizens and stand ready to cooperate with any government which may emerge in promoting the welfare of the people of China . They have always had our friendship , and they should especially merit our consideration in these days of their distraction and distress . We were confronted by similar condition on a small scale in Nicaragua . Our marine and naval forces protected our citizens and their property and prevented a heavy sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country by a reversion to a state of revolution . Henry Stimson , former Secretary of War , was sent there to cooperate with our diplomatic and military officers in effecting a settlement between the contending parties . This was done on the assurance that we would cooperate in restoring a state of peace where our rights would be protected by giving our assistance in the conduct of the next presidential election , which occurs in a few months . With this assurance the population returned to their peacetime pursuits , with the exception of some small roving bands of outlaws . In general , our relations with other countries can be said to have improved within the year . While having a due regard for our own affairs , the protection of our own rights , and the advancement of our own people , we can afford to be liberal toward others . Our example has become of great importance in the world . It is recognized that we are independent , detached , and can and do take a disinterested position in relation to international affairs . Our charity embraces the earth . Our trade is far flung . Our financial favors are widespread . Those who are peaceful and law abiding realize that not only have they nothing to fear from us , but that they can rely on our moral support . Proposals for promoting the peace of the world will have careful consideration . But we are not a people who are always seeking for a sign . We know that peace comes from honesty and fair dealing , from moderation , and a generous regard for the rights of others . The heart of the Nation is more important than treaties . A spirit of generous consideration is a more certain defense than great armaments . We should continue to promote peace by our example , and fortify it by such international covenants against war as we are permitted under our Constitution to make . AMERICAN PROGRESS Our country has made much progress . But it has taken , and will continue to take , much effort . Competition will be keen , the temptation to selfishness and arrogance will be severe , the provocations to deal harshly with weaker peoples will be many . All of these are embraced in the opportunity for true greatness . They will be overbalanced by cooperation by generosity , and a spirit of neighborly kindness . The forces of the universe are taking humanity in that direction . In doing good , in walking humbly , in sustaining its own people in ministering to other nations , America will work out its own mighty destiny .<speech_sep>
