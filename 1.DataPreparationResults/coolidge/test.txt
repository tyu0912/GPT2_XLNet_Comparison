My fellow Americans On the 22d day of February , 1932 , America will celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of George Washington . Wherever there are those who love ordered liberty , they may well join in the observance of that event . Although he belongs to us , yet by being a great American he became a great world figure . It is but natural that here under the shadow of the stately monument using to his memory , in the Capital City bearing his name , the country made independent by his military genius , and the Republic established by his statesmanship , should already begin preparations to proclaim the immortal honor in which we hold the Father of our Country . In recognition of the importance of this coming anniversary , more than two years ago the Congress passed a joint resolution establishing a commission , which was directed to have this address made to the American people reminding them of the reason and purpose for holding the coming celebration . It was also considered that now would be an appropriate time to inform the public that this commission desires to receive suggestions concerning plans for the proposed celebration and to express the hope that the States and their political subdivisions under the direction of their governors and local authorities would soon arrange for appointing commissions and committees to formulate programs for cooperation with the Federal Government . When the plans begin to be matured they should embrace the active support of educational and religious institutions , of the many civic , social , and fraternal organizations , agricultural and trade associations , and of other numerous activities which characterize our national life . It is greatly to be hoped that out of the studies pursued and the investigations made a more broad and comprehensive understanding and a more complete conception of Washington , the man , and his relation to all that is characteristic of American life may be secured . It was to be expected that he would be idealized by his countrymen . His living at a time when there were scantly reports in the public press , coupled with the inclination of early biographers , resulted in a rather imaginary character being created in response to the universal desire to worship his memory . The facts of his life were of record , but were not easily accessible . While many excellent books , often scholarly and eloquent , have been written about him , the temptation has been so wrong to represent him as an heroic figure composed of superlatives that the real man among men , the human being subjected to the trials and temptations common to all mortals , has been too much obscured and forgotten . When we regard him in this character and have revealed to us the judgment with which he met his problems , we shall all the more understand and revere his true greatness . No great mystery surrounds him he never relied on miracles . But he was a man endowed with what has been called uncommon common sense , with tireless industry , with a talent for taking infinite pains , and with a mind able to understand the universal and eternal problems of mankind . Washington has come to be known to the public almost exclusively as the Virginia colonel who accompanied the unfortunate expedition of General Braddock , as the commander in chief of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War , as the first President of the United States , and as the master of the beautiful estate at Mount Vernon . This general estimate is based to a large extent on the command he held in time of war and the public office he held in time of peace . A recital of his courage and patriotism , his loyalty and devotion , his self sacrifice , his refusal to being , will always arouse the imagination and aspire the soul of everyone who loves his country . Nothing can detract from the exalted place which this record entitles him to old . But he has an appeal even broader than this , which to day is equally valuable to the people of the United States . Not many of our citizens are to be called on take high commands or to hold high public office . We are all necessarily engaged in the ordinary affairs of life . As a valuable example to youth and to maturity , the experience of Washington in these directions is worthy of much more attention than it has received . We all share in the benefits which accrued from the independence he won and the free Republic he did so much to establish . We need a diligent comprehension and understanding of the great principles of government which he wrought out , but we shall also secure a wide practical advantage if we go beyond this record , already so eloquently expounded , and consider him also as a man of affairs . It was in this field that he developed that executive ability which he later displayed in the camp and in the council chamber . It ought always to be an inspiration to the young people of the country to know that from earliest youth Washington showed a disposition to make the most of his opportunities . He was diligently industrious a most admirable and desirable , if seemingly uninteresting , trait . His father , who had been educated in England , died when his son was 1 year old . His mother had but moderate educational advantages . There were no great incentives to learning in Virginia in 1732 , and the facilities for acquiring knowledge were still meager . The boy might well have grown up with very little education , but his eager mind and indomitable will led him to acquire learning and information despite the handicaps surrounding him . His formal schooling , which was of a rather primitive character , end at the age of 13 . His copy and exercise books , still in existence , contain forms of bills , receipts , and like documents , showing he had devoted considerable time to that branch of his studies . He was preparing himself to be a practical business man . When his regular instruction ended , his education was just beginning . It continued up to his death , December 14 , 1799 . If ever there was a self made man , it was George Washington . Through all his after years he was constantly absorbing knowledge from contact with men , from reading whenever time and facilities permitted , and from a wide correspondence . When 16 he became a surveyor and for our years earned a living and much experience in that calling . Although considerable has been written about it , not many people think of our first President as an agriculturist . He prepared a treatise on this subject . Those who have studied this phase of his life tell as he was probably the most successful owner and director of an agricultural estate in his day . A visitor in 1785 declared Washington s greatest pride was to be thought the first farmer in America . Toward the end of his life he wrote I am led to reflect how much more delightful to an undebauched mind is the task of making improvements on the earth than all the vain glory which can be acquired from ravaging it by the most uninterrupted career of conquests . He always had a great affection for Mount Vernon . He increased his land holdings from 2 , 500 to over 8 , 000 acres , 3 , 200 of which he had under cultivation at one time . His estate was managed in a thoroughly businesslike fashion . He kept a very careful net of account books for it , as he did for his other enterprises . Overseers made weekly statements showing just how each laborer had been employed , what crops had been planted or gathered . While he was absent reports were sent to him , and he replied in long letters of instruction , displaying wonderful familiarity with details . He was one of the first converts to the benefits of scientific fertilization and to the rotation of crops , for that purpose making elaborate tables covering five year periods . He overlooked no detail in carrying on his farm according to the practice of those days , producing on the premises most of the things needed there , even to shoes and textiles . He began the daily round of his fields at sunrise , and often removed his coat and helped his men in the work of the day . He also showed his business ability by the skillful way in which he managed the considerable estates left to his two stepchildren by their father . So successfully was this done that John Parke Curtis became , at the age of 21 , the richest young man in the Old Dominion . Prussing tells us that Martha Custis was advised to get the ablest man in the colony to manage her estate and to pay him any salary within reason . And he adds That she chose wisely in marrying the young colonel , and got the best of a good bargain , is the opinion of many . He was engaged in many business enterprises . That of the Dismal Swamp , comprising drainage and lumber operations south of Norfolk , was handled efficiently by Washington for five years subsequent to 1763 . In addition to his land holdings , wisely chosen , the rise in value of which accounted in no small degree for his fortune , Washington participated in a number of real estate and transportation companies . As a private citizen he was constantly on the outlook for sound investments and for ways to increase his capital . In the purchase of frontier lands and in the promotion of plans for the building up and development of new parts of the country he was performing important public service . Albert Bushnell Hart , distinguished historian , and a member of our commission , says Washington has been criticized for buying up land warrants and holding on to his title in the face of squatters . Actually no American has ever done so much to open up vast tracts of land , first under the British and then under the American flag , fitted to become the home of millions of American farmers . After 13 years of effort Washington forced the British Government to give to the Virginia veterans of the French and Indian wars the 200 , 000 acres of western lands promised by the Governor of that Colony . His management and distribution of these bounties were carried out in an eminently efficient and satisfactory manner . He acquired two large farms in Maryland . During a trip in New York State in 1783 he saw the possibilities of a waterway from the sea to the Great Lakes by way of the Hudson River and the Mohawk Valley the present route of a great barge canal . Because of his business vision the joined with General Clinton in the purchase of 6 , 000 acres near Utica . To Washington , the man of affairs , we owe our national banks , for had he followed the advice of other leaders , great but less enlightened on matters of finance , the plans of Alexander Hamilton would not have been realized . As a result of the war the country was deeply in debt , and had no credit but the solution of our financial difficulties suggested by the first Secretary of the Treasury was opposed by those from rural communities . They argued that the large commercial cities would dominate to the detriment of other parts of the country . Both Jefferson , Secretary of State , and Randolph , Attorney General , in writing opposed the incorporation by Congress of a national bank . They were joined by Madison and Monroe . All argued against the constitutionality of this proposition . Hamilton answered their arguments fully in his famous opinion . But , had the President not been a man of affairs , had he not been for many years a large holder of stock in the Bank of England , coming from the estate of Daniel Parke Custis , he might have yielded to the opposition . Because he knew something about bank accounts and bank credits the bill was signed and the foundation of our financial system laid . Washington was also a stockholder in the Bank of Alexandria and in the Bank of Columbia at Georgetown . In his last will and testament he directed that such moneys as should be derived from the sale of his estate during the lifetime of Washington should be invested for her in good bank stocks . After his retirement from the Presidency on March , 1797 , Washington spent more than two and a half happy years at Mount Vernon . In his last summer he made a will , one of the most remarkable documents of its kind of which we have record . Again he showed his versatility , in disposing of his many properties under a variety of bequests and conditions without legal advice . It has been called an autobiographic will it shows in its manifold provisions his charitable thoughtfulness for his dependents and his solicitude for the future welfare of his country . As President he was always an exponent of sound and honest public finance . He advocated the payment of our debts in full to holders of record , and the assumption by the Nation of the debts incurred by the various States to carry on the Revolution . His support of financial integrity , because it was morally right , strengthened the Union . The practical business ability and interest in broad and general affairs made him one of the first to realize that the future of the American Empire lay in the regions beyond the Alleghenies in the territory of the Ohio and the Mississippi . Because of this belief , he is said to have been the moving spirit in the first plans for the organization of our public lands . His association with the West may have started in the period 1749 1751 , when he assisted his brother , Lawrence , in his various business enterprises , among them the Ohio Company , which had a grant of 500 , 000 acres of land on the east side of the Ohio River . The French having driven out the early British settlers who had started a fort where Pittsburgh now stands , Washington , at the age of 21 , volunteered to head an expedition for its recovery . The comprehensive report of this young man was considered of enough importance to be sent from London to all the European capitals , by way of justifying Great Britain in making war upon France . In 1763 he organized the Mississippi Company to take the place of the Ohio Company , which was one of the casualties of the war . He applied for a grant of 1 , 000 , 000 acres of land , though he did not receive it . But he made his own investments so that in the schedule of his property attached to his will we find western lands appraised at over 400 , 000 along the Ohio , the Great Kanawha , in western Pennsylvania , in Kentucky , and in the Northwest Territory . Having a vision of what the West meant in the future prosperity of the new Republic , Washington in 1784 journeyed out into the wilds . His diary of the trip is filled with interest and enthusiasm over the possibilities of that region . Hulbert , who has made a study of it , calls him our first expansionist , the originator of the idea of possessing the West through commercial relations . It was a pioneer idea , instinct with genius , this author writes , and Washington s advocacy of it marks him as the first commercial American , the first man typical of the American that was to be . Due to his investments , he became the president of the James River Company and of the Potomac River Company , organized in 1785 to look into the possibility of opening navigation through to the West . To the Potomac Company , which involved the first interstate commerce negotiations in this country , he devoted four years of service . It has been thought that these negotiations entered into by Washington led up almost directly to the calling of the Constitutional Convention . They revealed clearly the difficulty under the Articles of Confederation of accomplishing anything involving the welfare of all the States , and showed the need of a more strongly centralized national government His ability as a business man was the strong support of his statesmanship . It made his political ideas intensely practical . Washington s Atlantic Mississippi waterway plan was never carried out . But his advocacy of it without doubt had much to do with preventing a break in the Union , which threatened serious consequences . The people of western North Carolina , now Tennessee , shut off from the East by mountains , had no outlet to the sea other than the Mississippi , and Spain , controlling the mouth of this river , levied heavy tribute on all commerce passing through it . Disappointed at the inability of the National Government to get concessions from Spain , they , in 1784 , established a separate State and started negotiations for an association with that foreign country . This action was rescinded after Washington put forth his waterway plan . That he should have been responsible in large measure for the opening of the West and for calling attention to the commercial advantages the country might derive therefrom is by no means the least of his benefactions to the Nation . He demonstrated that those who develop our resources , whether along agricultural , commercial , and industrial lines or in any field of endeavor , are entitled to the approval , rather than the censure , of their countrymen . Washington was a builder a creator . He had a national mind . He was constantly warning his countrymen of the danger of settling problems in accordance with sectional interests . His ideas in regard to the opening of our western territory were thought out primarily for the benefit of the Nation . It has been said that he would have been the greatest man in America had there been no Revolutionary War . He was largely instrumental in selecting the site for our National Capital , influenced in no small degree by his vision of the commercial possibilities of this locality . It included his plan of the waterway to the West , through the Potomac , the Monongahela , and the Ohio Rivers , which he used to speak of as the channel of commerce to the extensive and valuable trade of a rising Empire . He , of course , could not foresee the development of railway transportation and the great ocean going vessels , because of which the seat of our Government became separated from active contact with commerce and was left to develop as the cultural and intellectual center of the Nation . Due to the genius of L Enfant , the great engineer , this city from the first has had a magnificient plan of development . Its adoption was due in no small degree to the engineering foresight and executive ability of Washington . By 1932 we shall have made much progress toward perfecting the ideal city planned by him in the closing days of the eighteenth century . Washington had the ability to translate ideals into the practical affairs of life . He was interested in what he believed contributed to the betterment of every day existence . Perhaps because he realized the deficiency of his own early education , he was solicitous to provide liberal facilities for the youth of the future . Because as a man of affairs he knew the every day uses of learning , in an early message to the Congress and in his will he sought methods for the establishment of a national university . Even in this Farewell Address we find this exportation Promote , then , as an object of primary importance , institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge . In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion , it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened . He desired his system of education to be thoroughly American and thoroughly national . It was to support the people in a knowledge of their rights , in the creation of a republican spirit , and in the maintenance of the Union . It was with the same clear vision that he looked upon religion . For him there was little in it of emotionalism . He placed it on a firmer , more secure foundation , and stated the benefits which would accrue to his country as the results of faith in spiritual things . He recognized that religion was the main support of free institutions . In his Farewell Address he said Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity , religion and morality are indispensable supports . In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens . The mere politician , equally with the pious man , ought to respect and to cherish them . A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity . Let it simply be asked , Where is the security for property , for reputation , for life , if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion . Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure , reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle . It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government . The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government . Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric Without bigotry , without intolerance , he appeals to the highest spiritual nature of mankind . His genius has filled the earth . He has been recognized abroad as the greatest man of our own or any age . He loved his fellow men . He loved his country . That he intrusted their keeping to a Divine Province is revealed in the following prayer which he made in 1794 Let us united , in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations , to spread His holy protection over these United States to turn the machinations of the wicked , to the confirming of our Constitution to enable us , at all times , to root out internal sedition and put invasion to flight to perpetuate to our country that prosperity which His goodness has already conferred and to verify the anticipations of this Government being a safeguard of human rights . He was an idealist in the sense that he had a very high standard of private and public honor . He was a prophet to the extent of being able to forecast with remarkable vision the growth of the Nation he founded and the changing conditions which it would meet . But , essentially , he was a very practical man . He analyzed the problems before him with a clear intellect . Having a thorough understanding , he attacked them with courage and energy , with patience and persistence . He brought things to pass . When Patrick Henry was asked in 1774 whom he thought was the greatest man in the Continental Congress , he replied If you speak of eloquence , Rutledge , of South Carolina , is by far the greatest orator but if you speak of solid information and sound judgment , Colonel Washington is unquestionably the greatest man on that floor . His accomplishments were great because of an efficiency which marked his every act and a sublime , compelling faith in the ultimate triumph of the right . As we study his daily life , as we read his letters , his diaries , his papers , we come to realize more and more his wisdom , his energy , and his efficiency . He had the moral efficiency of an abiding religious faith , emphasizing the importance of spiritual side of man , the social efficiency shown by his interest in his fellow men , and in his realization of the inherent strength of a people united by a sense of equality and freedom , the business efficiency of a man of affairs , of the owner and manager of large properties , the governmental efficiency of the head of a new nation , who taking an untried political system made it operate successfully , of a leader able to adapt the relations of the government to the people . He understood how to translate political theory into a workable scheme of government . He knew that we can accomplish no permanent good by going to extremes . The law of reason must always be applied . He followed Milton , who declared law in a free nation hath ever been public reason , and he agreed with Burke that Men have no right to what is not reasonable . It is a mark of a great man that he surrounds himself by great men . Washington placed in the most important positions in his Cabinet , Jefferson , with his advocacy of the utmost degree of local self government and of States rights , and Hamilton , whose theories of a strong national government led him to advocate the appointment of State governors by the President . Either theory carried to the extreme soon would have brought disaster to what has proved the most successful experiment in liberty under proper governmental restraint in the history of the world . It is due to his memory that we guard the sovereign rights of the individual State under our Constitution with the same solicitude that we maintain the authority of the Federal Government in all matters vital to our continued national existence . Such is the background of a man performing the ordinary duties of life . As it was George Washington , of course he performed them extraordinarily well . The principles which he adopted in his early youth and maintained throughout his years are the source of all true greatness . Unless we understand this side of him , we shall fail in our comprehension of his true character . It was because of this training that he was able to assume the leadership of an almost impossible cause , carry it on through a long period of discouragement and defeat , and bring it to a successful conclusion . In advance of all others he saw that war was coming . With an army that was never large and constantly shifting , poorly supported by a confederation inexperienced , inefficient and lacking in almost all the essential elements of a government , he was victorious over the armies of seasoned troops commanded by Howe , Burgoyne , Clinton , and Cornwallis , supported by one of the most stable and solid of governments , possessed of enormous revenues and ample credit , representing the first military power of the world . As an example of generalship , extending over a series of years from the siege of Boston to the fall of Yorktown , the Commander in Chief of the Continental Armies holds a position that is unrivaled in the history of warfare . He never wavered , he never faltered from the day he modestly undertook the tremendous task of leading a revolution to the day when with equal modesty he surrendered his commission to the representatives of the independent Colonies . He triumphed over a people in the height of their glory who had acknowledged no victor for 700 years . Washington has come to personify the American Republic . He presided over the convention that framed our Constitution . The weight of his great name was the deciding factor in securing its adoption by the States . These results could never have been secured had it not been recognized that he would be the first President . When we realize what it meant to take 13 distracted Colonies , impoverished , envious , and hostile , and weld them into an orderly federation under the authority of a central government , we can form some estimate of the influence of this great man . But when we go further and remember that the Government which he did so much to bring into being not only did not falter when he retired from its administration , but , withstanding every assault , has constantly grown stronger with the passage of time and been found adequate to meet the needs of nearly 120 , 000 , 000 people occupying half a continent and constituting the greatest power the world has ever known , we can judge something of the breadth and soundness of his statesmanship . We have seen many soldiers who have left behind them little but the memory of their conflicts , but among all the victors the power to establish among a great people a form of self government which the test of experience has shown will endure was bestowed upon Washington , and Washington alone . Many others have been able to destroy . He was able to construct . That he had around him many great minds does not detract from his glory . His was the directing spirit without which there would have been no independence , no Union , no Constitution , and no Republic . His ways were the ways of truth . He built for eternity . His influence grows . His stature increases with the increasing years . In wisdom of action , in purity of character , he stands alone . We can not yet estimate him . We can only indicate our reverence for him and thank the Divine Providence which sent him to serve and inspire his fellow men .<speech_sep>Since the close of the last Congress the Nation has lost President Harding . The world knew his kindness and his humanity , his greatness and his character . He has left his mark upon history . He has made justice more certain and peace more secure . The surpassing tribute paid to his memory as he was borne across the continent to rest at last at home revealed the place lie held in the hearts of the American people . But this is not the occasion for extended reference to the man or his work . In this presence , among these who knew and loved him , that is unnecessary . But we who were associated with him could not resume together the functions of our office without pausing for a moment , and in his memory reconsecrating ourselves to the service of our country . He is gone . We remain . It is our duty , under the inspiration of his example , to take up the burdens which he was permitted to lay down , and to develop and support the wise principles of government which he represented . For us peace reigns everywhere . We desire to perpetuate it always by granting full justice to others and requiring of others full justice to ourselves . Our country has one cardinal principle to maintain in its foreign policy . It is an American principle . It must be an American policy . We attend to our own affairs , conserve our own strength , and protect the interests of our own citizens but we recognize thoroughly our obligation to help others , reserving to the decision of our own Judgment the time , the place , and the method . We realize the common bond of humanity . We know the inescapable law of service . Our country has definitely refused to adopt and ratify the covenant of the League of Nations . We have not felt warranted in assuming the responsibilities which its members have assumed . I am not proposing any change in this policy neither is the Senate . The incident , so far as we are concerned , is closed . The League exists as a foreign agency . We hope it will be helpful . But the United States sees no reason to limit its own freedom and independence of action by joining it . We shall do well to recognize this basic fact in all national affairs and govern ourselves accordingly . Our foreign policy has always been guided by two principles . The one is the avoidance of permanent political alliances which would sacrifice our proper independence . The other is the peaceful settlement of controversies between nations . By example and by treaty we have advocated arbitration . For nearly 25 years we have been a member of The Hague Tribunal , and have long sought the creation of a permanent World Court of Justice . I am in full accord with both of these policies . I favor the establishment of such a court intended to include the whole world . That is , and has long been , an American policy . Pending before the Senate is a proposal that this Government give its support to the Permanent Court of International Justice , which is a new and somewhat different plan . This is not a partisan question . It should not assume an artificial importance . The court is merely a convenient instrument of adjustment to which we could go , but to which we could not be brought . It should be discussed with entire candor , not by a political but by a judicial method , without pressure and without prejudice . Partisanship has no place in our foreign relations . As I wish to see a court established , and as the proposal presents the only practical plan on which many nations have ever agreed , though it may not meet every desire , I therefore commend it to the favorable consideration of the Senate , with the proposed reservations clearly indicating our refusal to adhere to the League of Nations . Our diplomatic relations , lately so largely interrupted , are now being resumed , but Russia presents notable difficulties . We have every desire to see that great people , who are our traditional friends , restored to their position among the nations of the earth . We have relieved their pitiable destitution with an . enormous charity . Our Government offers no objection to the carrying on of commerce by our citizens with the people of Russia . Our Government does not propose , however , to enter into relations with another regime which refuses to recognize the sanctity of international obligations . I do not propose to barter away for the privilege of trade any of the cherished rights of humanity . I do not propose to make merchandise of any American principles . These rights and principles must go wherever the sanctions of our Government go . But while the favor of America is not for sale , I am willing to make very large concessions for the purpose of rescuing the people of Russia . Already encouraging evidences of returning to the ancient ways of society can be detected . But more are needed . Whenever there appears any disposition to compensate our citizens who were despoiled , and to recognize that debt contracted with our Government , not by the Czar , but by the newly formed Republic of Russia whenever the active spirit of enmity to our institutions is abated whenever there appear works mete for repentance our country ought to be the first to go to the economic and moral rescue of Russia . We have every desire to help and no desire to injure . We hope the time is near at hand when we can act . The current debt and interest due from foreign Governments , exclusive of the British debt of 4 , 600 , 000 , 000 , is about 7 , 200 , 000 , 000 . 1 do not favor the cancellation of this debt , but I see no objection to adjusting it in accordance with the principle adopted for the British debt . Our country would not wish to assume the role of an oppressive creditor , but would maintain the principle that financial obligations between nations are likewise moral obligations which international faith and honor require should be discharged . Our Government has a liquidated claim against Germany for the expense of the army of occupation of over 255 , 000 , 000 . Besides this , the Mixed Claims Commission have before them about 12 , 500 claims of American citizens , aggregating about 1 , 225 , 000 , 000 . These claims have already been reduced by a recent decision , but there are valid claims reaching well toward 500 , 000 , 000 . Our thousands of citizens with credits due them of hundreds of millions of dollars have no redress save in the action of our Government . These are very substantial interests , which it is the duty of our Government to protect as best it can . That course I propose to pursue . It is for these reasons that we have a direct interest in the economic recovery of Europe . They are enlarged by our desire for the stability of civilization and the welfare of humanity . That we are making sacrifices to that end none can deny . Our deferred interest alone amounts to a million dollars every day . But recently we offered to aid with our advice and counsel . We have reiterated our desire to see France paid and Germany revived . We have proposed disarmament . We have earnestly sought to compose differences and restore peace . We shall persevere in well doing , not by force , but by reason . Under the law the papers pertaining to foreign relations to be printed are transmitted as a part of this message . Other volumes of these papers will follow . The foreign service of our Government needs to be reorganized and improved . Our main problems are domestic problems . Financial stability is the first requisite of sound government . We can not escape the effect of world conditions . We can not avoid the inevitable results of the economic disorders which have reached all nations . But we shall diminish their harm to us in proportion as we continue to restore our Government finances to a secure and endurable position . This we can and must do . Upon that firm foundation rests the only hope of progress and prosperity . From that source must come relief for the people . This is being , accomplished by a drastic but orderly retrenchment , which is bringing our expenses within our means . The origin of this has been the determination of the American people , the main support has been the courage of those in authority , and the effective method has been the Budget System . The result has involved real sacrifice by department heads , but it has been made without flinching . This system is a law of the Congress . It represents your will . It must be maintained , and ought to be strengthened by the example of your observance . Without a Budget System there can be no fixed responsibility and no constructive scientific economy . This great concentration of effort by the administration and Congress has brought the expenditures , exclusive of the self supporting Post . Office Department , down to three billion dollars . It is possible , in consequence , to make a large reduction in the taxes of the people , which is the sole object of all curtailment . This is treated at greater length in the Budget message , and a proposed plan has been presented in detail in a statement by the Secretary of the Treasury which has my unqualified approval . I especially commend a decrease on earned incomes , and further abolition of admission , message , and nuisance taxes . Tile amusement and educational value of moving pictures ought not to be taxed . Diminishing charges against moderate incomes from investment will afford immense relief , while a revision of the surtaxes will not only provide additional money for capital investment , thus stimulating industry and employing more but will not greatly reduce the revenue from that source , and may in the future actually increase it . Being opposed to war taxes in time of peace , I am not in favor of excess profits taxes . A very great service could be rendered through immediate enactment of legislation relieving the people of some of the burden of taxation . To reduce war taxes is to give every home a better chance . For seven years the people have borne with uncomplaining courage the tremendous burden of national and local taxation . These must both be reduced . The taxes of the Nation must be reduced now as much as prudence will permit , and expenditures must be reduced accordingly . High taxes reach everywhere and burden everybody . They gear most heavily upon the poor . They diminish industry and commerce . They make agriculture unprofitable . They increase the rates on transportation . They are a charge on every necessary of life . Of all services which the Congress can render to the country , I have no hesitation in declaring to neglect it , to postpone it , to obstruct it by unsound proposals , is to become unworthy of public confidence and untrue to public trust . The country wants this measure to have the right of way over an others . Another reform which is urgent in our fiscal system is the abolition of the right to issue tax exempt securities . The existing system not only permits a large amount of the wealth of the Notion to escape its just burden but acts as a continual stimulant to municipal extravagance . This should be prohibited by constitutional amendment . All the wealth of the Nation ought to contribute its fair share to the expenses of the Nation . The present tariff law has accomplished its two main objects . It has secured an abundant revenue and been productive of an abounding prosperity . Under it the country has had a very large export and import trade . A constant revision of the tariff by the Congress is disturbing and harmful . The present law contains an elastic provision authorizing the President to increase or decrease present schedules not in excess of 50 per centum to meet the difference in cost of production at home and abroad . This does not , to my mind , warrant a rewriting of the whole law , but does mean , and will be so administered , that whenever the required investigation shows that inequalities of sufficient importance exist in any schedule , the power to change them should and will be applied . The entire well being of our country is dependent upon transportation by sea and land . Our Government during the war acquired a large merchant fleet which should be transferred , as soon as possible , to private ownership and operation under conditions which would secure two results First , and of prime importance , adequate means for national defense second , adequate service to American commerce . Until shipping conditions are such that our fleet can be disposed of advantageously under these conditions , it will be operated as economically as possible under such plans as may be devised from time to time by the Shipping Board . We must have a merchant marine which meets these requirements , and we shall have to pay the cost of its service . The time has come to resume in a moderate way the opening of our intracoastal waterways the control of flood waters of the Mississippi and of the Colorado Rivers the improvement of the waterways from the Great Lakes toward the Gulf of Mexico and the development of the great power and navigation project of the Lawrence River , for which efforts are now being made to secure the necessary treaty with Canada . These projects can not all be undertaken at once , but all should have the immediate consideration of the Congress and be adopted as fast as plans can be matured and the necessary funds become available . This is not incompatible with economy , for their nature does not require so much a public expenditure as a capital investment which will be reproductive , as evidenced by the marked increase in revenue from the Panama Canal . Upon these projects depend much future industrial and agricultural progress . They represent the protection of large areas from flood and the addition of a great amount of cheap power and cheap freight by use of navigation , chief of which is the bringing of ocean going ships to the Great Lakes . Another problem of allied character is the superpower development of the Northeastern States , consideration of which is growing under the direction of the Department of Commerce by joint conference with the local authorities . Criticism of the railroad law has been directed , first , to the section laying down the rule by which rates are fixed , and providing for payment to the Government and use of excess earnings second , to the method for the adjustment of wage scales and third , to the authority permitting consolidations . It has been erroneously assumed that the act undertakes to guarantee railroad earnings . The law requires that rates should be just and reasonable . That has always been the rule under which rates have been fixed . To make a rate that does not yield a fair return results in confiscation , and confiscatory rates are of course unconstitutional . Unless the Government adheres to the rule of making a rate that will yield a fair return , it must abandon rate making altogether . The new and important feature of that part of the law is the recapture and redistribution of excess rates . The constitutionality of this method is now before the Supreme Court for adjudication . Their decision should be awaited before attempting further legislation on this subject . Furthermore , the importance of this feature will not be great if consolidation goes into effect . The settlement of railroad labor disputes is a matter of grave public concern . The Labor Board was established to protect the public in the enjoyment of continuous service by attempting to insure justice between the companies and their employees . It has been a great help , but is not altogether satisfactory to the public , the employees , or the companies . If a substantial agreement can be reached among the groups interested , there should be no hesitation in enacting such agreement into law . If it is not reached , the Labor Board may very well be left for the present to protect the public welfare . The law for consolidations is not sufficiently effective to be expeditious . Additional legislation is needed giving authority for voluntary consolidations , both regional and route , and providing Government machinery to aid and stimulate such action , always subject to the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission . This should authorize the commission to appoint committees for each proposed group , representing the public and the component roads , with power to negotiate with individual security holders for an exchange of their securities for those of the , consolidation on such terms and conditions as the commission may prescribe for avoiding any confiscation and preserving fair values . Should this permissive consolidation prove ineffective after a limited period , the authority of the Government will have to be directly invoked . Consolidation appears to be the only feasible method for the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation with an opportunity so to adjust freight rates as to meet such temporary conditions as now prevail in some agricultural sections . Competent authorities agree that an entire reorganization of the rate structure for freight is necessary . This should be ordered at once by the Congress . As no revision of the laws of the United States has been made since 1878 , a commission or committee should be created to undertake this work . The Judicial Council reports that two more district judges are needed in the southern district of New York , one in the northern district of Georgia , and two more circuit judges in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit . Legislation should be considered for this purpose . It is desirable to expedite the hearing and disposal of cases . A commission of Federal judges and lawyers should be created to recommend legislation by which the procedure in the Federal trial courts may be simplified and regulated by rules of court , rather than by statute such rules to be submitted to the Congress and to be in force until annulled or modified by the Congress . The Supreme Court needs legislation revising and simplifying the laws governing review by that court , and enlarging the classes of cases of too little public importance to be subject to review . Such reforms would expedite the transaction of the business of the courts . The administration of justice is likely to fail if it be long delayed . The National Government has never given adequate attention to its prison problems . It ought to provide employment in such forms of production as can be used by the Government , though not sold to the public in competition with private business , for all prisoners who can be placed at work , and for which they should receive a reasonable compensation , available for their dependents . Two independent reformatories are needed one for the segregation of women , and another for the segregation of young men serving their first sentence . The administration of justice would be facilitated greatly by including in the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice a Division of Criminal Identification , where there would be collected this information which is now indispensable in the suppression of crime . The prohibition amendment to the Constitution requires the Congress . and the President to provide adequate laws to prevent its violation . It is my duty to enforce such laws . For that purpose a treaty is being negotiated with Great Britain with respect to the ri lit of search of hovering vessels . To prevent smuggling , the Coast Card should be greatly strengthened , and a supply of swift power boats should be provided . The major sources of production should be rigidly regulated , and every effort should be made to suppress interstate traffic . With this action on the part of the National Government , and the cooperation which is usually rendered by municipal and State authorities , prohibition should be made effective . Free government has no greater menace than disrespect for authority and continual violation of law . It is the duty of a citizen not only to observe the law but to let it be known that he is opposed to its violation . Numbered among our population are some 12 , 000 , 000 colored people . Under our Constitution their rights are just as sacred as those of any other citizen . It is both a public and a private duty to protect those rights . The Congress ought to exercise all its powers of prevention and punishment against the hideous crime of lynching , of which the negroes are by no means the sole sufferers , but for which they furnish a majority of the victims . Already a considerable sum is appropriated to give the negroes vocational training in agriculture . About half a million dollars is recommended for medical courses at Howard University to help contribute to the education of 500 colored doctors needed each year . On account of the integration of large numbers into industrial centers , it has been proposed that a commission be created , composed of members from both races , to formulate a better policy for mutual understanding and confidence . Such an effort is to be commended . Everyone would rejoice in the accomplishment of the results which it seeks . But it is well to recognize that these difficulties are to a large extent local problems which must be worked out by the mutual forbearance and human kindness of each community . Such a method gives much more promise of a real remedy than outside interference . The maintenance and extension of the classified civil service is exceedingly important . There are nearly 550 , 000 persons in the executive civil service drawing about 700 , 000 , 000 of yearly compensation . Four fifths of these are in the classified service . This method of selection of the employees of the United States is especially desirable for the Post Office Department . The Civil Service Commission has recommended that postmasters at first , second , and third class offices be classified . Such action , accompanied by a repeal of the four year term of office , would undoubtedly be an improvement . I also recommend that the field force for prohibition enforcement be brought within the classified civil service without covering in the present membership . The best method for selecting public servants is the merit system . Many of the departments in Washington need better housing facilities . Some are so crowded that their work is impeded , others are so scattered that they lose their identity . While I do not favor at this time a general public building law , I believe it is now necessary , in accordance with plans already sanctioned for a unified and orderly system for the development of this city , to begin the carrying out of those plans by authorizing the erection of three or four buildings most urgently needed by an annual appropriation of 5 , 000 , 000 . Cooperation with other maritime powers is necessary for complete protection of our coast waters from . pollution . Plans for this are under way , but await certain experiments for refuse disposal . Meantime laws prohibiting spreading oil and oil refuse from vessels in our own territorial waters would be most helpful against this menace and should be speedily enacted . Laws should be passed regulating aviation . Revision is needed of the laws regulating radio interference . Legislation and regulations establishing load liner , to provide safe loading of vessels leaving our ports are necessary and recodification of our navigation laws is vital . Revision of procedure of the Federal Trade Commission will give more constructive purpose to this department . If our Alaskan fisheries are to be saved from destruction , there must be further legislation declaring a general policy and delegating the authority to make rules and regulations to an administrative body . For several years we have been decreasing the personnel of the Army and Navy , and reducing their power to the danger point . Further reductions should not be made . The Army is a guarantee of the security of our citizens at home the Navy is a guarantee of the security of our citizens abroad . Both of these services should be strengthened rather than weakened . Additional planes are needed for the Army , and additional submarines for the Navy . The defenses of Panama must be perfected . We want no more competitive armaments . We want no more war . But we want no weakness that invites imposition . A people who neglect their national defense are putting in jeopardy their national honor . Conditions in the insular possessions on the whole have been good . Their business has been reviving . They are being administered according to law . That effort has the full support of the administration . Such recommendations as may conic from their people or their governments should have the most considerate attention . Our National Government is not doing as much as it legitimately can do to promote the welfare of the people . Our enormous material wealth , our institutions , our whole form of society , can not be considered fully successful until their benefits reach the merit of every individual . This is not a suggestion that the Government should , or could , assume for the people the inevitable burdens of existence . There is no method by which we can either be relieved of the results of our own folly or be guaranteed a successful life . There is an inescapable personal responsibility for the development of character , of industry , of thrift , and of self control . These do not come from the Government , but from the people themselves . But the Government can and should always be expressive of steadfast determination , always vigilant , to maintain conditions under which these virtues are most likely to develop and secure recognition and reward . This is the American policy . It is in accordance with this principle that we have enacted laws for the protection of the public health and have adopted prohibition in narcotic drugs and intoxicating liquors . For purposes of national uniformity we ought to provide , by constitutional amendment and appropriate legislation , for a limitation of child labor , and in all cases under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Government a minimum wage law for women , which would undoubtedly find sufficient power of enforcement in the influence of public opinion . Having in mind that education is peculiarly a local problem , and that it should always be pursued with the largest freedom of choice by students and parents , nevertheless , the Federal Government might well give the benefit of its counsel and encouragement more freely in this direction . If anyone doubts the need of concerted action by the States of the Nation for this purpose , it is only necessary to consider the appalling figures of illiteracy representing a condition which does not vary much in all parts of the Union . I do not favor the making of appropriations from the National Treasury to be expended directly on local education , but I do consider it a fundamental requirement of national activity which , accompanied by allied subjects of welfare , is worthy of a separate department and a place in the Cabinet . The humanitarian side of government should not be repressed , but should be cultivated . Mere intelligence , however , is not enough . Enlightenment must be accompanied by that moral power which is the product of the home and of rebellion . Real education and true welfare for the people rest inevitably on this foundation , which the Government can approve and commend , but which the people themselves must create . American institutions rest solely on good citizenship . They were created by people who had a background of self government . New arrivals should be limited to our capacity to absorb them into the ranks of good citizenship . America must be kept American . For this i purpose , it is necessary to continue a policy of restricted immigration . It would be well to make such immigration of a selective nature with some inspection at the source , and based either on a prior census or upon the record of naturalization . Either method would insure the admission of those with the largest capacity and best intention of becoming citizens . I am convinced that our present economic and social conditions warrant a limitation of those to be admitted . We should find additional safety in a law requiring the immediate registration of all aliens . Those who do not want to be partakers of the American spirit ought not to settle in America . No more important duty falls on the Government of the United States than the adequate care of its veterans . Those suffering disabilities incurred in the service must have sufficient hospital relief and compensation . Their dependents must be supported . Rehabilitation and vocational training must be completed . All of this service must be clean , must be prompt and effective , and it must be administered in a spirit of the broadest and deepest human sympathy . If investigation reveals any present defects of administration or need Of legislation , orders will be given for the immediate correction of administration , and recommendations for legislation should be given the highest preference . At present there are 9 , 500 vacant beds in Government hospitals , I recommend that all hospitals be authorized at once to receive and care for , without hospital pay , the veterans of all wars needing such care , whenever there are vacant beds , and that immediate steps be taken to enlarge and build new hospitals to serve all such cases . The American Legion will present to the Congress a legislative pro gram too extensive for detailed discussion here . It is a carefully matured plan . While some of it I do not favor , with much of it I am in hearty accord , and I recommend that a most painstaking effort be made to provide remedies for any defects in the administration of the present laws which their experience has revealed . The attitude of the Government toward these proposals should be one of generosity . But I do not favor the granting of a bonus . The cost of coal has become unbearably high . It places a great burden on our industrial and domestic life . The public welfare requires a reduction in the price of fuel . With the enormous deposits in existence , failure of supply ought not to be tolerated . Those responsible for the conditions in this industry should undertake its reform and free it from any charge of profiteering The report of the Coal Commission will be before the Congress . It comprises all the facts . It represents the mature deliberations and conclusions of the best talent and experience that ever made a national survey of the production and distribution of fuel . I do not favor Government ownership or operation of coal mines . The need is for action under private ownership that will secure greater continuity of production and greater public protection . The Federal Government probably has no peacetime authority to regulate wages , prices , or profits in coal at the mines or among dealers , but by ascertaining and publishing facts it can exercise great influence . The source of the difficulty in the bituminous coal fields is the intermittence of operation which causes great waste of both capital and labor . That part of the report dealing with this problem has much significance , and is suggestive of necessary remedies . By amending , the car rules , by encouraging greater unity of ownership , and possibly by permitting common selling agents for limited districts on condition that they accept adequate regulations and guarantee that competition between districts be unlimited , distribution , storage , and continuity ought to be improved . The supply of coal must be constant . In case of its prospective interruption , the President should have authority to appoint a commission empowered to deal with whatever emergency situation might arise , to aid conciliation and voluntary arbitration , to adjust any existing or threatened controversy between the employer and the employee when collective bargaining fails , and by controlling distribution to prevent profiteering in this vital necessity . This legislation is exceedingly urgent , and essential to the exercise of national authority for the protection of the people . Those who undertake the responsibility of management or employment in this industry do so with the full knowledge that the public interest is paramount , and that to fail through any motive of selfishness in its service is such a betrayal of duty as warrants uncompromising action by the Government . A special joint committee has been appointed to work out a plan for a reorganization of the different departments and bureaus of the Government more scientific and economical than the present system . With the exception of the consolidation of the War and Navy Departments and some minor details , the plan has the general sanction of the President and the Cabinet . It is important that reorganization be enacted into law at the present session . Aided by the sound principles adopted by the Government , the business of the country has had an extraordinary revival . Looked at as a whole , the Nation is in the enjoyment of remarkable prosperity . Industry and commerce are thriving . For the most tart agriculture is successful , eleven staples having risen in value from about 5 , 300 , 000 , 000 two years ago to about . 7 , 000 , 000 , 000 for the current year . But range cattle are still low in price , and some sections of the wheat area , notably Minnesota , North Dakota , and on west , have many cases of actual distress . With his products not selling on a parity with the products of industry , every sound remedy that can be devised should be applied for the relief of the farmer . He represents a character , a type of citizenship , and a public necessity that must be preserved and afforded every facility for regaining prosperity . The distress is most acute among those wholly dependent upon one crop . . Wheat acreage was greatly expanded and has not yet been sufficiently reduced . A large amount is raised for export , which has to meet the competition in the world market of large amounts raised on land much cheaper and much more productive . No complicated scheme of relief , no plan for Government fixing of prices , no resort to the public Treasury will be of any permanent value in establishing agriculture . Simple and direct methods put into operation by the farmer himself are the only real sources for restoration . Indirectly the farmer must be relieved by a reduction of national and local taxation . He must be assisted by the reorganization of the freight rate structure which could reduce charges on his production . To make this fully effective there ought to be railroad consolidations . Cheaper fertilizers must be provided . He must have organization . His customer with whom he exchanges products o he farm for those of industry is organized , labor is organized , business is organized , and there is no way for agriculture to meet this unless it , too , is organized . The acreage of wheat is too large . Unless we can meet the world market at a profit , we must stop raising for export . Organization would help to reduce acreage . Systems of cooperative marketing created by the farmers themselves , supervised by competent management , without doubt would be of assistance , but , the can not wholly solve the problem . Our agricultural schools ought to have thorough courses in the theory of organization and cooperative marketing . Diversification is necessary . Those farmers who raise their living on their land are not greatly in distress . Such loans as are wisely needed to assist buying stock and other materials to start in this direction should be financed through a Government agency as a temporary and emergency expedient . The remaining difficulty is the disposition of exportable wheat . I do not favor the permanent interference of the Government in this problem . That probably would increase the trouble by increasing production . But it seems feasible to provide Government assistance to exports , and authority should be given the War Finance Corporation to grant , in its discretion , the most liberal terms of payment for fats and grains exported for the direct benefit of the farm . The Government is undertaking to develop a great water power project known as Muscle Shoals , on which it has expended many million dollars . The work is still going on . Subject to the right to retake in time of war , I recommend that this property with a location for auxiliary steam plant and rights of way be sold . This would end the present burden of expense and should return to the Treasury the largest price possible to secure . While the price is an important element , there is another consideration even more compelling . The agriculture of the Nation needs a greater supply and lower cost of fertilizer . This is now imported in large quantities . The best information I can secure indicates that present methods of power production would not be able profitably to meet the price at which these imports can be sold . To obtain a supply from this water power would require long and costly experimentation to perfect a process for cheap production . Otherwise our purpose would fail completely . It seems desirable , therefore , in order to protect and promote the public welfare , to have adequate covenants that such experimentation be made and carried on to success . The great advantage of low priced nitrates must be secured for the direct benefit of the farmers and the indirect benefit of the public in time of peace , and of the Government in time of war . If this main object be accomplished , the amount of money received for the property is not a primary or major consideration . Such a solution will involve complicated negotiations , and there is no authority for that purpose . therefore recommend that the Congress appoint a small joint committee to consider offers , conduct negotiations , and report definite recommendations . By reason of many contributing causes , occupants of our reclamation projects are in financial difficulties , which in some cases are acute . Relief should be granted by definite authority of law empowering the Secretary of the Interior in . his discretion to suspend , readjust , and reassess all charges against water users . This whole question is being considered by experts . You will have the advantage of the facts and conclusions which they may develop . This situation , involving a Government investment of more than 135 , 000 , 000 , and affecting more than 30 , 000 water users , is serious . While relief which is necessary should be granted , yet contracts with the Government which can be met should be met . The established general policy of these projects should not be abandoned for any private control . Highways and reforestation should continue to have the interest and support of the Government . Everyone is anxious for good highways . I have made a liberal proposal in the Budget for the continuing payment to the States by the Federal Government of its share for this necessary public improvement . No expenditure of public money contributes so much to the national wealth as for building good roads . Reforestation has an importance far above the attention it usually secures . A special committee of the Senate is investigating this need , and I shall welcome a constructive policy based on their report . It is 100 years since our country announced the Monroe doctrine . This principle has been ever since , and is now , one of the main foundations of our foreign relations . It must be maintained . But in maintaining it we must not be forgetful that a great change has taken place . We are no longer a weak Nation , thinking mainly of defense , dreading foreign imposition . We are great and powerful . New powers bring new responsibilities . Our ditty then was to protect ourselves . Added to that , our duty now is to help give stability to . the world . We want idealism . We want that vision which lifts men and nations above themselves . These are virtues by reason of their own merit . But they must not be cloistered they must not be impractical they must not be ineffective . The world has had enough of the curse of hatred and selfishness , of destruction and war . It has had enough of the wrongful use of material power . For the healing of the nations there must be good will and charity , confidence and peace . The time has come for a more practical use of moral power , and more reliance upon the principle that right makes its own might . Our authority among the nations must be represented by justice and mercy . It is necessary not only to have faith , but to make sacrifices for our faith . The spiritual forces of the world make all its final determinations . It is with these voices that America should speak . Whenever they declare a righteous purpose there need be no doubt that they will be heard . America has taken her place in the world as a Republic free , independent , powerful . The best service that can be rendered to humanity is the assurance that this place will be maintained .<speech_sep>After 150 anniversaries repeatedly observed , followed during the last three months by intensive celebration , in this neighborhood where it had its beginnings , the American Revolution should be fairly well understood . If it needs any justification , if it needs any praise , it is enough to say that its product is America . It ought to be unnecessary on this occasion to dwell very much on that event and its yet more remarkable results . But no great movement in the progress of mankind has ever been accomplished without the guidance of an inspired leadership . Of this accepted truth , there is no more preeminent example than that which was revealed by the war which made this country independent . Wherever men love liberty , wherever they believe in patriotism , wherever they exalt high character , by universal consent they turn to the name of George Washington . No occasion could be conceived more worthy , more truly and comprehensively American , than that which is chosen to commemorate this divinely appointed captain . The contemplation of his life and work will forever strengthen our faith in our country and in our country s God . Those men who have taken great parts in the world are commonly ranked by posterity according to their accomplishment while living , and the permanent worth of the monuments representing their achievements which remain after they are gone . By this standard I think we may regard George Washington as the first lay citizen of the world of all time . He was one in whom the elements of greatness were so evenly blended , so accurately proportioned , that his character has well nigh defied analysis . Others have created wider commotion and deeper impression in the hour of their eminence . But we shall hardly find one who in his own day achieved so much as Washington and left his work so firmly established that posterity , generation after generation , can only increase its tributes to his ability , his wisdom , his patriotism , and his rounded perfection in the character of a Christian citizen . No figure in profane history has inspired so many testimonies of admiration . The highest eloquence , the most profound sincerity , have been invoked to picture him as the very sum of public capacities and civic virtues . No pride of race or country has even attempted to set up rivals to him . Envy and malice have stood rebuked in the presence of his towering form . There is no language of literature and culture which does not boast among its adornments noble eulogies of the work and character of Washington . Although , as history reckons its periods , it is but a little time since he passed from the stage of life , he has been claimed , wherever men struggle and aspire , as the possession of all humanity , the first citizen of all the ages . So he must be a strangely bold and self confident eulogist who would attempt even on such an occasion as this to add anything to the total of affection , admiration , and reverence which has been reared as the true memorial of Washington . It is impossible for us to add to or take from the estimate which has been fixed by the generations of the world . But if the preeminent place of Washington is thus established beyond possibility of change at our hands , it is only the more desirable that on this anniversary we should come here to do our reverence and to seek replenishment of the inspiration which is always to be drawn from consideration of his life and works . To the people of the Republic whose existence is due to his leadership , his life is the full and finished teaching of citizenship . To others , who may claim him only by virtue of the right of humanity to be heir to all the ages , his story is replete with example and admonition peculiarly applicable to the problems of the world and its people in these times . We have come here , because this day a century and a half ago , and in this place , Washington formally assumed command of the armies of the Colonies . His feet trod this soil . Here was his headquarters . Here was his place of worship . Our first view therefore is of Washington the soldier . But he was indeed so much more than the soldier his talents were so many and so perfectly proportioned , that it is impossible to study him in any one of his capacities , to the exclusion of the others . In him we find also a marvelous instinct for statecraft , supporting and sustaining an equal genius for camp and field . We see moreover the qualities of a great man of business , which be brings to serve the vast task of organizing and equipping his armies . We find him on one day writing a noble and eloquent rebuke to a commander of the King s forces who was bent on waiving the laws of civilized warfare and on another , addressing compelling counsels of patriotism , energy , and executive sense , to the Continental Congress and the provincial legislatures . In everything he was called to be the leader . In everything , his leadership wrought results which completely vindicated the confidence reposed in him . The complaint has been many times uttered that Washington was no nearly a paragon of abilities and virtues that it is impossible to see through the aura of perfections to the real , simple , human man . But there is a phase of Washington s career which , fully studied and understood , will give us the picture of him as one of the most human men in history . To inform ourselves of this human side , we need only to know of the long years of arduous preparation which preceded the historic event which took place here 150 years ago to day . From his earliest manhood , Washington s life had been a part of great affairs . Many of those affairs were vastly greater and more significant than he himself , or indeed anybody else , could possibly have realized at the time . He had come up through a schooling of strangely mingled adversities and successes . He had devoted hard and disappointing years to activities which resulted , aside from the training which he derived , in little more than hopeless futilities . Nobody can know the real Washington , the man Washington , without studying closely his services to the Virginia Colony and the British Crown during the years immediately preceding and covering the old French War . Here we see him as a young man , in whom the combination of rare and remarkable parts is most easily discerned . We find him , at times , hot headed and impetuous , always intensely impatient with incompetency in places of authority . From the beginning we discover a special genius for commanding the respect and attention of older men . When hardly more than a boy he was chosen for a responsible and difficult mission to the French on the western frontier . This mission brought him in contact with an important French officer who reported to his Government that this young man was likely to make more trouble for French interests in America than any 50 other people . That observation was more profound than its maker could have realized . Washington had been sent with a small force , as the emissary of Governor Dinwiddie , of Virginia , to notify the French that their aggressions in the upper Ohio territory were occasion of deep concern to the British colonies , and must cease . It was the wish of Washington and his superiors that the message be delivered without bringing about any clash at arms . But events decreed otherwise , and a skirmish took place in the wilderness in which a number of men were killed and wounded , among them a French officer of some rank and importance . It is deeply suggestive of the destiny which had marked Washington that this backwoods brush at arms should have occasioned the first bloodshed in that long series of wars which was to drench the Western World for near two generations , and did not end until the downfall of Napoleon . From the day of that clash in the western forests of Pennsylvania , precipitated by the determination of Washington to execute his mission , the Seven Years War was a foregone conclusion . Washington was denounced in France as a murderer , a man eating freebooter of the wilds . In England his boldness and determination won him a good deal of reputation . In the Colonies there was much difference of opinion , for the time being , whether his course was justified or had brought the country face to face with the possibility of a disastrous struggle . At any rate , from that day until the downfall of Napoleon at Waterloo , there was no peace in either Europe or America , save for brief periods which represented little more than temporary truces . Doubtless that long and fearful series of conflicts was inevitable . Whether it was or not , the facts of history show Washington , a youth of 22 , as the commander whose order proved the torch to set a world on fire . From that hour , responsible men in both Britain and France realized that there could be no lasting peace until those countries had fought the duel which should determine the supremacy of one or the other in the New World . There was not room for both . So came the Seven Years War and the establishment of British domination in North America . A little later came the American Revolution , the French Revolution , and the Napoleonic wars . One can but wonder what might have been the reflections of Washington , if he could have imagined on that July morning of 1754 , when he resolved that he must fight , if he could have known the train of events that would follow upon his determination . But such conjecture is of little value . To us there is more of immediate interest in the curious coincidence that the skirmish for possession of Fort Necessity took place on July 3 , 1754 , exactly 21 years before the day when Washington in this place assumed command of the Continental Army . And those 21 years , as Washington lived them , constituted a fitting probation for the career that awaited him . The echoes of the little battle of Fort Necessity reverberated throughout the American Colonies and the European courts as if it had been an engagement of Titans . Its political effects were tremendous . It made Washington a marked man throughout the Colonies and gave him a real European reputation . His part in the Braddock expedition , though vastly better known , probably had less effect in forming his character or directing his career than his expedition to Fort Necessity . Nevertheless , his reputation was further increased by his conduct in the Braddock campaign . But that heroic episode was followed by a long and disappointing experience as head of the Virginia Forces defending the western frontier . He saw little of satisfying service during this period . But he learned the supreme importance of organization and preparation in connection with military operations . In the end it was his privilege to lead his Virginians to the occupation of Fort Pitt , when it was finally surrendered by the French . But the real campaign for control of the Ohio Valley was made from the north by General Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham rather than from Virginia , and Washington found his part in it disappointingly small . Not only the Braddock campaign of 1755 , but his earlier operations , both diplomatic and military , on the upper Ohio , marked him as a man of caution , sagacity , and wisdom in planning and conducting military operations . At the same time , they showed him as the intrepid and fearless fighting soldier in the hours of action . One thing that Washington learned during the French War must have contributed greatly to form his opinions about relations between Britain and the Colonies . He was brought to realize that the form of colonial government , with which bitter experience made him so familiar , could not long satisfy the people of the larger , wealthier , and fast growing Colonies . With Washington , the idea of substantial freedom long preceded that of independence . Like most of the colonial youth , he hoped that a more enlightened policy in London and a more sympathetic execution of it by the royal governors might compose the growing differences . During the troublous epoch between the French War and the Revolution he thought deeply of these matters , and his correspondence gives evidence of the growing impression that a contest must come . He followed the development of events in Massachusetts with a close and understanding concern . His writings and occasional public pronouncements during this period show him acutely anxious that the Colonies should present a united front when the test came . One in his position of leadership , authority , and independent fortune , living as a Virginia gentleman , might easily enough have felt that the troubles of the Massachusetts Bay Colony had small concern for him . High Churchman , conformist in most things , enjoying excellent repute in England and with English officials in America , his influence might logically enough have been thrown to the royalists . Yet , as early as the spring of 1769 , he wrote declaring , Our lordly masters in Great Britain will be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of American Freedom . And , inquiring what could be done to avert such a calamity , he added , That no man should scruple or hesitate a moment to use arms in defense of so valuable a blessing is clearly my opinion . Yet , arms , I would beg to add , should be the last resource . A little later , in that same year , Washington , at a public meeting , offered a nonimportation resolution and secured its adoption . In short , it is plain that he was anxious to keep the sentiment of the southern Colonies fully in step and sympathy with the attitude of the New England patriots who at the moment were bearing the brunt of the struggle or colonial rights . Seemingly , the Boston port bill convinced him that the Colonies must prepare for the harshest eventualities . At a meeting of the citizens of his county he helped draft a petition and remonstrance to the King , which concluded with the ominous words , From our sovereign there can be but the appeal . Such a declaration , coming from one whose repute was high in all the Colonies , and who was beginning to speak with the voice of something like authority for the southern communities , could not fail to strengthen the arm and purpose of the New Englanders . The selection of Washington to command the Continental Armies has , I think , been too much attributed to his high military repute and too little to the fact that he had long taken the view of a true statesman regarding the impending crisis . The fact is that he had all along seen the struggle as a continental and national one . He realized that Massachusetts could not win alone , nor could New England . In helping to set up the committee of correspondence , in molding the sentiment of Virginia , in his service as member of the Continental Congress , the ideal of a firm and whole hearted union of all the Colonies was plainly fundamental . Repeatedly , in his writings , even long before the struggle had seriously suggested the possibility of war , he used the phrase , Our Country , giving it an application vastly broader than the domain or concerns of any single colony . He was among the first to see the vision of an American Nation . No other man so early grasped certain physical and geographic arguments which urged nationality as inevitable . In this , his engineering training , together with his intimate knowledge of the topography of the Ohio and Potomac Valleys , had an important part . As a young surveyor he realized the importance of that break through the Allegheny system which these two valleys mark . Many years later he pointed out its strategic importance in connection with the defense and unity of the Colonies fronting the Atlantic . Before the Ohio was much more than a myth to most people , even in Virginia , Washington saw that the Ohio basin must be controlled by the Colonies if they were to be secure . Thus it was that a complete and clear vision of all the arguments for national unity was due to the many sidedness of the Washington mind . He saw it as politician , as statesman , as military man , as engineer . Without such a grasp of all the elements , he could not have taken the statesmanly and essentially national view of the problem before hostilities began . Nor could he have dealt effectively with its military aspects during the war . He possessed one of those rarely endowed minds which not only recognize all the factors , but assign to each its proper weight . He was in truth a consummate politician . When he went to the sittings of the Continental Congress , wearing his Virginia uniform of buff and blue , some were inclined to ridicule the display of military predilection . They accused him of swashbuckling , and pointed to his uniform as equivalent to announcement of his candidacy for commander in chief . In the first , they were utterly wrong in the second , quite probably right . That uniform , when he presided over the committees on military preparation , could hardly have been construed as meaning anything other than that its wearer realized what was ahead and was willing to force some part of that realization on others . I suppose if we were to pick any two men out of that gathering , to be set down as something other than politicians , Washington and sturdy old John Adams would be well toward the top in the polling . Though they approached the matter from utterly different angles , they were both led by the sagacity of great politicians to the same conclusion . To both , the crisis was essentially national . A nation must be created to deal with it . The army before Boston must be taken over by the Congress as a national army . There must be a Commander in Chief , supreme in the military field . All this we look back upon as illumined statesmanship . But statesmanship is nothing more than good , sound politics , tested and proved . That is what it was when John Adams conceived the great strategy of calling a man of the South to the chief command . A more provincial man might have dreamed of Massachusetts , aided by the other colonies , taking and holding the lead and garnering the lion s share of glory . But Adams was planning in terms of a nation , not of provinces and Washington had for years been writing of Our Country . So Washington put on his uniform in testimony of his readiness for whatever might happen , and Adams , after some period of misgivings , set about convincing the delegates from New England and the middle Colonies that there must be a nation , and a national army , with a Commander in Chief , and that must be Washington . It was a stroke of political genius that Adams , soul of Puritanic idealism , should have moved the adoption of the army by Congress and the selection of Washington as commander in chief . The selection was made without a dissenting vote , though it is not true to say that Washington was unanimously preferred . Already there were clashing ambitions and divergent community interests . But Adams saw , and made others see , the peculiar reasons that urged Washington . The middle Colonies , dominated by their landed aristocracies , had much in common with the social and economic system of the South . To them Washington meant the enlistment of property , substance , and eminent respectability . In presenting his name to the Congress Adams described him in terms which seem prophetic , and which we can hardly improve A gentleman , whose skill and experience as an officer , whose independent fortune , great talents , and excellent universal character would command the approbation of all America and unite the cordial exertions of all the Colonies better than any other person in the Union . Let it ever be set down to the glory of Massachusetts that John Adams made George Washington Commander in Chief of the Continental Armies and John Marshall Chief Justice of the United States . Destiny could have done no more . Immediately after his selection , Washington set out from Philadelphia for Boston . On the way he received first tidings of the Battle of Bunker Hill , which had been fought two days after he was named for commander . He inquired eagerly about the behavior of the continental troops , and when he learned now splendidly they had fought against the British regulars he quietly declared that the liberties of the country were safe . In that anxious hour the battle of 20 years earlier in the Pennsylvania woods , wherein his Virginia militia had saved Braddock s regulars from destruction , no doubt was near the top of his mind . To be assured that the raw levies of New England were capable of behaving just as well in 1775 as his Virginians had done in 1755 must have been intensely reassuring . Knowing the story of the Revolution as we do , we can not doubt that the historic event which took place here 150 years ago to day marked one of its crises . Even with Washington , the struggle was well nigh lost at several periods . Of course , the ultimate separation of the Colonies from the mother country was inevitable . He had the Revolution of 1775 failed , as it must have failed without Washington , there would have been harsh and vindictive reprisals . Nobody can read the arrogant pronouncements of Lord North s government or the still more arrogant letters of General Gage to Washington and avoid conviction that the British Government and its American military representatives would have vied with each other in efforts to estrange the Colonies . Such a policy would have established traditions of animosity that would have kept the struggle alive even after a nominal peace . In the end separation would have come . But it might have been delayed through many recurrences of turbulence and struggle . It was vastly to the good of both the mother country and the Colonies that , the conflict being once begun , it was brought to a decisive conclusion . There is another reason why the final victory of the Colonies was important to the world . It was just as necessary for the maintenance of the British Empire as for the proper development of the American community . I believe this view is now generally accepted by British students as well as Americans . We may be sure that it was in the mind of the great Chatham , who had laid the foundations of the British Empire in the Seven Years War . If there was a man in all that realm who might well have been given attention when the American crisis was developing , that man was Chatham . He had found Britain weak and had built it into strength . He had well nigh made the whole North American Continent British . He had reestablished the empire and extended it in many directions . Yet Chatham knew that Lord North s policies would surely cost the loss of the American dominion . Emerging from a long political retirement , defying the doctors he hated and the King he had served , the grand old man hurried down to the House of Lords to pronounce his allegiance to the cause of the Colonies . When your lordships , said he , look at the papers transmitted to us from America when you consider their decency , their firmness , their wisdom , you can not but respect their cause and wish to make it your own . That decency , firmness , and wisdom were in no small part George Washington . Chatham knew what it had been to build an empire he would not see it thrown away without having his protest heard . He spoke the voice of liberalism in England but the King and his ministers had no ear for such counsels . They had fixed their course and could not be swerved . Washington s assumption of the command gave the colonial cause an effective national character . Had he not possessed the genius and the power to impress others with that conception , it is hardly conceivable that disaster could long have been postponed . He found himself in command of an unorganized , undisciplined , unprovisioned , and unmunitoned body of some 14 , 000 militia , opposing an army of 11 , 000 regulars shut up in Boston and supported by a naval power that completely commanded the seas . Washington was called first to make an army , then to drive his enemy out of Boston , and then to meet attack at whatever point along the coast the enemy might choose . Where many others , quite as sincere in their patriotism , fondly imagined that the evacuation of Boston would move the London government to make peace , he was convinced that it would be little more than the beginning . For the long struggle he foresaw , he had to prepare , not only by creating an army but by convincing the civil authority and the people that he must have the utmost measure of their support and cooperation . So we find him , immediately upon assuming his command , dividing his time between military tasks and the writing of endless letters to the leaders of the Congress , to the provincial assemblies , to men of importance everywhere , designed to impress them with the enormity of the coming struggle . This is not the time or place for a review of Washington s military career . Yet there are phases of that career which I am never able to pass over without a word of wonder and admiration because of some of the exploits which it includes . It is recorded that a few evenings after the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown a banquet was given by Washington and his staff to the British commander and his staff . One likes to contemplate the sportsmanship of that function . Amiabilities and good wishes were duly exchanged , and finally Lord Cornwallis rose to present his compliments to Washington . There had been much talk of past campaigning experiences , and Cornwallis , turning to Washington , expressed the judgment that when history s verdict was made up the brightest garlands for your excellency will be gathered not from the shores of the Chesapeake but from the banks of the Delaware . We may fairly assume that Cornwallis , in the fullness of a very personal experience , was qualified to judge . Washington had outgeneraled and defeated him both on the banks of the Delaware and the shores of the Chesapeake . In giving the laurels to the Trenton Princeton campaign he expressed not only his own judgment but the estimate which was afterwards pronounced by Frederick the Great , who declared that the Trenton Princeton campaign was the most brilliant military performance of the century . For myself , without pretense of military wisdom , the lightninglike stroke of Trenton and Princeton in its supreme audacity and ideal execution has always seemed the most perfectly timed combination of military genius and political wisdom that we find in the records of warfare . On the other hand , much can be urged to support the claim that Yorktown was the most brilliant campaign of Washington . With an army on the point of disintegration , he was almost utterly unable to get supplies and transport . Yet , he managed to withdraw his forces from before New York and get them well on the way to Virginia before his enemy seriously suspected his design . It was a miracle of military skill , diplomacy , and determination , to effect on the Virginia Peninsula that consolidation of forces from south and north , along with the French army and fleet , at precisely the right moment . The essence of strategy is to divide the forces of the enemy and defeat them in detail and there are few campaigns which show a commander accomplishing this through operations covering so extended a territory and involving so many difficulties . In the Yorktown campaign we sell all the varied elements of Washington s genius at work . He had to deal at once with an inert Congress that was threatening at this critical moment actually to reduce the Army . He had to find supplies and money or get along without them . In part he did one , in part the other . He had to effect a junction of widely separated forces and to maintain secrecy to the last moment . Everything must be alone within a period of time so short that it might well have made success appear utterly impossible , because he could not count on the cooperation of the French for a longer period . All these things he accomplished . Accomplishing them , he won the war , as in the campaign of Trenton and Princeton he had saved the Revolution . No man could have rendered his service to the Revolution who was not both a soldier and statesman . He understood , and he never underestimated , the political bearings of every move . When he retired to Mount Vernon , Washington entered upon a new phase of his career . He had won the war but he was a man of peace . His experience as commander in chief had completely convinced him that the form of government under the confederation could not possibly serve the necessities of the country . It is not possible here to outline the discouragements which threatened the country with all manner disasters . Washington , as the most influential citizen , was the inevitable leader in preparing for the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the establishment of a real nation . That task he took up early , and to it he devoted an energy and a wisdom that were alike amazing . It was quite natural that he should be chosen to preside over the Constitutional Convention . When its work was done , his influence was one of the chief forces to bring about ratification . After that , there was none to question that he must be the first President under the new r eacute gime . Perhaps no character in history has been subjected to more close study or sympathetic analysis than that of Washington . The volume of his writings which have been left to us is enormous . Moreover , from earliest manhood his life was lived almost continuously under intense public observation . It is therefore remarkable that biographers and eulogists should be so generally accused of failing to give us a satisfying picture of him . The fault , however , is not his , but theirs . The explanation is that no biographer has possessed , and probably none ever will possess , the full rounded measure of qualification to appreciate , to understand , to apportion , and to weigh all the elements that made this man . Unfortunately , a vast myth was early built around Washington , difficult to avoid , and not even yet entirely dissipated . Among his biographers and eulogists some have seen first and most admiringly the great soldier . Some have been most engaged with him as the statesman politician , dealing with great affairs from day to day as circumstances demanded . Others have devoted themselves particularly to portraying him as the constructive student of government , and builder of institutions . Still others have found their first inspiration in his work as a wise , firm , and discriminating administrator . Volumes have been written , and they are exceedingly interesting volumes , on Washington as a pioneer of modern scientific agriculture . It is interesting to recall that in their tastes for agriculture Washington and his great antagonist , King George IIstood on a common ground . Whoever cares to familiarize himself with this particular detail on the careers of Washington and the King will find that these two might in other circumstances have been the best of friends . For both were devoted admirers and supporters of Arthur Young , the famous English traveler and agricultural authority . In the last year or two before the beginning of the French Revolution , Young traveled extensively throughout France . He kept a journal of his observations and experiences that has since been invaluable to whoever wished to know conditions in the France of that time . Besides all this Arthur Young was almost the founder of the modern science and technique of advanced agriculture . He wrote and published voluminously on such subjects as rotation of crops , scientific fertilization , farm drainage , the breeding of livestock , the growing of plants , and many other subjects which are now commonplaces . King George became interested in his work and turned over to him some farms of the royal domain to be conducted as the earliest agricultural experiment stations . Young published an agricultural journal devoted to his theories and experiments , and to it Washington became a subscriber . This led him into a correspondence with Young , which seems to have been quite extended . Convinced that the Young program represented much of value to American agriculture , Washington offered to set aside one of his farms , to be managed by English experts , if Young would enlist them . Apparently nothing finally came of this proposal , but the act that it was made , and seriously considered , shows how near Washington and King George came to an intimate association for the betterment of agriculture . Indeed , inside of two years after the end of the Revolution Washington appealed to Young to buy and ship to him an invoice of agricultural implements and seeds with which Washington desired to experiment . On investigation , Young discovered that British law forbade these exports . So he went to the Minister for Home Affairs Lord Grenville , and pleaded for permission to send them . It was immediately granted , and by the courtesy of the British Government the entire order was filled . The incident is an interesting indication of the liberal disposition manifested , so soon after the war , by leading men of both countries . It is a pleasant thing to be privileged to recall on an occasion like this such a bit of evidence touching the underlying community of interest between the old Kingdom and the new Republic in matters of common concern and human advancement . Washington was the last person to harbor resentments and in his and other instances he more than once found his former enemies ready to meet him half way . As we look back now on a century and more of uninterrupted peace between the two nations , we can not but feel that such peace and the long period of international cooperation which it has made possible have been in no small part a testimony to the generous willingness of all men everywhere to recognize as the first citizen of the world him who has been so long acclaimed as the first American . It had been my expectations to confine my address to General Washington and leave the stately and solemn grandeur of this great figure as the sole subject for the thought of those who might hear me . I shall not enter into the vain speculation of what he might do if he were living to day . Yet his farewell address shows conclusively that he hoped to be able to lay down certain principles of conduct for his fellow countrymen which would be of advantage to them so long as the Nation into which he had wrought his life might endure . No doubt he knew the whole world would hear him . He had seen the life of the soldier in time of war and after that of the statesman in time of peace . He had an abiding faith in honesty . He believed mightily in his fellow men . The vigor with which he insisted on the prosecution of war was no less than the vigor with which he insisted on the observance of peace . He cherished no resentments , he harbored no hatreds , he forgave his enemies . He felt the same obligation to execute the terms of a treaty made for the benefit of a former foe that he felt to require the observance of those made for the benefit of his own country . He realized that peace could be the result only of mutual forbearance and mutual good faith . He harmonized the divergent and conflicting interests of different nationalities and different colonial governments by conference and agreement . He demonstrated by his arguments , and our country has demonstrated by experience , that more progress can be made by cooperation than by conflict . To agree quickly with your adversary always pays . The world has not outgrown , it can never outgrow , the absolute necessity for conformity to these eternal principles . I want to see America assume a leadership among the nations in the reliance upon the good faith of mankind . I do not see how civilization can expect permanent progress on any other theory . If what is saved in the productive peace of to day is to be lost in the destructive war of to morrow , the people of this earth can look forward to nothing but everlasting servitude . There is no justification for hope . This was not the conception which Washington had of life . If the people of the Old World are mutually distrustful of each other , let them enter into mutual covenants for their mutual security , and when such covenants have been made let them be solemnly observed no matter what he sacrifice . They have settled the far more difficult problems of reparations , they are in process of funding their debts to us why can they not agree on permanent terms of peace and fully reestablish international faith and credit If there be differences which can not be adjusted at the moment , if there be conditions which can not be foreseen , let them be resolved in the future by methods of arbitration and by the forms of judicial determination . While our own country should refrain from making political commitments where it does not have political interests , such covenants would always have the moral support of our Government and could not fail to have the commendation of the public opinion of the world . Such a course would be sure to endow the participating nations with an abundant material and spiritual reward . On what other basis can there be any encouragement for a disposition to attempt to finance a revival of Europe The world has tried war with force and has utterly failed . The only hope of success lies in peace with justice . No other principle conforms to the teaching of Washington no other standard is worthy of the spirit of America no other course makes so much promise for the regeneration of the world .<speech_sep>
