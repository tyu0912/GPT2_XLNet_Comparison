MPRESIDENT AND FELLOW CITIZENS OF NEW YORThe facts with which I shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar nor is there anything new in the general use I shall make of them . If there shall be any novelty , it will be in the mode of presenting the facts , and the inferences and observations following that presentation . In his speech last autumn , at Columbus , Ohio , as reported in The New York Times , Senator Douglas said Our fathers , when they framed the Government under which we live , understood this question just as well , and even better , than we do now . I fully indorse this , and I adopt it as a text for this discourse . I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas . It simply leaves the inquiry What was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned Our fathers , when they framed the Government under which we live , understood this question just as well , and even better , than we do now . I fully indorse this , and I adopt it as a text for this discourse . I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas . It simply leaves the inquiry What was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned What is the frame of government under which we live The answer must be The Constitution of the United States . That Constitution consists of the original , framed in 1787 , and under which the present government first went into operation , and 12 subsequently framed amendments , the first 10 of which were framed in 1789 . Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution I suppose the 39 who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present government . It is almost exactly true to say they framed it , and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time . Their names , being familiar to nearly all , and accessible to quite all , need not now be repeated . I take these 39 for the present , as being our fathers who framed the government under which we live . What is the question which , according to the text , those fathers understood just as well , and even better than we do now Upon this , Senator Douglas holds the affirmative , and Republicans the negative . This affirmation and denial form an issue and this issue this question is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood better than we . Let us now inquire whether the 39 , or any of them , ever acted upon this question and if they did , how they acted upon it how they expressed that better understanding In 1784 , three years before the Constitution the United States then owning the Northwestern Territory , and no other , the Congress of the Confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in that Territory and four of the 39 , who afterward framed the Constitution , were in that Congress , and voted on that question . Of these , Roger Sherman , Thomas Mifflin , and Hugh Williamson voted for the prohibition , thus showing that , in their understanding , no line dividing local from federal authority , nor anything else , properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory . The other of the four James Henry voted against the prohibition , showing that , for some cause , he thought it improper to vote for it . In 1787 , still before the Constitution , but while the Convention was in session framing it , and while the Northwestern Territory still was the only territory owned by the United States , the same question of prohibiting slavery in the territory again came before the Congress of the Confederation and two more of the 39 who afterward signed the Constitution , were in that Congress , and voted on the question . They were William Blount and William Few and they both voted for the prohibition thus showing that , in their understanding , no line dividing local from federal authority , nor anything else , properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory . This time the prohibition became a law , being part of what is now well known as the Ordinance of 87 . The question of federal control of slavery in the territories , seems not to have been directly before the Convention which framed the original Constitution and hence it is not recorded that the 39 , or any of them , while engaged on that instrument , expressed any opinion of that precise question . This shows that , in their understanding , no line dividing local from federal authority , nor anything in the Constitution , properly forbade Congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory else both their fidelity to correct principle , and their oath to support the Constitution , would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition . Again , George Washington , another of the 39 , was then President of the United States , and , as such , approved and signed the bill thus completing its validity as a law , and thus showing that , in his understanding , no line dividing local from federal authority , nor anything in the Constitution , forbade the federal government , to control as to slavery in federal territory . No great while after the adoption of the original Constitution , North Carolina ceded to the federal government the country now constituting the State of Tennessee and a few years later Georgia ceded that which now constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama . In both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding states that the federal government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country . Besides this , slavery was then actually in the ceded country . Under these circumstances , Congress , on taking charge of these countries , did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them . But they did interfere with it take control of it even there , to a certain extent . In 1798 , Congress organized the Territory of Mississippi . In the act of organization , they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the Territory , from any place without the United States , by fine , and giving freedom to slaves so brought . This act passed both branches of Congress without yeas and nays . In that Congress were three of the 39 who framed the original Constitution . They were John Langdon , George Read and Abraham Baldwin . They all , probably , voted for it . Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record , if , in their understanding , any line dividing local from federal authority , or anything in the Constitution , properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory . In 1803 , the federal government purchased the Louisiana country . Our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own states but this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation . In 1804 , Congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the State of Louisiana . New Orleans , lying within that part , was an old and comparatively large city . There were other considerable towns and settlements , and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people . Congress did not , in the Territorial Act , prohibit slavery but they did interfere with it take control of it in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi . The substance of the provision therein made , in relation to slaves , was This act also was passed without yeas and nays . In the Congress which passed it , there were two of the 39 . They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton . As stated in the case of Mississippi , it is probable they both voted for it . They would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it , if , in their understanding , it violated either the line properly dividing local from federal authority , or any provision of the Constitution . In 1819 20 , came and passed the Missouri question . Many votes were taken , by yeas and nays , in both branches of Congress , upon the various phases of the general question . Two of the 39 Rufus King and Charles Pinckney were members of that Congress . King steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises , while Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and against all compromises . By this , King showed that , in his understanding , no line dividing local from federal authority , nor anything in the Constitution , was violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in federal territory while Pinckney , by his votes , showed that , in his understanding , there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case . The cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the 39 , or of any of them , upon the direct issue , which I have been able to discover . To enumerate the persons who thus acted , as being four in 1784 , two in 1787 , 17 in 1789 , three in 1798 , two in 1804 , and two in 1819 20 there would be 30 of them . But this would be counting John Langdon , Roger Sherman , William Few , Rufus King , and George Read , each twice , and Abraham Baldwin , three times . The true number of those of the 39 whom I have shown to have acted upon the question , which , by the text , they understood better than we , is 23 , leaving 16 not shown to have acted upon it in any way . Here , then , we have 23 out of our 39 fathers who framed the government under which we live , who have , upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths , acted upon the very question which the text affirms they understood just as well , and even better than we do now and 21 of them a clear majority of the whole 39 so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury , if , in their understanding , any proper division between local and federal authority , or anything in the Constitution they had made themselves , and sworn to support , forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories . Thus the 21 acted and , as actions speak louder than words , so actions , under such responsibility , speak still louder . Two of the 23 voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories , in the instances in which they acted upon the question . But for what reasons they so voted is not known . They may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from federal authority , or some provision or principle of the Constitution , stood in the way or they may , without any such question , have voted against the prohibition , on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency . No one who has sworn to support the Constitution , can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure , however expedient he may think it but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional , if , at the same time , he deems it inexpedient . It , therefore , would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition , as having done so because , in their understanding , any proper division of local from federal authority , or anything in the Constitution , forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory . The remaining 16 of the 39 , so far as I have discovered , have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territories . But there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their 23 compeers , had it been manifested at all . For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text , I have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person , however distinguished , other than the 39 fathers who framed the original Constitution and , for the same reason , I have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the 39 even , on any other phase of the general question of slavery . If we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases , as the foreign slave trade , and the morality and policy of slavery generally , it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories , the 16 , if they had acted at all , would probably have acted just as the 23 did . Among that 16 were several of the most noted anti slavery men of those times as Franklin , Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris while there was not one now known to have been otherwise , unless it may be John Rutledge , of South Carolina . The sum of the whole is , that of our 39 fathers who framed the original Constitution , 21 a clear majority of the whole certainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority , nor any part of the Constitution , forbade the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories while all the rest probably had the same understanding . Such , unquestionably , was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution and the text affirms that they understood the question better than we . But , so far , I have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original Constitution . In and by the original instrument , a mode was provided for amending it and , as I have already stated , the present frame of the government under which we live consists of that original , and 12 amendatory articles framed and adopted since . Those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the Constitution , point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates and , as I understand , they all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles , and not in the original instrument . The Supreme Court , in the Dred Scott case , plant themselves upon the fifth amendment , which provides that no person shall be deprived of life , liberty or property without due process of law while Senator Douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment , providing that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . Now , it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution the identical Congress which passed the act already mentioned , enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory . Not only was it the same Congress , but they were the identical , same individual men who , at the same session , and at the same time within the session , had under consideration , and in progress toward maturity , these Constitutional amendments , and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned . The Constitutional amendments were introduced before , and passed after the act enforcing the Ordinance of 87 so that , during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the Ordinance , the Constitutional amendments were also pending . The 76 members of that Congress , including 16 of the framers of the original Constitution , as before stated , were preeminently our fathers who framed that part of the government under which we live , which is now claimed as forbidding the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories . Is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that Congress deliberately framed , and carried to maturity at the same time , are absolutely inconsistent with each other And does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth , that those who did the two things , alleged to be inconsistent , understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent It is surely safe to assume that the 39 framers of the original Constitution , and the 76 members of the Congress which framed the amendments thereto , taken together , do certainly include those who may be fairly called our fathers who framed the government under which we live . And so assuming , I defy any man to show that any one of them ever , in his whole life , declared that , in his understanding , any proper division of local from federal authority , or any part of the Constitution , forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories . I go a step further . I defy any one to show that any living man in the whole world ever did , prior to the beginning of the present century , and I might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century , declare that , in his understanding , any proper division of local from federal authority , or any part of the Constitution , forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories . To those who now so declare , I give , not only our fathers who framed the government under which we live , but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed , among whom to search , and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them . Now , and here , let me guard a little against being misunderstood . I do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did . To do so , would be to discard all the lights of current experience to reject all progress all improvement . What I do say is , that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case , we should do so upon evidence so conclusive , and argument so clear , that even their great authority , fairly considered and weighed , cannot stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we . If any man at this day sincerely believes that a proper division of local from federal authority , or any part of the Constitution , forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories , he is right to say so , and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can . But he has no right to mislead others , who have less access to history , and less leisure to study it , into the false belief that our fathers , who framed the government under which we live , were of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument . If any man at this day sincerely believes our fathers who framed the government under which we live , used and applied principles , in other cases , which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the Constitution , forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories , he is right to say so . But he should , at the same time , brave the responsibility of declaring that , in his opinion , he understands their principles better than they did themselves and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they understood the question just as well , and even better , than we do now . And now , if they would listen as I suppose they will not I would address a few words to the Southern people . I would say to them You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people . Still , when you speak of us Republicans , you do so only to denounce us as reptiles , or , at the best , as no better than outlaws . You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers , but nothing like it to Black Republicans . In all your contentions with one another , each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of Black Republicanism as the first thing to be attended to . Indeed , such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite license , so to speak among you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all . Now , can you , or not , be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us , or even to yourselves Bring forward your charges and specifications , and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify . You say we are sectional . We deny it . That makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you . You produce your proof and what is it Why , that our party has no existence in your section gets no votes in your section . The fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue If it does , then in case we should , without change of principle , begin to get votes in your section , we should thereby cease to be sectional . You cannot escape this conclusion and yet , are you willing to abide by it If you are , you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional , for we shall get votes in your section this very year . You will then begin to discover , as the truth plainly is , that your proof does not touch the issue . The fact that we get no votes in your section , is a fact of your making , and not of ours . And if there be fault in that fact , that fault is primarily yours , and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice . If we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice , the fault is ours but this brings you to where you ought to have started to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle . If our principle , put in practice , would wrong your section for the benefit of ours , or for any other object , then our principle , and we with it , are sectional , and are justly opposed and denounced as such . Meet us , then , on the question of whether our principle , put in practice , would wrong your section and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said on our side . Do you accept the challenge No Then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it , and indorse it again and again , upon their official oaths , is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment s consideration . Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his Farewell Address . Less than eight years before Washington gave that warning , he had , as President of the United States , approved and signed an act of Congress , enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory , which act embodied the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it , he wrote La Fayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure , expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states . Bearing this in mind , and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject , is that warning a weapon in your hands against us , or in our hands against you Could Washington himself speak , would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us , who sustain his policy , or upon you who repudiate it We respect that warning of Washington , and we commend it to you , together with his example pointing to the right application of it . But you say you are conservative eminently conservative while we are revolutionary , destructive , or something of the sort . What is conservatism Is it not adherence to the old and tried , against the new and untried We stick to , contend for , the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject , and scout , and spit upon that old policy , and insist upon substituting something new . True , you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be . You are divided on new propositions and plans , but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers . Some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade some for a Congressional Slave Code for the Territories some for Congress forbidding the Territories to prohibit Slavery within their limits some for maintaining Slavery in the Territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another , no third man should object , fantastically called Popular Sovereignty but never a man among you in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories , according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live . Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated . Consider , then , whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves , and your charge of destructiveness against us , are based on the most clear and stable foundations . Again , you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was . We deny it . We admit that it is more prominent , but we deny that we made it so . It was not we , but you , who discarded the old policy of the fathers . We resisted , and still resist , your innovation and thence comes the greater prominence of the question . Would you have that question reduced to its former proportions Go back to that old policy . What has been will be again , under the same conditions . If you would have the peace of the old times , readopt the precepts and policy of the old times . You charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves . We deny it and what is your proof Harper s Ferry John Brown John Brown was no Republican and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his Harper s Ferry enterprise . If any member of our party is guilty in that matter , you know it or you do not know it . If you do know it , you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact . If you do not know it , you are inexcusable for asserting it , and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof . You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true , is simply malicious slander . Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper s Ferry affair but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results . We do not believe it . We know we hold to no doctrine , and make no declaration , which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government under which we live . You never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair . When it occurred , some important state elections were near at hand , and you were in evident glee with the belief that , by charging the blame upon us , you could get an advantage of us in those elections . The elections came , and your expectations were not quite fulfilled . Every Republican man knew that , as to himself at least , your charge was a slander , and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor . Republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves , or with you about your slaves . Surely , this does not encourage them to revolt . True , we do , in common with our fathers , who framed the government under which we live , declare our belief that slavery is wrong but the slaves do not hear us declare even this . For anything we say or do , the slaves would scarcely know there is a Republican party . I believe they would not , in fact , generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us , in their hearing . In your political contests among yourselves , each faction charges the other with sympathy with Black Republicanism and then , to give point to the charge , defines Black Republicanism to simply be insurrection , blood and thunder among the slaves . Jefferson did not mean to say , nor do that the power of emancipation is in the federal government . He spoke of Virginia and , as to the power of emancipation , I speak of the slaveholding states only . The federal government , however , as we insist , has the power of restraining the extension of the institution the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now free from slavery . John Brown s effort was peculiar . It was not a slave insurrection . It was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves , in which the slaves refused to participate . In fact , it was so absurd that the slaves , with all their ignorance , saw plainly enough it could not succeed . That affair , in its philosophy , corresponds with the many attempts , related in history , at the assassination of kings and emperors . An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them . He ventures the attempt , which ends in little else than his own execution . Orsini s attempt on Louis Napoleon , and John Brown s attempt at Harper s Ferry were , in their philosophy , precisely the same . The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case , and on New England in the other , does not disprove the sameness of the two things . And how much would it avail you , if you could , by the use of John Brown , Helper s Book , and the like , break up the Republican organization Human action can be modified to some extent , but human nature cannot be changed . There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation , which cast at least a million and a half of votes . You cannot destroy that judgment and feeling that sentiment by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it . You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire but if you could , how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot box , into some other channel What would that other channel probably be Would the number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation But you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your Constitutional rights . That has a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliated , if not fully justified , were we proposing , by the mere force of numbers , to deprive you of some right , plainly written down in the Constitution . But we are proposing no such thing . When you make these declarations , you have a specific and well understood allusion to an assumed Constitutional right of yours , to take slaves into the federal territories , and to hold them there as property . But no such right is specifically written in the Constitution . That instrument is literally silent about any such right . We , on the contrary , deny that such a right has any existence in the Constitution , even by implication . Your purpose , then , plainly stated , is , that you will destroy the government , unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please , on all points in dispute between you and us . You will rule or ruin in all events . This , plainly stated , is your language . Perhaps you will say the Supreme Court has decided the disputed Constitutional question in your favor . Not quite so . But waiving the lawyer s distinction between dictum and decision , the Court have decided the question for you in a sort of way . The Court have substantially said , it is your Constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories , and to hold them there as property . When I say the decision was made in a sort of way , I mean it was made in a divided Court , by a bare majority of the judges , and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning , and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact the statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution . To show all this , is easy and certain . When this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice , is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement , and reconsider the conclusion based upon it And then it is to be remembered that our fathers , who framed the government under which we live the men who made the Constitution decided this same Constitutional question in our favor , long ago decided it without division among themselves , when making the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made , and , so far as any evidence is left , without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts . Under all these circumstances , do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this government , unless such a court decision as yours is , shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action But you will not abide the election of a Republican President In that supposed event , you say , you will destroy the Union and then , you say , the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us That is cool . A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear , and mutters through his teeth , Stand and deliver , or I shall kill you , and then you will be a murderer To be sure , what the robber demanded of me my money was my own and I had a clear right to keep it but it was no more my own than my vote is my own and the threat of death to me , to extort my money , and the threat of destruction to the Union , to extort my vote , can scarcely be distinguished in principle . Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them We know they will not . In all their present complaints against us , the Territories are scarcely mentioned . Invasions and insurrections are the rage now . Will it satisfy them , if , in the future , we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections We know it will not . We so know , because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation . The question recurs , what will satisfy them Simply this We must not only let them alone , but we must , somehow , convince them that we do let them alone . This , we know by experience , is no easy task . We have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization , but with no success . In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone but this has had no tendency to convince them . Alike unavailing to convince them , is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them . Wrong as we think slavery is , we can yet afford to let it alone where it is , because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we , while our votes will prevent it , allow it to spread into the National Territories , and to overrun us here in these Free States If our sense of duty forbids this , then let us stand by our duty , fearlessly and effectively . Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong , vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of do not care on a question about which all true men do care such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists , reversing the divine rule , and calling , not the sinners , but the righteous to repentance such as invocations to Washington , imploring men to unsay what Washington said , and undo what Washington did . Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us , nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government nor of dungeons to ourselves . LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHAND IN THAT FAITLET UTO THE ENDARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to Almighty God . The condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory . Mexico continues to be a theater of civil war . While our political relations with that country have undergone no change , we have at the same time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents . At the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua , a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and the port of San Juan . It is a source of much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably adjusted , and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation . We could not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great improvement . It would be doing injustice to an important South American State not to acknowledge the directness , frankness , and cordiality with which the United States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with this Government . A claims convention has been constituted to complete the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861 . The new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people , the Government under it has been recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and friendly spirit . The long deferred Aves Island claim has been satisfactorily paid and discharged . Mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint commission for the settlement of claims between the United States and Peru . An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two countries , and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain . Our relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile , the Argentine Republic , Bolivia , Costa Rica , Paraguay , San Salvador , and Hayti . During the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of those Republics , and , on the other hand , their sympathies with the United States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness . The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian in 1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile . Civil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo , apparently without prospect of an early close . Official correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia , and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that Republic . It may be expected to derive new vigor from American influence , improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the United States . I solicit your authority to furnish to the Republic a gunboat at moderate cost , to be reimbursed to the United States by installments . Such a vessel is needed for the safety of that State against the native African races , and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands . The possession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the Republic , and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations . The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe , by the way of Behrings Straits and Asiatic Russia , which was sanctioned by Congress at the last session , has been undertaken , under very favorable circumstances , by an association of American citizens , with the cordial good will and support as well of this Government as of those of Great Britain and Russia . Assurances have been received from most of the South American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to cooperate in constructing lines tributary to that world encircling communication . I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has been renewed , with full expectation of its early accomplishment . Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization . Our very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April last . An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a suspension of intercourse . The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate , and our relations with Egypt , as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers , are entirely satisfactory . The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been suppressed , with the cooperating good offices of this Government and of the other Western commercial States . The judicial consular establishment there has become very difficult and onerous , and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government and people of that vast Empire . China seems to be accepting with hearty good will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the Western nations . Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its Government , the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious . Nevertheless , good progress has been effected by the Western powers , moving with enlightened concert . Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement , and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce . There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan toward the United States . The ports of Norfolk , Fernandina , and Pensacola have been opened by proclamation . It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves , as well as just to the United States , to resort to these and other open ports than it is to pursue , through many hazards and at vast cost , a contraband trade with other ports which are closed , if not by actual military occupation , at least by a lawful and effective blockade . For myself , I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive , under the law of nations , to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the United States . If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law , or ought to be further regulated by it , I recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country . It is possible that if it were new and open question the maritime powers , with the lights they now enjoy , would not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States , destitute , as they are , and always have been , equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors . Disloyal emissaries have been neither less assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts under favor of that privilege , to embroil our country in foreign wars . The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own . Nevertheless , unforeseen political difficulties have arisen , especially in Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary of the United States , which have required , and are likely to continue to require , the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States , as well as of the nations concerned and their governments . Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain on the adjustment of the claims of the Hudsons Bay and Pugets Sound Agricultural Companies , in Oregon , and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them . In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the Canadian border , by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there , it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months , the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with Great Britain , the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that proceeding necessary . The condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States , as well as the regulation of imposts , which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June , 1854 . I desire , however , to be understood while making this statement that the colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the United States , but , on the contrary , there is every reason to expect that , with the approval of the Imperial Government , they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border . The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration has so far as was possible been put into operation . It seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports , so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement . A liberal disposition toward this great national policy is manifested by most of the European States , and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective national protection . I regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health . All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness , and to that end the Government must in every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country . The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully administered during the last year . The legislation of the last session of Congress has beneficially affected the revenues , although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation . The receipts during the year from all sources , upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury , including loans and the balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July , 1863 , were 1 , 394 , 796 , 007 . 62 , and the aggregate disbursements , upon the same basis , were 1 , 298 , 056 , 101 . 89 , leaving a balance in the Treasury , as shown by warrants , of 96 , 739 , 905 . 73 . Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor , and the actual cash operations of the Treasury were Receipts , 884 , 076 , 646 . 57 disbursements , 865 , 234 , 087 . 86 which leaves a cash balance in the Treasury of 18 , 842 , 558 . 71 . Of the receipts there were derived from customs 102 , 316 , 152 . 99 , from lands 588 , 333 . 29 . from direct taxes 475 , 648 . 96 , from internal revenue 109 , 741 , 134 . 10 , from miscellaneous sources 47 , 511 , 448 . 10 , and from loans applied to actual expenditures , including former balance , 623 , 443 , 929 . 13 . There were disbursed for the civil service 27 , 505 , 599 . 46 , for pensions and Indians 7 , 517 , 930 . 97 , for the War Department 690 , 791 , 842 . 97 , for the Navy Department 85 , 733 , 292 . 77 , for interest on the public debt 53 , 685 , 421 . 69 , making an aggregate of 865 , 234 , 087 . 86 and leaving a balance in the Treasury of 18 , 842 , 558 . 71 , as before stated . For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year , and the general operations of the Treasury in detail , I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury . I concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased and I earnestly invite your attention to this subject , to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the Secretary . The public debt on the 1st day of July last , as appears by the books of the Treasury , amounted to 1 , 740 , 690 , 489 . 49 . Probably , should the war continue for another year , that amount may be increased by not far from five hundred millions . Held , as it is , for the most part by our own people , it has become a substantial branch of national , though private , property . For obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among all the people the better . To favor such general distribution , greater inducements to become owners might , perhaps , with good effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited means . With this view I suggest whether it might not be both competent and expedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt , under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege . This would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want . Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might be able to save enough for the purpose . The great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious . Men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves . The public debt on the 1st day of July last , although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the commencement of the last session , falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the preceding December as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of 3 , 995 , 097 . 31 . This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury . The national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people . On the 25th day of November 584 national banks had been organized , a considerable number of which were conversions from State banks . Changes from State systems to the national system are rapidly taking place , and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress and no bank note circulation not secured by the Government . That the Government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned . The national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of paper money . Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of State bank issues it will be for Congress to determine . It seems quite clear that the Treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted unless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the bank note circulation of the country . The report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message , and also the operations of the several administrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year . It will also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force . The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval service . It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success . The general exhibit of the Navy , including vessels under construction on the 1st of December , 1864 , shows a total of 671 vessels , carrying 4 , 610 guns , and of 510 , 396 tons , being an actual increase during the year , over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle , of 83 vessels , 167 guns , and 42 , 427 tons . The total number of men at this time in the naval service , including officers , is about 51 , 000 . There have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels , and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1 , 379 , of which 267 are steamers . The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus far reported amount to 14 , 396 , 250 . 51 . A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported . The total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description , including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the 4th of March , 1861 , to the 1st of November , 1864 , is 238 , 647 , 262 . 35 . Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy , especially in regard to a navy yard and suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery and armature for our ships , to which reference was made in my last annual message . Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in relation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect to prize on our inland waters . I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of vice admiral in our naval service . Your attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster General for a detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the Post Office Department . The postal revenues for the year ending June 30 , 1864 , amounted to 12 , 438 , 253 . 78 and the expenditures to 12 , 644 , 786 . 20 , the excess of expenditures over receipts being 206 , 652 . 42 . The views presented by the Postmaster General on the subject of special grants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries should receive the careful consideration of Congress . It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population , improvement , and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked , much less impeded or destroyed , by our great civil war , which at first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation . The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed in conformity with law , and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountains , which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean . The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth . Idaho and Montana , by reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities , have been only partially organized but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear , which will permit their governments , like those of the others , to go into speedy and full operation . As intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the nation , I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands , Indian affairs , the Pacific Railroad , and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith transmitted , and which report also embraces the subjects of patents , pensions , and other topics of public interest pertaining to his Department . The quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on the 30th of September last was 4 , 221 , 342 acres , of which 1 , 538 , 614 acres were entered under the homestead law . The remainder was located with military land warrants , agricultural scrip certified to States for railroads , and sold for cash . The cash received from sales and location fees was 1 , 019 , 446 . The income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1864 , was 678 , 007 . 21 , against 136 , 077 . 95 received during the preceding year . The aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of , and there is open to settlement about 133 , 000 , 000 acres of surveyed land . The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States by railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success , notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor . The route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for 100 miles westward from the initial point at Omaha City , Nebr . , and a preliminary location of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento eastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada . Numerous discoveries of gold , silver , and cinnabar mines have been added to the many heretofore known , and the country occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with enterprising labor , which is richly remunerative . It is believed that the product of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year reached , if not exceeded , one hundred millions in value . It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be remodeled . Congress at its last session , acting upon the recommendation , did provide for reorganizing the system in California , and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the Indians there will be attended with reasonable success . Much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the country , to render it secure for the advancing set tier , and to provide for the welfare of the Indian . The Secretary reiterates his recommendations , and to them the attention of Congress is invited . The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows , orphans , and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease contracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been diligently administered . There have been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of 16 , 770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen , making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22 , 767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712 . Of widows , orphans , and mothers 22 , 198 have been placed on the army pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls . The present number of army pensioners of this class is 25 , 433 and of navy pensioners 793 . At the beginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1 , 430 . Only 12 of them were soldiers , of whom 7 have since died . The remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to Revolutionary soldiers . During the year ending the 30th of June , 1864 , 4 , 504 , 616 . 92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes . I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent institutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been established or fostered by Congress , and respectfully refer for information concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct , the Capitol , and other matters of local interest to the report of the Secretary . The Agricultural Department , under the supervision of its present energetic and faithful head , is rapidly commending itself to the great and vital interest it was created to advance It is peculiarly the people s Department , in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other . I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress . The war continues . Since the last annual message all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our arms have steadily advanced , thus liberating the regions left in rear , so that Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , and parts of other States have again produced reasonably fair crops . The most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is General Sherman s attempted march of 300 miles directly through the insurgent region . It tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our General in Chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy , and yet to detach a well appointed large army to move on such an expedition . The result not yet being known , conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged . Important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of molding society for durability in the Union . Although short of complete success , it is much in the fight direction that 12 , 000 citizens in each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State governments , with free constitutions , and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them . The movements in the same direction , more extensive though less definite , in Missouri , Kentucky , and Tennessee should not be overlooked . But Maryland presents the example of complete success . Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future . The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland . Like another foul spirit being driven out , it may seek to tear her , but it will woo her no more . At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the Senate , but failed for lack of the requisite two thirds vote in the House of Representatives . Although the present is the same Congress and nearly the same members , and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition , I venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session . Of course the abstract question is not changed but in intervening election shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass the measure if this does not . Hence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action . And as it is to so go at all events , may we not agree that the sooner the better It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their votes any further than , as an additional element to be considered , their judgment may be affected by it . It is the voice of the people now for the first time heard upon the question . In a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable almost indispensable . And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply because it is the will of the majority . In this case the common end is the maintenance of the Union , and among the means to secure that end such will , through the election , is most dearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment . The most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections . Judging by the recent canvass and its result , the purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now . The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this . Not only all those who supported the Union ticket , so called , but a great majority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose . It is an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any officce whatever , high or low , has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union . There have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union cause , but on the distinct issue of Union or no Union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people . In affording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this firmess and unanimity of purpose , the election has been of vast value to the national cause . The election has exhibited another tact not less valuable to be known the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resources , that of living men . While it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many hearts , it is some relief to know that , compared with the surviving , the fallen have been so few . While corps and divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence , a great majority of the men who composed them are still living . The same is true of the naval service . The election returns prove this . So many voters could not else be found . The States regularly holding elections , both now and four years ago , to wit , California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Missouri , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , West Virginia , and Wisconsin , east 3 , 982 , 011 votes now , against 3 , 870 , 222 cast then , showing an aggregate now of 3 , 982 , 011 . To this is to be added 33 , 762 cast now in the new States of Kansas and Nevada , which States did not vote in 1860 , thus swelling the aggregate to 4 , 015 , 773 and the net increase during the three years and a half of war to 145 , 551 . A table is appended showing particulars . To this again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from Massachusetts , Rhode Island , New Jersey , Delaware , Indiana , Illinois , and California , who by the laws of those States could not vote away from their homes , and which number can not be less than 90 , 000 . Nor yet is this all . The number in organized Territories is triple now what it was four years ago , while thousands , white and black , join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines . So much is shown , affirmatively and negatively , by the election . It is not material to inquire how the increase has been produced or to show that it would have been greater but for the war , which is probably true . The important fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than we had when the war began that we are not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion that we are gaining strength and may if need be maintain the contest indefinitely . This as to men . Material resources are now more complete and abundant than ever . The national resources , then , are unexhausted , and , as we believe , inexhaustible . The public purpose to reestablish and maintain the national authority is unchanged , and , as we believe , unchangeable . The manner of continuing the effort remains to choose . On careful consideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good . He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union , precisely what we will not and can not give . His declarations to this effect are explicit and oft repeated . He does not attempt to deceive us . He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves . He can not voluntarily reaccept the Union we can not voluntarily yield it . Between him and us the issue is distinct , simple , and inflexible . It is an issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory . If we yield , we are beaten if the Southern people fail him , he is beaten . Either way it would be the victory and defeat following war . What is true , however , of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow . Although he can not reaccept the Union , they can . Some of them , we know , already desire peace and reunion . The number of such may increase . They can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the Constitution . Alter so much the Government could not , if it would , maintain war against them . The loyal people would not sustain or allow it . If questions should remain , we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation , conference , courts , and votes , operating only in constitutional and lawful channels . Some certain , and other possible , questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to adjust as , for instance , the admission of members into Congress and whatever might require the appropriation of money . The Executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war . Pardons and remissions of forfeitures , however , would still be within Executive control . In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past . A year ago general pardon and amnesty , upon specified terms , were offered to all except certain designated classes , and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency . During the year many availed themselves of the general provision , and many more would , only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain . During the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes , and no voluntary application has been denied . Thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice that is , such as were in custody or under constraint . It is still so open to all . But the time may come , probably will come , when public duty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted . In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government , I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery . I repeat the declaration made a year a ago , that while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation , nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress . If the people should , by whatever mode or means , make it an Executive duty to reenslave such persons , another , and not must be their instrument to perform it . In stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it .<speech_sep>PRESIDENT and Gentlemen of the Convention . If we could first know where we are , and whither we are tending , we could then better judge what to do , and how to do it . We are now far into the fifth year , since a policy was initiated , with the avowed object , and confident promise , of putting an end to slavery agitation . Under the operation of that policy , that agitation has not only , not ceased , but has constantly augmented . In my opinion , it will not cease , until a crisis shall have been reached and passed . A house divided against itself cannot stand . I believe this government cannot endure , permanently half slave and half free . I do not expect the Union to be dissolved I do not expect the house to fall but I do expect it will cease to be divided . It will become all one thing , or all the other . Either the opponents of slavery , will arrest the further spread of it , and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward , till it shall become alike lawful in all the States , old as well as new North as well as South . Have we no tendency to the latter condition Let any one who doubts , carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination piece of machinery so to speak compounded of the Nebraska doctrine , and the Dred Scott decision . Let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do , and how well adapted but also , let him study the history of its construction , and trace , if he can , or rather fail , if he can , to trace the evidences of design , and concert of action , among its chief bosses , from the beginning . But , so far , Congress only , had acted and an indorsement by the people , real or apparent , was indispensable , to save the point already gained , and give chance for more . The new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the States by State Constitutions , and from most of the national territory by Congressional prohibition . Four days later , commenced the struggle , which ended in repealing that Congressional prohibition . This opened all the national territory to slavery , and was the first point gained . This necessity had not been overlooked but had been provided for , as well as might be , in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty , otherwise called sacred right of self government , which latter phrase , though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government , was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this That if any one man , choose to enslave another , no third man shall be allowed to object . That argument was incorporated into the Nebraska bill itself , in the language which follows It being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or state , not exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way , subject only to the Constitution of the United States . Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of Squatter Sovereignty , and Sacred right of self government . But , said opposition members , let us be more specific let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery . Not we , said the friends of the measure and down they voted the amendment . While the Nebraska bill was passing through congress , a law case , involving the question of a negroe s freedom , by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free state and then a territory covered by the congressional prohibition , and held him as a slave , for a long time in each , was passing through the Circuit Court for the District of Missouri and both Nebraska bill and law suit were brought to a decision in the same month of May , 1854 . The negroe s name was Dred Scott , which name now designates the decision finally made in the case . Before the then next Presidential election , the law case came to , and was argued in the Supreme Court of the United States but the decision of it was deferred until after the election . Still , before the election , Senator Trumbull , on the floor of the Senate , requests the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits and the latter answers , That is a question for the Supreme Court . The election came . Buchanan was elected , and the indorsement , such as it was , secured . That was the second point gained . The indorsement , however , fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes , and so , perhaps , was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory . The outgoing President , in his last annual message , as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement . The Supreme Court met again did not announce their decision , but ordered a re argument . The Presidential inauguration came , and still no decision of the court but the incoming President , in his inaugural address , fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision , whatever it might be . Then , in a few days , came the decision . The reputed author of the Nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capitol indorsing the Dred Scott Decision , and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it . The new President , too , seizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision , and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained . At length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of the Nebraska bill , on the mere question of fact , whether the Lecompton constitution was or was not , in any just sense , made by the people of Kansas and in that squabble the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people , and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up . I do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up , to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind the principle for which he declares he has suffered much , and is ready to suffer to the end . And well may he cling to that principle . If he has any parental feeling , well may he cling to it . That principle , is the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine . Under the Dred Scott decision , squatter sovereignty squatted out of existence , tumbled down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry served through one blast and fell back into loose sand helped to carry an election , and then was kicked to the winds . His late joint struggle with the Republicans , against the Lecompton Constitution , involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine . That struggle was made on a point , the right of a people to make their own constitution , upon which he and the Republicans have never differed . The several points of the Dred Scott decision , in connection with Senator Douglas care not policy , constitute the piece of machinery , in its present state of advancement . This was the third point gained . The working points of that machinery are First , that no negro slave , imported as such from Africa , and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen of any State , in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States . This point is made in order to deprive the negro , in every possible event , of the benefit of this provision of the United States Constitution , which declares that The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States . Secondly , that subject to the Constitution of the United States , neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can exclude slavery from any United States territory . This point is made in order that individual men may fill up the territories with slaves , without danger of losing them as property , and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future . Thirdly , that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free State , makes him free , as against the holder , the United States courts will not decide , but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be forced into by the master . This point is made , not to be pressed immediately but , if acquiesced in for a while , and apparently indorsed by the people at an election , then to sustain the logical conclusion that what Dred Scott s master might lawfully do with Dred Scott , in the free State of Illinois , every other master may lawfully do with any other one , or one thousand slaves , in Illinois , or in any other free State . Auxiliary to all this , and working hand in hand with it , the Nebraska doctrine , or what is left of it , is to educate and mould public opinion , at least Northern public opinion , to not care whether slavery is voted down or voted up . This shows exactly where we now are and partially also , whither we are tending . It will throw additional light on the latter , to go back , and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated . Several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring . The people were to be left perfectly free subject only to the Constitution . What the Constitution had to do with it , outsiders could not then see . Plainly enough now , it was an exactly fitted niche , for the Dred Scott decision to afterwards come in , and declare the perfect freedom of the people , to be just no freedom at all . Why was the amendment , expressly declaring the right of the people to exclude slavery , voted down Plainly enough now , the adoption of it , would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision . Why was the court decision held up Why , even a Senator s individual opinion withheld , till after the Presidential election Plainly enough now , the speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried . Why the outgoing President s felicitation on the indorsement Why the delay of a reargument Why the incoming President s advance exhortation in favor of the decision These things look like the cautious patting and petting a spirited horse , preparatory to mounting him , when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall . And why the hasty after indorsements of the decision by the President and others We can not absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert . But when we see a lot of framed timbers , different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmen Stephen , Franklin , Roger and James , for instance and when we see these timbers joined together , and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill , all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting , and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places , and not a piece too many or too few not omitting even scaffolding or , if a single piece be lacking , we can see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared to yet bring such piece in in such a case , we find it impossible to not believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning , and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first lick was struck . It should not be overlooked that , by the Nebraska bill , the people of a State as well as Territory , were to be left perfectly free subject only to the Constitution . Why mention a State They were legislating for territories , and not for or about States . Certainly the people of a State are and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United States but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial law Why are the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lumped together , and their relation to the Constitution therein treated as being precisely the same While the opinion of the Court , by Chief Justice Taney , in the Dred Scott case , and the separate opinions of all the concurring Judges , expressly declare that the Constitution of the United States neither permits Congress nor a Territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any United States territory , they all omit to declare whether or not the same Constitution permits a state , or the people of a State , to exclude it . Possibly , this was a mere omission but who can be quite sure , if McLean or Curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from their limits , just as Chase and Macy sought to get such declaration , in behalf of the people of a territory , into the Nebraska bill I ask , who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down , in the one case , as it had been in the other . The nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a State over slavery , is made by Judge Nelson . He approaches it more than once , using the precise idea , and almost the language too , of the Nebraska act . On one occasion his exact language is , except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States , the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction . In what cases the power of the states is so restrained by the Constitution , is left an open question , precisely as the same question , as to the restraint on the power of the territories was left open in the Nebraska act . Put that and that together , and we have another nice little niche , which we may , ere long , see filled with another Supreme Court decision , declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its limits . And this may especially be expected if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up , shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made . Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the States . Welcome or unwelcome , such decision is probably coming , and will soon be upon us , unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown . We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their State free and we shall awake to the reality , instead , that the Supreme Court has made Illinois a slave State . To meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty , is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation . That is what we have to do . But how can we best do it There are those who denounce us openly to their own friends , and yet whisper us softly , that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there is , with which to effect that object . They do not tell us , nor has he told us , that he wishes any such object to be effected . They wish us to infer all , from the facts , that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty and that he has regularly voted with us , on a single point , upon which , he and we , have never differed . They remind us that he is a very great man , and that the largest of us are very small ones . Let this be granted . But a living dog is better than a dead lion . Judge Douglas , if not a dead lion for this work , is at least a caged and toothless one . How can he oppose the advances of slavery He do not care anything about it . His avowed mission is impressing the public heart to care nothing about it . A leading Douglas Democratic newspaper thinks Douglas superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the African slave trade . Does Douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching He has not said so . Does he really think so But if it is , how can he resist it For years he has labored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new territories . Can he possibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest And , unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia . He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property and as such , how can he oppose the foreign slave trade how can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free unless he does it as a protection to the home production And as the home producers will probably not ask the protection , he will be wholly without a ground of opposition . Senator Douglas holds , we know , that a man may rightfully be wiser to day than he was yesterday that he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong . But , can we for that reason , run ahead , and infer that he will make any particular change , of which he , himself , has given no intimation Can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference Now , as ever , I wish to not misrepresent Judge Douglas position , question his motives , or do ought that can be personally offensive to him . Whenever , if ever , he and we can come together on principle so that our great cause may have assistance from his great ability , I hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacle . But clearly , he is not now with us he does not pretend to be he does not promise to ever be . Our cause , then , must be intrusted to , and conducted by its own undoubted friends those whose hands are free , whose hearts are in the work who do care for the result . Two years ago the Republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong . We did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger , with every external circumstance against us . Of strange , discordant , and even , hostile elements , we gathered from the four winds , and formed and fought the battle through , under the constant hot fire of a disciplined , proud , and pampered enemy . Did we brave all then , to falter now now when that same enemy is wavering , dissevered and belligerent The result is not doubtful . We shall not fail if we stand firm , we shall not fail . Wise councils may accelerate or mistakes delay it , but , sooner or later the victory is sure to come .<speech_sep>The repeal of the Missouri Compromise , and the propriety of its restoration , constitute the subject of what I am about to say . As I desire to present my own connected view of this subject , my remarks will not be , specifically , an answer to Judge Douglas yet , as I proceed , the main points he has presented will arise , and will receive such respectful attention as I may be able to give them . I wish further to say , that I do not propose to question the patriotism , or to assail the motives of any man , or class of men but rather to strictly confine myself to the naked merits of the question . I also wish to be no less than National in all the positions I may take and whenever I take ground which others have thought , or may think , narrow , sectional and dangerous to the Union , I hope to give a reason , which will appear sufficient , at least to some , why I think differently . And , as this subject is no other , than part and parcel of the larger general question of domestic slavery , I wish to MAKE and to KEEP the distinction between the EXISTING institution , and the EXTENSION of it , so broad , and so clear , that no honest man can misunderstand me , and no dishonest one , successfully misrepresent me . In order to a clear understanding of what the Missouri Compromise is , a short history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper . When we established our independence , we did not own , or claim , the country to which this compromise applies . Indeed , strictly speaking , the confederacy then owned no country at all the States respectively owned the country within their limits and some of them owned territory beyond their strict State limits . Virginia thus owned the North Western territory the country out of which the principal part of Ohio , all Indiana , all Illinois , all Michigan and all Wisconsin , have since been formed . She also owned perhaps within her then limits what has since been formed into the State of Kentucky . North Carolina thus owned what is now the State of Tennessee and South Carolina and Georgia , in separate parts , owned what are now Mississippi and Alabama . Connecticut , I think , owned the little remaining part of Ohio being the same where they now send Giddings to Congress , and beat all creation at making cheese . These territories , together with the States themselves , constituted all the country over which the confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction . We were then living under the Articles of Confederation , which were superceded by the Constitution several years afterwards . The question of ceding these territories to the general government was set on foot . Jefferson , the author of the Declaration of Independence , and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in Congress afterwards twice President who was , is , and perhaps will continue to be , the most distinguished politician of our history a Virginian by birth and continued residence , and withal , a slave holder conceived the idea of taking that occasion , to prevent slavery ever going into the north western territory . He prevailed on the Virginia Legislature to adopt his views , and to cede the territory , making the prohibition of slavery therein , a condition of the deed . Congress accepted the cession , with the condition and in the first Ordinance which the acts of Congress were then called for the government of the territory , provided that slavery should never be permitted therein . This is the famed ordinance of 87 so often spoken of . Thenceforward , for sixty one years , and until in 1848 , the last scrap of this territory came into the Union as the State of Wisconsin , all parties acted in quiet obedience to this ordinance . It is now what Jefferson foresaw and intended the happy home of teeming millions of free , white , prosperous people , and no slave amongst them . Thus , with the author of the declaration of Independence , the policy of prohibiting slavery in new territory originated . Thus , away back of the constitution , in the pure fresh , free breath of the revolution , the State of Virginia , and the National congress put that policy in practice . Thus through sixty odd of the best years of the republic did that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end . And thus , in those five states , and five millions of free , enterprising people , we have before us the rich fruits of this policy . But now new light breaks upon us . Now congress declares this ought never to have been and the like of it , must never be again . The sacred right of self government is grossly violated by it We even find some men , who drew their first breath , and every other breath of their lives , under this very restriction , now live in dread of absolute suffocation , if they should be restricted in the sacred right of taking slaves to Nebraska . That perfect liberty they sigh for the liberty of making slaves of other people Jefferson never thought of their own father never thought of they never thought of themselves , a year ago . How fortunate for them , they did not sooner become sensible of their great misery Oh , how difficult it is to treat with respect , such assaults upon all we have ever really held sacred . But to return to history . In 1803 we purchased what was then called Louisiana , of France . It included the now states of Louisiana , Arkansas , Missouri , and Iowa also the territory of Minnesota , and the present bone of contention , Kansas and Nebraska . Slavery already existed among the French at New Orleans and , to some extent , at Louis . In 1812 Louisiana came into the Union as a slave state , without controversy . In 1818 or 19 , Missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery . This was resisted by northern members of Congress and thus began the first great slavery agitation in the nation . This controversy lasted several months , and became very angry and exciting the House of Representatives voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in Missouri , and the Senate voting as steadily against it . Threats of breaking up the Union were freely made and the ablest public men of the day became seriously alarmed . At length a compromise was made , in which , like all compromises , both sides yielded something . It was a law passed on the 6th day of March , 1820 , providing that Missouri might come into the Union with slavery , but that in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of France , which lies north of 36 degrees and 30 minutes north latitude , slavery should never be permitted . This provision of law , is the Missouri Compromise . In excluding slavery North of the line , the same language is employed as in the Ordinance of 87 . It directly applied to Iowa , Minnesota , and to the present bone of contention , Kansas and Nebraska . Whether there should or should not , be slavery south of that line , nothing was said in the law but Arkansas constituted the principal remaining part , south of the line and it has since been admitted as a slave state without serious controversy . More recently , Iowa , north of the line , came in as a free state without controversy . Still later , Minnesota , north of the line , had a territorial organization without controversy . Texas principally south of the line , and West of Arkansas though originally within the purchase from France , had , in 1819 , been traded off to Spain , in our treaty for the acquisition of Florida . It had thus become a part of Mexico . Mexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain . American citizens began settling rapidly , with their slaves in the southern part of Texas . Soon they revolutionized against Mexico , and established an independent government of their own , adopting a constitution , with slavery , strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave states . By still another rapid move , Texas , claiming a boundary much further West , than when we parted with her in 1819 , was brought back to the United States , and admitted into the Union as a slave state . There then was little or no settlement in the northern part of Texas , a considerable portion of which lay north of the Missouri line and in the resolutions admitting her into the Union , the Missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory . This was in 1845 , only nine years ago . Thus originated the Missouri Compromise and thus has it been respected down to 1845 . And even four years later , in 1849 , our distinguished Senator , in a public address , held the following language in relation to it The Missouri Compromise had been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century , and had received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the Union . It had allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question , and harmonized and tranquilized the whole country . It had given to Henry Clay , as its prominent champion , the proud sobriquet of the Great Pacificator and by that title and for that service , his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard , as a presidential candidate , as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and the power to suppress , an unholy and treasonable agitation , and preserve the Union . He was not aware that any man or any party from any section of the Union , had ever urged as an objection to Clay , that he was the great champion of the Missouri Compromise . On the contrary , the effort was made by the opponents of Clay , to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure , and that the honor was equally due to others as well as to him , for securing its adoption that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men , who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious Union an origin akin that of the constitution of the United States , conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection , and calculated to remove forever , the only danger , which seemed to threaten , at some distant day , to sever the social bond of union . All the evidences of public opinion at that day , seemed to indicate that this Compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the American people , as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb . I do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency . If he afterwards thought he had been wrong , it was right for him to change . I bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the Missouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849 . But , going back a little , in point of time , our war with Mexico broke out in 1846 . When Congress was about adjourning that session , President Polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control , to be used by him in the recess , if found practicable and expedient , in negociating a treaty of peace with Mexico , and acquiring some part of her territory . A bill was duly got up , for the purpose , and was progressing swimmingly , in the House of Representatives , when a member by the name of David Wilmot , a democrat from Pennsylvania , moved as an amendment Provided that in any territory thus acquired , there shall never be slavery . This is the origin of the far famed Wilmot Proviso . It created a great flutter but it stuck like wax , was voted into the bill , and the bill passed with it through the House . The Senate , however , adjourned without final action on it and so both appropriation and proviso were lost , for the time . The war continued , and at the next session , the president renewed his request for the appropriation , enlarging the amount , I think , to three million . Again came the proviso and defeated the measure . Congress adjourned again , and the war went on . In Dec . , 1847 , the new congress assembled . I was in the lower House that term . The Wilmot Proviso or the principle of it , was constantly coming up in some shape or other , and I think I may venture to say I voted for it at least forty times during the short term I was there . The Senate , however , held it in check , and it never became law . In the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with Mexico by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the territories of New Mexico and Utah , and the now state of California . By this treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated , as so far as it was intended to be , a condition of the acquisition of territory . Its friends however , were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country . This new acquisition lay directly West of our old purchase from France , and extended west to the Pacific ocean and was so situated that if the Missouri line should be extended straight West , the new country would be divided by such extended line , leaving some North and some South of it . On Judge Douglas motion a bill , or provision of a bill , passed the Senate to so extend the Missouri line . The Proviso men in the House , including myself , voted it down , because by implication , it gave up the Southern part to slavery , while we were bent on having it all free . In the fall of 1848 the gold mines were discovered in California . This attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity , so that on , or soon after , the meeting of the new congress in Dec . , 1849 , she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand , had called a convention , formed a state constitution , excluding slavery , and was knocking for admission into the Union . The Proviso men , of course were for letting her in , but the Senate , always true to the other side would not consent to her admission . And there California stood , kept out of the Union , because she would not let slavery into her borders . Under all the circumstances perhaps this was not wrong . There were other points of dispute , connected with the general question of slavery , which equally needed adjustment . The South clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law . The North clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the District of Columbia , in connection with which , in view from the windows of the capitol , a sort of negro livery stable , where droves of negroes were collected , temporarily kept , and finally taken to Southern markets , precisely like droves of horses , had been openly maintained for fifty years . Utah and New Mexico needed territorial governments and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them , was another question . The indefinite Western boundary of Texas was to be settled . She was received a slave state and consequently the farther West the slavery men could push her boundary , the more slave country they secured . And the farther East the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back , the less slave ground was secured . Thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others . These points all needed adjustment and they were all held up , perhaps wisely to make them help to adjust one another . The Union , now , as in 1820 , was thought to be in danger and devotion to the Union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat , in points where nothing else could have so inclined them . A compromise was finally effected . The south got their new fugitive slave law and the North got California , the far best part of our acquisition from Mexico , as a free State . The south got a provision that New Mexico and Utah , when admitted as States , may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose and the north got the slave trade abolished in the District of Columbia . The north got the western boundary of Texas , thence further back eastward than the south desired but , in turn , they gave Texas ten millions of dollars , with which to pay her old debts . This is the Compromise of 1850 . Preceding the Presidential election of 1852 , each of the great political parties , democrats and whigs , met in convention , and adopted resolutions endorsing the compromise of 50 as a finality , a final settlement , so far as these parties could make it so , of all slavery agitation . Previous to this , in 1851 , the Illinois Legislature had indorsed it . During this long period of time Nebraska had remained , substantially an uninhabited country , but now emigration to , and settlement within it began to take place . It is about one third as large as the present United States , and its importance so long overlooked , begins to come into view . The restriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise directly applies to it in fact , was first made , and has since been maintained , expressly for it . In 1853 , a bill to give it a territorial government passed the House of Representatives , and , in the hands of Judge Douglas , failed of passing the Senate only for want of time . This bill contained no repeal of the Missouri Compromise . Indeed , when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal , Judge Douglas defended it in its existing form . On January 4th , 1854 , Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska territorial government . He accompanies this bill with a report , in which last , he expressly recommends that the Missouri Compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed . Before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one calling the Southern one Kansas . Also , about a month after the introduction of the bill , on the judge s own motion , it is so amended as to declare the Missouri Compromise inoperative and void and , substantially , that the People who go and settle there may establish slavery , or exclude it , as they may see fit . In this shape the bill passed both branches of congress , and became a law . This is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise . The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but I am sure it is sufficiently so , for all the uses I shall attempt to make of it , and in it , we have before us , the chief material enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong . I think , and shall try to show , that it is wrong wrong in its direct effect , letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska and wrong in its prospective principle , allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world , where men can be found inclined to take it . This declared indifference , but as I must think , covert real zeal for the spread of slavery , I can not but hate . I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself . I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions , with plausibility , to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity , and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty criticising the Declaration of Independence , and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest . Before proceeding , let me say I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people . They are just what we would be in their situation . If slavery did not now exist amongst them , they would not introduce it . If it did now exist amongst us , we should not instantly give it up . This I believe of the masses north and south . Doubtless there are individuals , on both sides , who would not hold slaves under any circumstances and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew , if it were out of existence . We know that some southern men do free their slaves , go north , and become tip top abolitionists while some northern ones go south , and become most cruel slave masters . When southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery , than we I acknowledge the fact . When it is said that the institution exists and that it is very difficult to get rid of it , in any satisfactory way , I can understand and appreciate the saying . I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself . If all earthly power were given me , I should not know what to do , as to the existing institution . My first impulse would be to free all the slaves , and send them to Liberia , to their own native land . But a moment s reflection would convince me , that whatever of high hope , as I think there is there may be in this , in the long run , its sudden execution is impossible . If they were all landed there in a day , they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days . What then Free them all , and keep them among us as underlings Is it quite certain that this betters their condition I think I would not hold one in slavery , at any rate yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon . What next Free them , and make them politically and socially , our equals My own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would , we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not . Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment , is not the sole question , if indeed , it is any part of it . A universal feeling , whether well or ill founded , can not be safely disregarded . We can not , then , make them equals . It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted but for their tardiness in this , I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south . When they remind us of their constitutional rights , I acknowledge them , not grudgingly , but fully , and fairly and I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives , which should not , in its stringency , be more likely to carry a free man into slavery , than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one . But all this to my judgment , furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory , than it would for reviving the African slave trade by law . The law which forbids the bringing of slaves from Africa and that which has so long forbid the taking them to Nebraska , can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter . The arguments by which the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to be justified , are these First , that the Nebraska country needed a territorial government . Second , that in various ways , the public had repudiated it , and demanded the repeal and therefore should not now complain of it . And lastly , that the repeal establishes a principle , which is intrinsically right . I will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn . First , then , if that country was in need of a territorial organization , could it not have had it as well without as with the repeal Iowa and Minnesota , to both of which the Missouri restriction applied , had , without its repeal , each in succession , territorial organizations . And even , the year before , a bill for Nebraska itself , was within an ace of passing , without the repealing clause and this in the hands of the same men who are now the champions of repeal . Why no necessity then for the repeal But still later , when this very bill was first brought in , it contained no repeal . But , say they , because the public had demanded , or rather commanded the repeal , the repeal was to accompany the organization , whenever that should occur . Now I deny that the public ever demanded any such thing ever repudiated the Missouri Compromise ever commanded its repeal . I deny it , and call for the proof . It is not contended , I believe , that any such command has ever been given in express terms . It is only said that it was done in principle . The support of the Wilmot Proviso , is the first fact mentioned , to prove that the Missouri restriction was repudiated in principle , and the second is , the refusal to extend the Missouri line over the country acquired from Mexico . These are near enough alike to be treated together . The one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other was to reject a division of it , by which one half was to be given up to those chances . Now whether this was a repudiation of the Missouri line , in principle , depends upon whether the Missouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended over the country acquired from Mexico . I contend it did not . I insist that it contained no general principle , but that it was , in every sense , specific . That its terms limit it to the country purchased from France , is undenied and undeniable . It could have no principle beyond the intention of those who made it . They did not intend to extend the line to country which they did not own . If they intended to extend it , in the event of acquiring additional territory , why did they not say so It was just as easy to say , that in all the country west of the Mississippi , which we now own , or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery , as to say , what they did say and they would have said it if they had meant it . An intention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law , but is not mentioned in any contemporaneous history . Both the law itself , and the history of the times are a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the known rules for construing statutes and contracts , nor by common sense , can any such principle be inferred . Another fact showing the specific character of the Missouri law showing that it intended no more than it expressed showing that the line was not intended as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory , present and prospective north of which slavery could never go is the fact that by that very law , Missouri came in as a slave state , north of the line . If that law contained any prospective principle , the whole law must be looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was . And by this rule , the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they got one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law , they have the right to have another given them north of it occasionally now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line . This demonstrates the absurdity of attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the Missouri Compromise line . When we voted for the Wilmot Proviso , we were voting to keep slavery out of the whole Missouri acquisition and little did we think we were thereby voting , to let it into Nebraska , laying several hundred miles distant . When we voted against extending the Missouri line , little did we think we were voting to destroy the old line , then of near thirty years standing . To argue that we thus repudiated the Missouri Compromise is no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have , so far , forborne to acquire Cuba , we have thereby , in principle , repudiated our former acquisitions , and determined to throw them out of the Union No less absurd than it would be to say that because I may have refused to build an addition to my house , I thereby have decided to destroy the existing house And if I catch you setting fire to my house , you will turn upon me and say I INSTRUCTED you to do it The most conclusive argument , however , that , while voting for the Wilmot Proviso , and while voting against the EXTENSION of the Missouri line , we never thought of disturbing the original Missouri Compromise , is found in the facts , that there was then , and still is , an unorganized tract of fine country , nearly as large as the state of Missouri , lying immediately west of Arkansas , and south of the Missouri Compromise line and that we never attempted to prohibit slavery as to it . I wish particular attention to this . It adjoins the original Missouri Compromise line , by its northern boundary and consequently is part of the country , into which , by implication , slavery was permitted to go , by that compromise . There it has lain open ever since , and there it still lies . And yet no effort has been made at any time to wrest it from the south . In all our struggles to prohibit slavery within our Mexican acquisitions , we never so much as lifted a finger to prohibit it , as to this tract . Is not this entirely conclusive that at all times , we have held the Missouri Compromise as a sacred thing even when against ourselves , as well as when for us Senator Douglas sometimes says the Missouri line itself was , in principle , only an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87 that is to say , an extension of the Ohio river . I think this is weak enough on its face . I will remark , however that , as a glance at the map will show , the Missouri line is a long way farther South than the Ohio and that if our Senator , in proposing his extension , had stuck to the principle of jogging southward , perhaps it might not have been voted down so readily . But next it is said that the compromises of 50 and the ratification of them by both political parties , in 52 , established a new principle , which required the repeal of the Missouri Compromise . This again I deny . I deny it , and demand the proof . I have already stated fully what the compromises of 50 are . The particular part of those measures , for which the virtual repeal of the Missouri compromise is sought to be inferred for it is admitted they contain nothing about it , in express terms is the provision in the Utah and New Mexico laws , which permits them when they seek admission into the Union as States , to come in with or without slavery as they shall then see fit . Now I insist this provision was made for Utah and New Mexico , and for no other place whatever . It had no more direct reference to Nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon . But , say they , it had reference to Nebraska , in principle . Let us see . The North consented to this provision , not because they considered it right in itself but because they were compensated paid for it . They , at the same time , got California into the Union as a free State . This was far the best part of all they had struggled for by the Wilmot Proviso . They also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement of the boundary of Texas . Also , they got the slave trade abolished in the District of Columbia . For all these desirable objects the North could afford to yield something and they did yield to the South the Utah and New Mexico provision . I do not mean that the whole North , or even a majority , yielded , when the law passed but enough yielded , when added to the vote of the South , to carry the measure . Now can it be pretended that the principle of this arrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to Nebraska , without any equivalent at all Give us another free State press the boundary of Texas still further back , give us another step toward the destruction of slavery in the District , and you present us a similar case . But ask us not to repeat , for nothing , what you paid for in the first instance . If you wish the thing again , pay again . That is the principle of the compromises of 50 , if indeed they had any principles beyond their specific terms it was the system of equivalents . Again , if Congress , at that time , intended that all future territories should , when admitted as States , come in with or without slavery , at their own option , why did it not say so With such an universal provision , all know the bills could not have passed . Did they , then could they establish a principle contrary to their own intention Still further , if they intended to establish the principle that wherever Congress had control , it should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery why did they not authorize the people of the District of Columbia at their adoption to abolish slavery within these limits I personally know that this has not been left undone , because it was unthought of . It was frequently spoken of by members of Congress and by citizens of Washington six years ago and I heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation , with compensation to owners , would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the District . But without the action of Congress they could say nothing and Congress said no . In the measures of 1850 Congress had the subject of slavery in the District expressly in hand . If they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery , why did they not apply the principle to that people Again , it is claimed that by the Resolutions of the Illinois Legislature , passed in 1851 , the repeal of the Missouri compromise was demanded . This I deny also . Whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions , the people have never understood them as being any more than an endorsement of the compromises of 1850 and a release of our Senators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso . The whole people are living witnesses , that this only , was their view . Finally , it is asked If we did not mean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision , to all future territories , what did we mean , when we , in 1852 , endorsed the compromises of 50 For myself , I can answer this question most easily . I meant not to ask a repeal , or modification of the fugitive slave law . I meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia . I meant not to resist the admission of Utah and New Mexico , even should they ask to come in as slave States . I meant nothing about additional territories , because , as I understood , we then had no territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled . As to Nebraska , I regarded its character as being fixed , by the Missouri compromise , for thirty years as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in Illinois . As to new acquisitions I said sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof . When we make new acquaintances , we will , as heretofore , try to manage them some how . That is my answer . That is what I meant and said and I appeal to the people to say , each for himself , whether that was not also the universal meaning of the free States . And now , in turn , let me ask a few questions . If by any , or all these matters , the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was commanded , why was not the command sooner obeyed Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska bill of 1853 Why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854 Why , in the accompanying report , was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended I am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill . This argument seems wonderful to me . It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different . He admits , however , that there is a literal change in the bill and that he made the change in deference to other Senators , who would not support the bill without . This proves that those other Senators thought the change a substantial one and that the Judge thought their opinions worth deferring to . His own opinions , therefore , seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in his own mind and I suppose the world believes , and will continue to believe , that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen . I conclude then , that the public never demanded the repeal of the Missouri compromise . I now come to consider whether the repeal , with its avowed principle , is intrinsically right . I insist that it is not . Take the particular case . A controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery , in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of France . The southern , and then best part of the purchase , was already in as a slave state . The controversy was settled by also letting Missouri in as a slave State but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase , North of a certain line , there should never be slavery . As to what was to be done with the remaining part south of the line , nothing was said but perhaps the fair implication was , that it should come in with slavery if it should so choose . The southern part , except a portion heretofore mentioned , afterwards did come in with slavery , as the State of Arkansas . All these many years since 1820 , the Northern part had remained a wilderness . At length settlements began in it also . In due course , Iowa , came in as a free State , and Minnesota was given a territorial government , without removing the slavery restriction . Finally the sole remaining part , North of the line , Kansas and Nebraska , was to be organized and it is proposed , and carried , to blot out the old dividing line of thirty four years standing , and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery . Now , this , to my mind , is manifestly unjust . After an angry and dangerous controversy , the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention . The one party first appropriates her own share , beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it and then seizes the share of the other party . It is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf the one had hastily swallowed his half , and then grabbed the other half just as he was putting it to his mouth Let me here drop the main argument , to notice what I consider rather an inferior matter . It is argued that slavery will not go to Kansas and Nebraska , in any event . This is a palliation a lullaby . I have some hope that it will not but let us not be too confident . As to climate , a glance at the map shows that there are five slave States Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , Kentucky , and Missouri and also the District of Columbia , all north of the Missouri compromise line . The census returns of 1850 show that , within these , there are 867 , 276 slaves being more than one fourth of all the slaves in the nation . It is not climate , then , that will keep slavery out of these territories . Is there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country Missouri adjoins these territories , by her entire western boundary , and slavery is already within every one of her western counties . I have even heard it said that there are more slaves , in proportion to whites , in the north western county of Missouri , than within any county of the State . Slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the State , and when , rather recently , a part of that boundary , at the north west was moved out a little farther west , slavery followed on quite up to the new line . Now , when the restriction is removed , what is to prevent it from going still further Climate will not . No peculiarity of the country will nothing in nature will . Will the disposition of the people prevent it Those nearest the scene , are all in favor of the extension . The yankees , who are opposed to it may be more numerous but in military phrase , the battle field is too far from their base of operations . But it is said , there now is no law in Nebraska on the subject of slavery and that , in such case , taking a slave there , operates his freedom . That is good book law but is not the rule of actual practice . Wherever slavery is , it has been first introduced without law . The oldest laws we find concerning it , are not laws introducing it but regulating it , as an already existing thing . A white man takes his slave to Nebraska now who will inform the negro that he is free Who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom In ignorance of his legal emancipation , he is kept chopping , splitting and plowing . Others are brought , and move on in the same track . At last , if ever the time for voting comes , on the question of slavery , the institution already in fact exists in the country , and cannot well be removed . The facts of its presence , and the difficulty of its removal will carry the vote in its favor . Keep it out until a vote is taken , and a vote in favor of it , can not be got in any population of forty thousand , on earth , who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement . To get slaves into the country simultaneously with the whites , in the incipient stages of settlement , is the precise stake played for , and won in this Nebraska measure . The question is asked us , If slaves will go in , notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them , why would they not equally go in against positive statute law go in , even if the Missouri restriction were maintained I answer , because it takes a much bolder man to venture in , with his property , in the latter case , than in the former because the positive congressional enactment is known to , and respected by all , or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law is free law , is not much known except among lawyers . We have some experience of this practical difference . In spite of the Ordinance of 87 , a few negroes were brought into Illinois , and held in a state of quasi slavery not enough , however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution . But in the adjoining Missouri country , where there was no ordinance of 87 was no restriction they were carried ten times , nay a hundred times , as fast , and actually made a slave State . This is fact naked fact . Another LULLABY argument is , that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number does not make any one slave who otherwise would be free . There is some truth in this , and I am glad of it , but it not WHOLLY true . The African slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed and if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst us , who are foreigners , and the descendants of foreigners , arriving here since 1808 , we shall find the increase of the black population out running that of the white , to an extent unaccountable , except by supposing that some of them too , have been coming from Africa . If this be so , the opening of new countries to the institution , increases the demand for , and augments the price of slaves , and so does , in fact , make slaves of freemen by causing them to be brought from Africa , and sold into bondage . But , however this may be , we know the opening of new countries to slavery , tends to the perpetuation of the institution , and so does KEEP men in slavery who otherwise would be free . This result we do not FEEL like favoring , and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect . Equal justice to the south , it is said , requires us to consent to the extending of slavery to new countries . That is to say , inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska , therefore I must not object to you taking your slave . Now , I admit this is perfectly logical , if there is no difference between hogs and negroes . But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro , I wish to ask whether you of the south yourselves , have ever been willing to do as much It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world , only a small percentage are natural tyrants . That percentage is no larger in the slave States than in the free . The great majority , south as well as north , have human sympathies , of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain . These sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people , manifest in many ways , their sense of the wrong of slavery , and their consciousness that , after all , there is humanity in the negro . If they deny this , let me address them a few plain questions . In 1820 you joined the north , almost unanimously , in declaring the African slave trade piracy , and in annexing to it the punishment of death . Why did you do this If you did not feel that it was wrong , why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it The practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from Africa , to sell to such as would buy them . But you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses , wild buffaloes or wild bears . Again , you have amongst you , a sneaking individual , of the class of native tyrants , known as the SLAVE DEALER . He watches your necessities , and crawls up to buy your slave , at a speculating price . If you cannot help it , you sell to him but if you can help it , you drive him from your door . You despise him utterly . You do not recognize him as a friend , or even as an honest man . Your children must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negroes , but not with the slave dealers children . If you are obliged to deal with him , you try to get through the job without so much as touching him . It is common with you to join hands with the men you meet but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact . If he grows rich and retires from business , you still remember him , and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon him and his family . Now why is this You do not so treat the man who deals in corn , cattle or tobacco . And yet again there are in the United States and territories , including the District of Columbia , 433 , 643 free blacks . At 500 per head they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars . How comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners We do not see free horses or free cattle running at large . How is this All these free blacks are the descendants of slaves , or have been slaves themselves , and they would be slaves now , but for SOMETHING which has operated on their white owners , inducing them , at vast pecuniary sacrifices , to liberate them . What is that SOMETHINIs there any mistaking it In all these cases it is your sense of justice , and human sympathy , continually telling you , that the poor negro has some natural right to himself that those who deny it , and make mere merchandise of him , deserve kickings , contempt and death . And now , why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate him only as the equal of the hog Why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves Why ask us to do for nothing , what two hundred million of dollars could not induce you to do But one great argument in the support of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , is still to come . That argument is the sacred right of self government . It seems our distinguished Senator has found great difficulty in getting his antagonists , even in the Senate to meet him fairly on this argument some poet has said Fools rush in where angels fear to tread . At the hazzard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation , I meet that argument I rush in , I take that bull by the horns . I trust I understand , and truly estimate the right of self government . My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own , lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me . I extend the principles to communities of men , as well as to individuals . I so extend it , because it is politically wise , as well as naturally just politically wise , in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us . Here , or at Washington , I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia , or the cranberry laws of Indiana . The doctrine of self government is right absolutely and eternally right but it has no just application , as here attempted . Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man . If he is not a man , why in that case , he who is a man may , as a matter of self government , do just as he pleases with him . But if the negro is a man , is it not to that extent , a total destruction of self government , to say that he too shall not govern himself When the white man governs himself that is self government but when he governs himself , and also governs another man , that is more than self government that is despotism . If the negro is a man , why then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man s making a slave of another . Judge Douglas frequently , with bitter irony and sarcasm , paraphrases our argument by saying The white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves , but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes Well I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are , and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere . I do not say the contrary . What I do say is , that no man is good enough to govern another man , without that other s consent . I say this is the leading principle the sheet anchor of American republicanism . Our Declaration of Independence says We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . That to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED . I have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to our ancient faith , the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed . Now the relation of masters and slaves is , PRO TANTa total violation of this principle . The master not only governs the slave without his consent but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself . Allow ALL the governed an equal voice in the government , and that , and that only is self government . Let it not be said I am contending for the establishment of political and social equality between the whites and blacks . I have already said the contrary . I am not now combating the argument of NECESSITarising from the fact that the blacks are already amongst us but I am combating what is set up as MORAL argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never yet been arguing against the EXTENSION of a bad thing , which where it already exists , we must of necessity , manage as we best can . In support of his application of the doctrine of self government , Senator Douglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our revolutionary fathers . I am glad he has done this . I love the sentiments of those old time men and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions . He shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break off from Great Britain , and set up a new government for themselves , several of the states instructed their delegates to go for the measure PROVIDED EACH STATE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO REGULATE ITS DOMESTIC CONCERNS IN ITS OWN WAI do not quote but this in substance . This was right . I see nothing objectionable in it . I also think it probable that it had some reference to the existence of slavery amongst them . I will not deny that it had . But had it , in any reference to the carrying of slavery into NEW COUNTRIEThat is the question and we will let the fathers themselves answer it . This same generation of men , and mostly the same individuals of the generation , who declared this principle who declared independence who fought the war of the revolution through who afterwards made the constitution under which we still live these same men passed the ordinance of 87 , declaring that slavery should never go to the north west territory . I have no doubt Judge Douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this . It is a question of discrimination between them and him . But there is not an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions their example their authority are on his side in this controversy . Again , is not Nebraska , while a territory , a part of us Do we not own the country And if we surrender the control of it , do we not surrender the right of self government It is part of ourselves . If you say we shall not control it because it is ONLY part , the same is true of every other part and when all the parts are gone , what has become of the whole What is then left of us What use for the general government , when there is nothing left for it govern But you say this question should be left to the people of Nebraska , because they are more particularly interested . If this be the rule , you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves . What better moral right have thirty one citizens of Nebraska to say , that the thirty second shall not hold slaves , than the people of the thirty one States have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty second State at all But if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold slaves there , it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of Africa provided you will consent to not hang them for going there to buy them . You must remove this restriction too , from the sacred right of self government . I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States of Nebraska , does not make slaves of freemen but the African slave trader can say just as much . He does not catch free negroes and bring them here . He finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors , and he honestly buys them at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head . This is very cheap , and it is a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade Another important objection to this application of the right of self government , is that it enables the first FEto deprive the succeeding MANof a free exercise of the right of self government . The first few may get slavery Iand the subsequent many cannot easily get it OUHow common is the remark now in the slave States If we were only clear of our slaves , how much better it would be for us . They are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would , by the action of a very few , in the beginning . The same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our constitution was formed . Whether slavery shall go into Nebraska , or other new territories , is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there . The whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories . We want them for the homes of free white people . This they cannot be , to any considerable extent , if slavery shall be planted within them . Slave States are places for poor white people to remove FROnot to remove TNew free States are the places for poor people to go to and better their condition . For this use , the nation needs these territories . Still further there are constitutional relations between the slave and free States , which are degrading to the latter . We are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them a sort of dirty , disagreeable job , which I believe , as a general rule the slave holders will not perform for one another . Then again , in the control of the government the management of the partnership affairs they have greatly the advantage of us . By the constitution , each State has two Senators each has a number of Representatives in proportion to the number of its people and each has a number of presidential electors , equal to the whole number of its Senators and Representatives together . But in ascertaining the number of the people , for this purpose , five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites . The slaves do not vote they are only counted and so used , as to swell the influence of the white people s votes . The practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the States of South Carolina and Maine . South Carolina has six representatives , and so has Maine South Carolina has eight presidential electors , and so has Maine . This is precise equality so far and , of course they are equal in Senators , each having two . Thus in the control of the government , the two States are equals precisely . But how are they in the number of their white people Maine has 581 , 813 while South Carolina has 274 , 567 . Maine has twice as many as South Carolina , and 32 , 679 over . Thus each white man in South Carolina is more than the double of any man in Maine . This is all because South Carolina , besides her free people , has 384 , 984 slaves . The South Carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free State , as well as in Maine . He is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd . The same advantage , but not to the same extent , is held by all the citizens of the slave States , over those of the free and it is an absolute truth , without an exception , that there is no voter in any slave State , but who has more legal power in the government , than any voter in any free State . There is no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through . This principle , in the aggregate , gives the slave States , in the present Congress , twenty additional representatives being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska bill . Now all this is manifestly unfair yet I do not mention it to complain of it , in so far as it is already settled . It is in the constitution and I do not , for that cause , or any other cause , propose to destroy , or alter , or disregard the constitution . I stand to it , fairly , fully , and firmly . But when I am told I must leave it altogether to OTHER PEOPLE to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm , on the same degrading terms against me . I respectfully demur . I insist , that whether I shall be a whole man , or only , the half of one , in comparison with others , is a question in which I am somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me . If I am wrong in this if it really be a sacred right of self government , in the man who shall go to Nebraska , to decide whether he will be the EQUAL of me or the DOUBLE of me , then after he shall have exercised that right , and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than I already am , I should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights , to provide himself with a microscope , and peep about , and find out , if he can , what has become of my sacred rights They will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye . Finally , I insist , that if there is ANY THING which it is the duty of the WHOLE PEOPLE to never entrust to any hands but their own , that thing is the preservation and perpetuity , of their own liberties , and institutions . And if they shall think , as I do , that the extension of slavery endangers them , more than any , or all other causes , how recreant to themselves , if they submit the question , and with it , the fate of their country , to a mere hand full of men , bent only on temporary self interest . If this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one one having no power to do harm it might be shuffled aside in this way . But being , as it is , the great Behemoth of danger , shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosened upon him , to entrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers I have done with this mighty argument , of self government . Go , sacred thing Go in peace . But Nebraska is urged as a great Union saving measure . Well I too , go for saving the Union . Much as I hate slavery , I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved , just as I would consent to any GREAT evil , to avoid a GREATER one . But when I go to Union saving , I must believe , at least , that the means I employ has some adaptation to the end . To my mind , Nebraska has no such adaptation . It hath no relish of salvation in it . It is an aggravation , rather , of the only one thing which ever endangers the Union . When it came upon us , all was peace and quiet . The nation was looking to the forming of new bonds of Union and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us . In the whole range of possibility , there scarcely appears to me to have been any thing , out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived , except the very project of repealing the Missouri compromise . Every inch of territory we owned , already had a definite settlement of the slavery question , and by which , all parties were pledged to abide . Indeed , there was no uninhabited country on the continent , which we could acquire if we except some extreme northern regions , which are wholly out of the question . In this state of case , the genius of Discord himself , could scarcely have invented a way of again getting us by the ears , but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past . The councils of that genius seem to have prevailed , the Missouri compromise was repealed and here we are , in the midst of a new slavery agitation , such , I think , as we have never seen before . Who is responsible for this Is it those who resist the measure or those who , causelessly , brought it forward , and pressed it through , having reason to know , and , in fact , knowing it must and would be so resisted It could not but be expected by its author , that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery , aggravated by a gross breach of faith . Argue as you will , and long as you will , this is the naked FRONT and ASPECof the measure . And in this aspect , it could not but produce agitation . Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man s nature opposition to it , is his love of justice . These principles are an eternal antagonism and when brought into collision so fiercely , as slavery extension brings them , shocks , and throes , and convulsions must ceaselessly follow . Repeal the Missouri compromise repeal all compromises repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past history , you still can not repeal human nature . It still will be the abundance of man s heart , that slavery extension is wrong and out of the abundance of his heart , his mouth will continue to speak . The structure , too , of the Nebraska bill is very peculiar . The people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves but WHEN they are to decide or HOW they are to decide or whether , when the question is once decided , it is to remain so , or is it to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials , the law does not say , Is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there or is it to await the arrival of a hundred Is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or , indeed by a vote of any sort To these questions , the law gives no answer . There is a mystery about this for when a member proposed to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery , it was hooted down by the friends of the bill . This fact is worth remembering . Some yankees , in the east , are sending emigrants to Nebraska , to exclude slavery from it and , so far as I can judge , they expect the question to be decided by voting , in some way or other . But the Missourians are awake too . They are within a stone s throw of the contested ground . They hold meetings , and pass resolutions , in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made . They resolve that slavery already exists in the territory that more shall go there that they , remaining in Missouri will protect it and that abolitionists shall be hung , or driven away . Through all this , bowie knives and six shooters are seen plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box . And , really , what is to be the result of this Each party WITHIhaving numerous and determined backers WITHOUis it not probable that the contest will come to blows , and bloodshed Could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence , on the slavery question , than this Nebraska project is I do not charge , or believe , that such was intended by Congress but if they had literally formed a ring , and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy , the fight could be no more likely to come off , than it is . And if this fight should begin , is it likely to take a very peaceful , Union saving turn Will not the first drop of blood so shed , be the real knell of the Union The Missouri Compromise ought to be restored . For the sake of the Union , it ought to be restored . We ought to elect a House of Representatives which will vote its restoration . If by any means , we omit to do this , what follows Slavery may or may not be established in Nebraska . But whether it be or not , we shall have repudiated discarded from the councils of the Nation the SPIRIT of COMPROMISfor who after this will ever trust in a national compromise The spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first gave us the constitution , and which has thrice saved the Union we shall have strangled and cast from us forever . And what shall we have in lieu of it The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excesses the North , betrayed , as they believe , brooding on wrong and burning for revenge . One side will provoke the other resent . The one will taunt , the other defy one agrees , the other retaliates . Already a few in the North , defy all constitutional restraints , resist the execution of the fugitive slave law , and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists . Already a few in the South , claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slaves in the free states demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with Great Britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada . As yet they are but few on either side . It is a grave question for the lovers of the Union , whether the final destruction of the Missouri Compromise , and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these , and fatally increase the numbers of both . But restore the compromise , and what then We thereby restore the national faith , the national confidence , the national feeling of brotherhood . We thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise that spirit which has never failed us in past perils , and which may be safely trusted for all the future . The south ought to join in doing this . The peace of the nation is as dear to them as to us . In memories of the past and hopes of the future , they share as largely as we . It would be on their part , a great act great in its spirit , and great in its effect . It would be worth to the nation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity . And what of sacrifice would they make They only surrender to us , what they gave us for a consideration long , long ago what they have not now , asked for , struggled or cared for what has been thrust upon them , not less to their own astonishment than to ours . But it is said we cannot restore it that though we elect every member of the lower house , the Senate is still against us . It is quite true , that of the Senators who passed the Nebraska bill , a majority of the whole Senate will retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next year . But if at these elections , their several constituencies shall clearly express their will against Nebraska , will these senators disregard their will Will they neither obey , nor make room for those who will But even if we fail to technically restore the compromise , it is still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration . The moral weight of such a vote can not be estimated too highly . The authors of Nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an endorsement of this PRINCIPLthey proclaim to be the great object . With them , Nebraska alone is a small matter to establish a principle , for FUTURE USis what they particularly desire . That future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world , local and unorganized opposition can not prevent it . Now if you wish to give them this endorsement if you wish to establish this principle do so . I shall regret it but it is your right . On the contrary if you are opposed to the principle intend to give it no such endorsement let no wheedling , no sophistry , divert you from throwing a direct vote against it . Some men , mostly whigs , who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration , lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionist . Will they allow me as an old whig to tell them good humoredly , that I think this is very silly Stand with anybody that stands RIGHStand with him while he is right and PART with him when he goes wrong . Stand WITH the abolitionist in restoring the Missouri Compromise and stand AGAINST him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law . In the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist . What of that you are still right . In both cases you are right . In both cases you oppose the dangerous extremes . In both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady . In both you are national and nothing less than national . This is good old whig ground . To desert such ground , because of any company , is to be less than a whig less than a man less than an American . I particularly object to the NEW position which the avowed principle of this Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic . I object to it because it assumes that there CAN be MORAL RIGHT in the enslaving of one man by another . I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a few people a sad evidence that , feeling prosperity we forget right that liberty , as a principle , we have ceased to revere . I object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed , and rejected it . The argument of Necessity was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery and so far , and so far only as it carried them , did they ever go . They found the institution existing among us , which they could not help and they cast blame upon the British King for having permitted its introduction . BEFORE the constitution , they prohibited its introduction into the north western Territory the only country we owned , then free from it . AT the framing and adoption of the constitution , they forbore to so much as mention the word slave or slavery in the whole instrument . In the provision for the recovery of fugitives , the slave is spoken of as a PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR . In that prohibiting the abolition of the African slave trade for twenty years , that trade is spoken of as The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States NOW EXISTINshall think proper to admit , and c . These are the only provisions alluding to slavery . Thus , the thing is hid away , in the constitution , just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or a cancer , which he dares not cut out at once , lest he bleed to death with the promise , nevertheless , that the cutting may begin at the end of a given time . Less than this our fathers COULD not do and NOW they WOULD not do . Necessity drove them so far , and farther , they would not go . But this is not all . The earliest Congress , under the constitution , took the same view of slavery . They hedged and hemmed it in to the narrowest limits of necessity . In 1794 , they prohibited an out going slave trade that is , the taking of slaves FROM the United States to sell . In 1798 , they prohibited the bringing of slaves from Africa , INTO the Mississippi Territory this territory then comprising what are now the States of Mississippi and Alabama . This was TEN YEARS before they had the authority to do the same thing as to the States existing at the adoption of the constitution . In 1800 they prohibited AMERICAN CITIZENS from trading in slaves between foreign countries as , for instance , from Africa to Brazil . In 1803 they passed a law in aid of one or two State laws , in restraint of the internal slave trade . In 1807 , in apparent hot haste , they passed the law , nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808 the very first day the constitution would permit prohibiting the African slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties . In 1820 , finding these provisions ineffectual , they declared the trade piracy , and annexed to it , the extreme penalty of death . While all this was passing in the general government , five or six of the original slave States had adopted systems of gradual emancipation and by which the institution was rapidly becoming extinct within these limits . Thus we see , the plain unmistakable spirit of that age , towards slavery , was hostility to the PRINCIPLand toleration , ONLY BY NECESSITBut NOW it is to be transformed into a sacred right . Nebraska brings it forth , places it on the high road to extension and perpetuity and , with a pat on its back , says to it , Go , and God speed you . Henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of State . Little by little , but steadily as man s march to the grave , we have been giving up the OLD for the NEW faith . Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration , that for SOME men to enslave OTHERS is a sacred right of self government . These principles can not stand together . They are as opposite as God and mammon and whoever holds to the one , must despise the other . When Pettit , in connection with his support of the Nebraska bill , called the Declaration of Independence a self evident lie he only did what consistency and candor require all other Nebraska men to do . Of the forty odd Nebraska Senators who sat present and heard him , no one rebuked him . Nor am I apprized that any Nebraska newspaper , or any Nebraska orator , in the whole nation , has ever yet rebuked him . If this had been said among Marion s men , Southerners though they were , what would have become of the man who said it If this had been said to the men who captured Andre , the man who said it , would probably have been hung sooner than Andre was . If it had been said in old Independence Hall , seventy eight years ago , the very door keeper would have throttled the man , and thrust him into the street . Let no one be deceived . The spirit of seventy six and the spirit of Nebraska , are utter antagonisms and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter . Fellow countrymen Americans south , as well as north , shall we make no effort to arrest this Already the liberal party throughout the world , express the apprehension that the one retrograde institution in America , is undermining the principles of progress , and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw . This is not the taunt of enemies , but the warning of friends . Is it quite safe to disregard it to despise it Is there no danger to liberty itself , in discarding the earliest practice , and first precept of our ancient faith In our greedy chase to make profit of the negro , let us beware , lest we cancel and tear to pieces even the white man s charter of freedom . Our republican robe is soiled , and trailed in the dust . Let us repurify it . Let us turn and wash it white , in the spirit , if not the blood , of the Revolution . Let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right , back upon its existing legal rights , and its arguments of necessity . Let us return it to the position our fathers gave it and there let it rest in peace . Let us re adopt the Declaration of Independence , and with it , the practices , and policy , which harmonize with it . Let north and south let all Americans let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work . If we do this , we shall not only have saved the Union but we shall have so saved it , as to make , and to keep it , forever worthy of the saving . We shall have so saved it , that the succeeding millions of free happy people , the world over , shall rise up , and call us blessed , to the latest generations . At Springfield , twelve days ago , where I had spoken substantially as I have here , Judge Douglas replied to me and as he is to reply to me here , I shall attempt to anticipate him , by noticing some of the points he made there . He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way through , that the principle of the Nebraska bill , would have the effect of extending slavery . He denied that this was INTENDEor that this EFFECT would follow . I will not re open the argument upon this point . That such was the intention , the world believed at the start , and will continue to believe . This was the COUNTENANCE of the thing and , both friends and enemies , instantly recognized it as such . That countenance can not now be changed by argument . You can as easily argue the color out of the negroes skin . Like the bloody hand you may wash it , and wash it , the red witness of guilt still sticks , and stares horribly at you . Next he says , congressional intervention never prevented slavery , any where that it did not prevent it in the north west territory , now in Illinois that in fact , Illinois came into the Union as a slave State that the principle of the Nebraska bill expelled it from Illinois , from several old States , from every where . Now this is mere quibbling all the way through . If the ordinance of 87 did not keep slavery out of the north west territory , how happens it that the north west shore of the Ohio river is entirely free from it while the south east shore , less than a mile distant , along nearly the whole length of the river , is entirely covered with it If that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois , what was it that made the difference between Illinois and Missouri They lie side by side , the Mississippi river only dividing them while their early settlements were within the same latitude . Between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in Missouri INCREASED 7 , 211 while in Illinois , in the same ten years , they DECREASED 51 . This appears by the census returns . During nearly all of that ten years , both were territories not States . During this time , the ordinance forbid slavery to go into Illinois and NOTHING forbid it to go into Missouri . It DID go into Missouri , and did NOT go into Illinois . That is the fact . Can any one doubt as to the reason of it But , he says , Illinois came into the Union as a slave State . Silence , perhaps , would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country . What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based When we first acquired the country , as far back as 1787 , there were some slaves within it , held by the French inhabitants at Kaskaskia . The territorial legislation , admitted a few negroes , from the slave States , as indentured servants . One year after the adoption of the first State constitution the whole number of them was what do you think just 117 while the aggregate free population was 55 , 094 about 470 to one . Upon this state of facts , the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery , with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants , giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter , and making no mention whatever , of any supposed slave for life . Out of this small matter , the Judge manufactures his argument that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State . Let the facts be the answer to the argument . The principles of the Nebraska bill , he says , expelled slavery from Illinois The principle of that bill first planted it here that is , it first came , because there was no law to prevent it first came before we owned the country and finding it here , and having the ordinance of 87 to prevent its increasing , our people struggled along , and finally got rid of it as best they could . But the principle of the Nebraska bill abolished slavery in several of the old States . Well , it is true that several of the old States , in the last quarter of the last century , did adopt systems of gradual emancipation , by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits but it MAY or MAY NOT be true that the principle of the Nebraska bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures . It is now more than fifty years , since the last of these States adopted its system of emancipation . If Nebraska bill is the real author of these benevolent works , it is rather deplorable , that he has , for so long a time , ceased working all together . Is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the REVOLUTIOand not the principle of Nebraska bill , that led to emancipation in these old States Leave it to the people of those old emancipating States , and I am quite sure they will decide , that neither that , nor any other good thing , ever did , or ever will come of Nebraska bill . In the course of my main argument , Judge Douglas interrupted me to say , that the principle the Nebraska bill was very old that it originated when God made man and placed good and evil before him , allowing him to choose for himself , being responsible for the choice he should make . At the time I thought this was merely playful and I answered it accordingly . But in his reply to me he renewed it , as a serious argument . In seriousness then , the facts of this proposition are not true as stated . God did not place good and evil before man , telling him to make his choice . On the contrary , he did tell him there was one tree , of the fruit of which , he should not eat , upon pain of certain death . I should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska . But this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the Divine right of Kings . By the latter , the King is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects , being responsible to God alone . By the former the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves , being responsible to God alone . The two things are precisely alike and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them . I had argued , that the application of the principle of self government , as contended for , would require the revival of the African slave trade that no argument could be made in favor of a man s right to take slaves to Nebraska , which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of Africa . The Judge replied , that the constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the territories . That is a mistake , in point of fact . The constitution does NOT require the action of Congress in either case and it does AUTHORIZE it in both . And so , there is still no difference between the cases . In regard to what I had said , the advantage the slave States have over the free , in the matter of representation , the Judge replied that we , in the free States , count five free negroes as five white people , while in the slave States , they count five slaves as three whites only and that the advantage , at last , was on the side of the free States . Now , in the slave States , they count free negroes just as we do and it so happens that besides their slaves , they have as many free negroes as we have , and thirty three thousand over . Thus their free negroes more than balance ours and their advantage over us , in consequence of their slaves , still remains as I stated it . In reply to my argument , that the compromise measures of 1850 , were a system of equivalents and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects , without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it , the Judge denied out right , that these measures had any connection with , or dependence upon , each other . This is mere desperation . If they have no connection , why are they always spoken of in connection Why has he so spoken of them , a thousand times Why has he constantly called them a SERIES of measures Why does everybody call them a compromise Why was California kept out of the Union , six or seven months , if it was not because of its connection with the other measures Webster s leading definition of the verb to compromise is to adjust and settle a difference , by mutual agreement with concessions of claims by the parties . This conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise . We knew , before the Judge told us , that these measures passed separately , and in distinct bills and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members . But we also know , and so does he know , that no one of them could have passed both branches of Congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also . Upon this understanding each got votes , which it could have got in no other way . It is this fact , that gives to the measures their true character and it is the universal knowledge of this fact , that has given them the name of compromise so expressive of that true character . I had asked If in carrying the provisions of the Utah and New Mexico laws to Nebraska , you could clear away other objection , how can you leave Nebraska perfectly free to introduce slavery BEFORE she forms a constitution during her territorial government while the Utah and New Mexico laws only authorize it WHEN they form constitutions , and are admitted into the Union To this Judge Douglas answered that the Utah and New Mexico laws , also authorized it BEFORand to prove this , he read from one of their laws , as follows That the legislative power of said territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the constitution of the United States and the provisions of this act . Now it is perceived from the reading of this , that there is nothing express upon the subject but that the authority is sought to be implied merely , for the general provision of all rightful subjects of legislation . In reply to this , I insist , as a legal rule of construction , as well as the plain popular view of the matter , that the EXPRESS provision for Utah and New Mexico coming in with slavery if they choose , when they shall form constitutions , is an EXCLUSION of all implied authority on the same subject that Congress , having the subject distinctly in their minds , when they made the express provision , they therein expressed their WHOLE meaning on that subject . The Judge rather insinuated that I had found it convenient to forget the Washington territorial law passed in 1853 . This was a division of Oregon , organizing the northern part , as the territory of Washington . He asserted that , by this act , the ordinance of 87 theretofore existing in Oregon , was repealed that nearly all the members of Congress voted for it , beginning in the R . , with Charles Allen of Massachusetts , and ending with Richard Yates , of Illinois and that he could not understand how those who now oppose the Nebraska bill , so voted then , unless it was because it was then too soon after both the great political parties had ratified the compromises of 1850 , and the ratification therefore too fresh , to be then repudiated . Now I had seen the Washington act before and I have carefully examined it since and I aver that there is no repeal of the ordinance of 87 , or of any prohibition of slavery , in it . In express terms , there is absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject in fact , nothing to lead a reader to THINK of the subject . To my judgment , it is equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally implied but however this may be , are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication , extracted from covert language , introduced perhaps , for the very purpose of entrapping them I sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through , carefully watching every sentence , and every line , for a repeal of the ordinance of 87 or any thing equivalent to it . Another point on the Washington act . If it was intended to be modelled after the Utah and New Mexico acts , as Judge Douglas , insists , why was it not inserted in it , as in them , that Washington was to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution It has no such provision in it and I defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission , other than that it was not intended to follow the Utah and New Mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery . The Washington act not only differs vitally from the Utah and New Mexico acts but the Nebraska act differs vitally from both . By the latter act the people are left perfectly free to regulate their own domestic concerns , and c . but in all the former , all their laws are to be submitted to Congress , and if disapproved are to be null . The Washington act goes even further it absolutely prohibits the territorial legislation , by very strong and guarded language , from establishing banks , or borrowing money on the faith of the territory . Is this the sacred right of self government we hear vaunted so much No sir , the Nebraska bill finds no model in the acts of 50 or the Washington act . It finds no model in any law from Adam till today . As Phillips says of Napoleon , the Nebraska act is grand , gloomy , and peculiar wrapped in the solitude of its own originality without a model , and without a shadow upon the earth . In the course of his reply , Senator Douglas remarked , in substance , that he had always considered this government was made for the white people and not for the negroes . Why , in point of mere fact , I think so too . But in this remark of the Judge , there is a significance , which I think is the key to the great mistake if there is any such mistake which he has made in this Nebraska measure . It shows that the Judge has no very vivid impression that the negro is a human and consequently has no idea that there can be any moral question in legislating about him . In his view , the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free , is a matter of as utter indifference , as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco , or stock it with horned cattle . Now , whether this view is right or wrong , it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view . They consider slavery a great moral wrong and their feelings against it , is not evanescent , but eternal . It lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice and it cannot be trifled with . It is a great and durable element of popular action , and , I think , no statesman can safely disregard it . Our Senator also objects that those who oppose him in this measure do not entirely agree with one another . He reminds me that in my firm adherence to the constitutional rights of the slave States , I differ widely from others who are co operating with me in opposing the Nebraska bill and he says it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways . He should remember that he took us by surprise astounded us by this measure . We were thunderstruck and stunned and we reeled and fell in utter confusion . But we rose each fighting , grasping whatever he could first reach a scythe a pitchfork a chopping axe , or a butcher s cleaver . We struck in the direction of the sound and we are rapidly closing in upon him . He must not think to divert us from our purpose , by showing us that our drill , our dress , and our weapons , are not entirely perfect and uniform . When the storm shall be past , he shall find us still Americans no less devoted to the continued Union and prosperity of the country than heretofore . Finally , the Judge invokes against me , the memory of Clay and of Webster . They were great men and men of great deeds . But where have I assailed them For what is it , that their life long enemy , shall now make profit , by assuming to defend them against me , their life long friend I go against the repeal of the Missouri compromise did they ever go for it They went for the compromise of 1850 did I ever go against them They were greatly devoted to the Union to the small measure of my ability , was I ever less so Clay and Webster were dead before this question arose by what authority shall our Senator say they would espouse his side of it , if alive Clay was the leading spirit in making the Missouri compromise is it very credible that if now alive , he would take the lead in the breaking of it The truth is that some support from whigs is now a necessity with the Judge , and for thus it is , that the names of Clay and Webster are now invoked . His old friends have deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by . He came to his own , and his own received him not , and Lo he turns unto the Gentiles . A word now as to the Judge s desperate assumption that the compromises of 50 had no connection with one another that Illinois came into the Union as a slave state , and some other similar ones . This is no other than a bold denial of the history of the country . If we do not know that the Compromises of 50 were dependent on each other if we do not know that Illinois came into the Union as a free state we do not know any thing . If we do not know these things , we do not know that we ever had a revolutionary war , or such a chief as Washington . To deny these things is to deny our national axioms , or dogmas , at least and it puts an end to all argument . If a man will stand up and assert , and repeat , and re assert , that two and two do not make four , I know nothing in the power of argument that can stop him . I think I can answer the Judge so long as he sticks to the premises but when he flies from them , I can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag , and actually close his mouth with it . In such a case I can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in from Pennsylvania , Ohio and Indiana . The repeal of the Missouri Compromise , and the propriety of its restoration , constitute the subject of what I am about to say . As I desire to present my own connected view of this subject , my remarks will not be , specifically , an answer to Judge Douglas yet , as I proceed , the main points he has presented will arise , and will receive such respectful attention as I may be able to give them . I wish further to say , that I do not propose to question the patriotism , or to assail the motives of any man , or class of men but rather to strictly confine myself to the naked merits of the question . I also wish to be no less than National in all the positions I may take and whenever I take ground which others have thought , or may think , narrow , sectional and dangerous to the Union , I hope to give a reason , which will appear sufficient , at least to some , why I think differently . And , as this subject is no other , than part and parcel of the larger general question of domestic slavery , I wish to MAKE and to KEEP the distinction between the EXISTING institution , and the EXTENSION of it , so broad , and so clear , that no honest man can misunderstand me , and no dishonest one , successfully misrepresent me . In order to a clear understanding of what the Missouri Compromise is , a short history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper . When we established our independence , we did not own , or claim , the country to which this compromise applies . Indeed , strictly speaking , the confederacy then owned no country at all the States respectively owned the country within their limits and some of them owned territory beyond their strict State limits . Virginia thus owned the North Western territory the country out of which the principal part of Ohio , all Indiana , all Illinois , all Michigan and all Wisconsin , have since been formed . She also owned perhaps within her then limits what has since been formed into the State of Kentucky . North Carolina thus owned what is now the State of Tennessee and South Carolina and Georgia , in separate parts , owned what are now Mississippi and Alabama . Connecticut , I think , owned the little remaining part of Ohio being the same where they now send Giddings to Congress , and beat all creation at making cheese . These territories , together with the States themselves , constituted all the country over which the confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction . We were then living under the Articles of Confederation , which were superceded by the Constitution several years afterwards . The question of ceding these territories to the general government was set on foot . Jefferson , the author of the Declaration of Independence , and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in Congress afterwards twice President who was , is , and perhaps will continue to be , the most distinguished politician of our history a Virginian by birth and continued residence , and withal , a slave holder conceived the idea of taking that occasion , to prevent slavery ever going into the north western territory . He prevailed on the Virginia Legislature to adopt his views , and to cede the territory , making the prohibition of slavery therein , a condition of the deed . Congress accepted the cession , with the condition and in the first Ordinance which the acts of Congress were then called for the government of the territory , provided that slavery should never be permitted therein . This is the famed ordinance of 87 so often spoken of . Thenceforward , for sixty one years , and until in 1848 , the last scrap of this territory came into the Union as the State of Wisconsin , all parties acted in quiet obedience to this ordinance . It is now what Jefferson foresaw and intended the happy home of teeming millions of free , white , prosperous people , and no slave amongst them . Thus , with the author of the declaration of Independence , the policy of prohibiting slavery in new territory originated . Thus , away back of the constitution , in the pure fresh , free breath of the revolution , the State of Virginia , and the National congress put that policy in practice . Thus through sixty odd of the best years of the republic did that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end . And thus , in those five states , and five millions of free , enterprising people , we have before us the rich fruits of this policy . But now new light breaks upon us . Now congress declares this ought never to have been and the like of it , must never be again . The sacred right of self government is grossly violated by it We even find some men , who drew their first breath , and every other breath of their lives , under this very restriction , now live in dread of absolute suffocation , if they should be restricted in the sacred right of taking slaves to Nebraska . That perfect liberty they sigh for the liberty of making slaves of other people Jefferson never thought of their own father never thought of they never thought of themselves , a year ago . How fortunate for them , they did not sooner become sensible of their great misery Oh , how difficult it is to treat with respect , such assaults upon all we have ever really held sacred . But to return to history . In 1803 we purchased what was then called Louisiana , of France . It included the now states of Louisiana , Arkansas , Missouri , and Iowa also the territory of Minnesota , and the present bone of contention , Kansas and Nebraska . Slavery already existed among the French at New Orleans and , to some extent , at Louis . In 1812 Louisiana came into the Union as a slave state , without controversy . In 1818 or 19 , Missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery . This was resisted by northern members of Congress and thus began the first great slavery agitation in the nation . This controversy lasted several months , and became very angry and exciting the House of Representatives voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in Missouri , and the Senate voting as steadily against it . Threats of breaking up the Union were freely made and the ablest public men of the day became seriously alarmed . At length a compromise was made , in which , like all compromises , both sides yielded something . It was a law passed on the 6th day of March , 1820 , providing that Missouri might come into the Union with slavery , but that in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of France , which lies north of 36 degrees and 30 minutes north latitude , slavery should never be permitted . This provision of law , is the Missouri Compromise . In excluding slavery North of the line , the same language is employed as in the Ordinance of 87 . It directly applied to Iowa , Minnesota , and to the present bone of contention , Kansas and Nebraska . Whether there should or should not , be slavery south of that line , nothing was said in the law but Arkansas constituted the principal remaining part , south of the line and it has since been admitted as a slave state without serious controversy . More recently , Iowa , north of the line , came in as a free state without controversy . Still later , Minnesota , north of the line , had a territorial organization without controversy . Texas principally south of the line , and West of Arkansas though originally within the purchase from France , had , in 1819 , been traded off to Spain , in our treaty for the acquisition of Florida . It had thus become a part of Mexico . Mexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain . American citizens began settling rapidly , with their slaves in the southern part of Texas . Soon they revolutionized against Mexico , and established an independent government of their own , adopting a constitution , with slavery , strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave states . By still another rapid move , Texas , claiming a boundary much further West , than when we parted with her in 1819 , was brought back to the United States , and admitted into the Union as a slave state . There then was little or no settlement in the northern part of Texas , a considerable portion of which lay north of the Missouri line and in the resolutions admitting her into the Union , the Missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory . This was in 1845 , only nine years ago . Thus originated the Missouri Compromise and thus has it been respected down to 1845 . And even four years later , in 1849 , our distinguished Senator , in a public address , held the following language in relation to it The Missouri Compromise had been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century , and had received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the Union . It had allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question , and harmonized and tranquilized the whole country . It had given to Henry Clay , as its prominent champion , the proud sobriquet of the Great Pacificator and by that title and for that service , his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard , as a presidential candidate , as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and the power to suppress , an unholy and treasonable agitation , and preserve the Union . He was not aware that any man or any party from any section of the Union , had ever urged as an objection to Clay , that he was the great champion of the Missouri Compromise . On the contrary , the effort was made by the opponents of Clay , to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure , and that the honor was equally due to others as well as to him , for securing its adoption that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men , who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious Union an origin akin that of the constitution of the United States , conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection , and calculated to remove forever , the only danger , which seemed to threaten , at some distant day , to sever the social bond of union . All the evidences of public opinion at that day , seemed to indicate that this Compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the American people , as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb . I do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency . If he afterwards thought he had been wrong , it was right for him to change . I bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the Missouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849 . But , going back a little , in point of time , our war with Mexico broke out in 1846 . When Congress was about adjourning that session , President Polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control , to be used by him in the recess , if found practicable and expedient , in negociating a treaty of peace with Mexico , and acquiring some part of her territory . A bill was duly got up , for the purpose , and was progressing swimmingly , in the House of Representatives , when a member by the name of David Wilmot , a democrat from Pennsylvania , moved as an amendment Provided that in any territory thus acquired , there shall never be slavery . This is the origin of the far famed Wilmot Proviso . It created a great flutter but it stuck like wax , was voted into the bill , and the bill passed with it through the House . The Senate , however , adjourned without final action on it and so both appropriation and proviso were lost , for the time . The war continued , and at the next session , the president renewed his request for the appropriation , enlarging the amount , I think , to three million . Again came the proviso and defeated the measure . Congress adjourned again , and the war went on . In Dec . , 1847 , the new congress assembled . I was in the lower House that term . The Wilmot Proviso or the principle of it , was constantly coming up in some shape or other , and I think I may venture to say I voted for it at least forty times during the short term I was there . The Senate , however , held it in check , and it never became law . In the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with Mexico by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the territories of New Mexico and Utah , and the now state of California . By this treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated , as so far as it was intended to be , a condition of the acquisition of territory . Its friends however , were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country . This new acquisition lay directly West of our old purchase from France , and extended west to the Pacific ocean and was so situated that if the Missouri line should be extended straight West , the new country would be divided by such extended line , leaving some North and some South of it . On Judge Douglas motion a bill , or provision of a bill , passed the Senate to so extend the Missouri line . The Proviso men in the House , including myself , voted it down , because by implication , it gave up the Southern part to slavery , while we were bent on having it all free . In the fall of 1848 the gold mines were discovered in California . This attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity , so that on , or soon after , the meeting of the new congress in Dec . , 1849 , she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand , had called a convention , formed a state constitution , excluding slavery , and was knocking for admission into the Union . The Proviso men , of course were for letting her in , but the Senate , always true to the other side would not consent to her admission . And there California stood , kept out of the Union , because she would not let slavery into her borders . Under all the circumstances perhaps this was not wrong . There were other points of dispute , connected with the general question of slavery , which equally needed adjustment . The South clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law . The North clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the District of Columbia , in connection with which , in view from the windows of the capitol , a sort of negro livery stable , where droves of negroes were collected , temporarily kept , and finally taken to Southern markets , precisely like droves of horses , had been openly maintained for fifty years . Utah and New Mexico needed territorial governments and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them , was another question . The indefinite Western boundary of Texas was to be settled . She was received a slave state and consequently the farther West the slavery men could push her boundary , the more slave country they secured . And the farther East the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back , the less slave ground was secured . Thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others . These points all needed adjustment and they were all held up , perhaps wisely to make them help to adjust one another . The Union , now , as in 1820 , was thought to be in danger and devotion to the Union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat , in points where nothing else could have so inclined them . A compromise was finally effected . The south got their new fugitive slave law and the North got California , the far best part of our acquisition from Mexico , as a free State . The south got a provision that New Mexico and Utah , when admitted as States , may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose and the north got the slave trade abolished in the District of Columbia . The north got the western boundary of Texas , thence further back eastward than the south desired but , in turn , they gave Texas ten millions of dollars , with which to pay her old debts . This is the Compromise of 1850 . Preceding the Presidential election of 1852 , each of the great political parties , democrats and whigs , met in convention , and adopted resolutions endorsing the compromise of 50 as a finality , a final settlement , so far as these parties could make it so , of all slavery agitation . Previous to this , in 1851 , the Illinois Legislature had indorsed it . During this long period of time Nebraska had remained , substantially an uninhabited country , but now emigration to , and settlement within it began to take place . It is about one third as large as the present United States , and its importance so long overlooked , begins to come into view . The restriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise directly applies to it in fact , was first made , and has since been maintained , expressly for it . In 1853 , a bill to give it a territorial government passed the House of Representatives , and , in the hands of Judge Douglas , failed of passing the Senate only for want of time . This bill contained no repeal of the Missouri Compromise . Indeed , when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal , Judge Douglas defended it in its existing form . On January 4th , 1854 , Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska territorial government . He accompanies this bill with a report , in which last , he expressly recommends that the Missouri Compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed . Before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one calling the Southern one Kansas . Also , about a month after the introduction of the bill , on the judge s own motion , it is so amended as to declare the Missouri Compromise inoperative and void and , substantially , that the People who go and settle there may establish slavery , or exclude it , as they may see fit . In this shape the bill passed both branches of congress , and became a law . This is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise . The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but I am sure it is sufficiently so , for all the uses I shall attempt to make of it , and in it , we have before us , the chief material enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong . I think , and shall try to show , that it is wrong wrong in its direct effect , letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska and wrong in its prospective principle , allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world , where men can be found inclined to take it . This declared indifference , but as I must think , covert real zeal for the spread of slavery , I can not but hate . I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself . I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions , with plausibility , to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity , and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty criticising the Declaration of Independence , and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest . Before proceeding , let me say I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people . They are just what we would be in their situation . If slavery did not now exist amongst them , they would not introduce it . If it did now exist amongst us , we should not instantly give it up . This I believe of the masses north and south . Doubtless there are individuals , on both sides , who would not hold slaves under any circumstances and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew , if it were out of existence . We know that some southern men do free their slaves , go north , and become tip top abolitionists while some northern ones go south , and become most cruel slave masters . When southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery , than we I acknowledge the fact . When it is said that the institution exists and that it is very difficult to get rid of it , in any satisfactory way , I can understand and appreciate the saying . I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself . If all earthly power were given me , I should not know what to do , as to the existing institution . My first impulse would be to free all the slaves , and send them to Liberia , to their own native land . But a moment s reflection would convince me , that whatever of high hope , as I think there is there may be in this , in the long run , its sudden execution is impossible . If they were all landed there in a day , they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days . What then Free them all , and keep them among us as underlings Is it quite certain that this betters their condition I think I would not hold one in slavery , at any rate yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon . What next Free them , and make them politically and socially , our equals My own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would , we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not . Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment , is not the sole question , if indeed , it is any part of it . A universal feeling , whether well or ill founded , can not be safely disregarded . We can not , then , make them equals . It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted but for their tardiness in this , I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south . When they remind us of their constitutional rights , I acknowledge them , not grudgingly , but fully , and fairly and I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives , which should not , in its stringency , be more likely to carry a free man into slavery , than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one . But all this to my judgment , furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory , than it would for reviving the African slave trade by law . The law which forbids the bringing of slaves from Africa and that which has so long forbid the taking them to Nebraska , can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter . The arguments by which the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to be justified , are these First , that the Nebraska country needed a territorial government . Second , that in various ways , the public had repudiated it , and demanded the repeal and therefore should not now complain of it . And lastly , that the repeal establishes a principle , which is intrinsically right . I will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn . First , then , if that country was in need of a territorial organization , could it not have had it as well without as with the repeal Iowa and Minnesota , to both of which the Missouri restriction applied , had , without its repeal , each in succession , territorial organizations . And even , the year before , a bill for Nebraska itself , was within an ace of passing , without the repealing clause and this in the hands of the same men who are now the champions of repeal . Why no necessity then for the repeal But still later , when this very bill was first brought in , it contained no repeal . But , say they , because the public had demanded , or rather commanded the repeal , the repeal was to accompany the organization , whenever that should occur . Now I deny that the public ever demanded any such thing ever repudiated the Missouri Compromise ever commanded its repeal . I deny it , and call for the proof . It is not contended , I believe , that any such command has ever been given in express terms . It is only said that it was done in principle . The support of the Wilmot Proviso , is the first fact mentioned , to prove that the Missouri restriction was repudiated in principle , and the second is , the refusal to extend the Missouri line over the country acquired from Mexico . These are near enough alike to be treated together . The one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other was to reject a division of it , by which one half was to be given up to those chances . Now whether this was a repudiation of the Missouri line , in principle , depends upon whether the Missouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended over the country acquired from Mexico . I contend it did not . I insist that it contained no general principle , but that it was , in every sense , specific . That its terms limit it to the country purchased from France , is undenied and undeniable . It could have no principle beyond the intention of those who made it . They did not intend to extend the line to country which they did not own . If they intended to extend it , in the event of acquiring additional territory , why did they not say so It was just as easy to say , that in all the country west of the Mississippi , which we now own , or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery , as to say , what they did say and they would have said it if they had meant it . An intention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law , but is not mentioned in any contemporaneous history . Both the law itself , and the history of the times are a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the known rules for construing statutes and contracts , nor by common sense , can any such principle be inferred . Another fact showing the specific character of the Missouri law showing that it intended no more than it expressed showing that the line was not intended as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory , present and prospective north of which slavery could never go is the fact that by that very law , Missouri came in as a slave state , north of the line . If that law contained any prospective principle , the whole law must be looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was . And by this rule , the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they got one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law , they have the right to have another given them north of it occasionally now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line . This demonstrates the absurdity of attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the Missouri Compromise line . When we voted for the Wilmot Proviso , we were voting to keep slavery out of the whole Missouri acquisition and little did we think we were thereby voting , to let it into Nebraska , laying several hundred miles distant . When we voted against extending the Missouri line , little did we think we were voting to destroy the old line , then of near thirty years standing . To argue that we thus repudiated the Missouri Compromise is no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have , so far , forborne to acquire Cuba , we have thereby , in principle , repudiated our former acquisitions , and determined to throw them out of the Union No less absurd than it would be to say that because I may have refused to build an addition to my house , I thereby have decided to destroy the existing house And if I catch you setting fire to my house , you will turn upon me and say I INSTRUCTED you to do it The most conclusive argument , however , that , while voting for the Wilmot Proviso , and while voting against the EXTENSION of the Missouri line , we never thought of disturbing the original Missouri Compromise , is found in the facts , that there was then , and still is , an unorganized tract of fine country , nearly as large as the state of Missouri , lying immediately west of Arkansas , and south of the Missouri Compromise line and that we never attempted to prohibit slavery as to it . I wish particular attention to this . It adjoins the original Missouri Compromise line , by its northern boundary and consequently is part of the country , into which , by implication , slavery was permitted to go , by that compromise . There it has lain open ever since , and there it still lies . And yet no effort has been made at any time to wrest it from the south . In all our struggles to prohibit slavery within our Mexican acquisitions , we never so much as lifted a finger to prohibit it , as to this tract . Is not this entirely conclusive that at all times , we have held the Missouri Compromise as a sacred thing even when against ourselves , as well as when for us Senator Douglas sometimes says the Missouri line itself was , in principle , only an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87 that is to say , an extension of the Ohio river . I think this is weak enough on its face . I will remark , however that , as a glance at the map will show , the Missouri line is a long way farther South than the Ohio and that if our Senator , in proposing his extension , had stuck to the principle of jogging southward , perhaps it might not have been voted down so readily . But next it is said that the compromises of 50 and the ratification of them by both political parties , in 52 , established a new principle , which required the repeal of the Missouri Compromise . This again I deny . I deny it , and demand the proof . I have already stated fully what the compromises of 50 are . The particular part of those measures , for which the virtual repeal of the Missouri compromise is sought to be inferred for it is admitted they contain nothing about it , in express terms is the provision in the Utah and New Mexico laws , which permits them when they seek admission into the Union as States , to come in with or without slavery as they shall then see fit . Now I insist this provision was made for Utah and New Mexico , and for no other place whatever . It had no more direct reference to Nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon . But , say they , it had reference to Nebraska , in principle . Let us see . The North consented to this provision , not because they considered it right in itself but because they were compensated paid for it . They , at the same time , got California into the Union as a free State . This was far the best part of all they had struggled for by the Wilmot Proviso . They also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement of the boundary of Texas . Also , they got the slave trade abolished in the District of Columbia . For all these desirable objects the North could afford to yield something and they did yield to the South the Utah and New Mexico provision . I do not mean that the whole North , or even a majority , yielded , when the law passed but enough yielded , when added to the vote of the South , to carry the measure . Now can it be pretended that the principle of this arrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to Nebraska , without any equivalent at all Give us another free State press the boundary of Texas still further back , give us another step toward the destruction of slavery in the District , and you present us a similar case . But ask us not to repeat , for nothing , what you paid for in the first instance . If you wish the thing again , pay again . That is the principle of the compromises of 50 , if indeed they had any principles beyond their specific terms it was the system of equivalents . Again , if Congress , at that time , intended that all future territories should , when admitted as States , come in with or without slavery , at their own option , why did it not say so With such an universal provision , all know the bills could not have passed . Did they , then could they establish a principle contrary to their own intention Still further , if they intended to establish the principle that wherever Congress had control , it should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery why did they not authorize the people of the District of Columbia at their adoption to abolish slavery within these limits I personally know that this has not been left undone , because it was unthought of . It was frequently spoken of by members of Congress and by citizens of Washington six years ago and I heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation , with compensation to owners , would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the District . But without the action of Congress they could say nothing and Congress said no . In the measures of 1850 Congress had the subject of slavery in the District expressly in hand . If they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery , why did they not apply the principle to that people Again , it is claimed that by the Resolutions of the Illinois Legislature , passed in 1851 , the repeal of the Missouri compromise was demanded . This I deny also . Whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions , the people have never understood them as being any more than an endorsement of the compromises of 1850 and a release of our Senators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso . The whole people are living witnesses , that this only , was their view . Finally , it is asked If we did not mean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision , to all future territories , what did we mean , when we , in 1852 , endorsed the compromises of 50 For myself , I can answer this question most easily . I meant not to ask a repeal , or modification of the fugitive slave law . I meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia . I meant not to resist the admission of Utah and New Mexico , even should they ask to come in as slave States . I meant nothing about additional territories , because , as I understood , we then had no territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled . As to Nebraska , I regarded its character as being fixed , by the Missouri compromise , for thirty years as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in Illinois . As to new acquisitions I said sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof . When we make new acquaintances , we will , as heretofore , try to manage them some how . That is my answer . That is what I meant and said and I appeal to the people to say , each for himself , whether that was not also the universal meaning of the free States . And now , in turn , let me ask a few questions . If by any , or all these matters , the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was commanded , why was not the command sooner obeyed Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska bill of 1853 Why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854 Why , in the accompanying report , was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended I am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill . This argument seems wonderful to me . It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different . He admits , however , that there is a literal change in the bill and that he made the change in deference to other Senators , who would not support the bill without . This proves that those other Senators thought the change a substantial one and that the Judge thought their opinions worth deferring to . His own opinions , therefore , seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in his own mind and I suppose the world believes , and will continue to believe , that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen . I conclude then , that the public never demanded the repeal of the Missouri compromise . I now come to consider whether the repeal , with its avowed principle , is intrinsically right . I insist that it is not . Take the particular case . A controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery , in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of France . The southern , and then best part of the purchase , was already in as a slave state . The controversy was settled by also letting Missouri in as a slave State but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase , North of a certain line , there should never be slavery . As to what was to be done with the remaining part south of the line , nothing was said but perhaps the fair implication was , that it should come in with slavery if it should so choose . The southern part , except a portion heretofore mentioned , afterwards did come in with slavery , as the State of Arkansas . All these many years since 1820 , the Northern part had remained a wilderness . At length settlements began in it also . In due course , Iowa , came in as a free State , and Minnesota was given a territorial government , without removing the slavery restriction . Finally the sole remaining part , North of the line , Kansas and Nebraska , was to be organized and it is proposed , and carried , to blot out the old dividing line of thirty four years standing , and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery . Now , this , to my mind , is manifestly unjust . After an angry and dangerous controversy , the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention . The one party first appropriates her own share , beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it and then seizes the share of the other party . It is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf the one had hastily swallowed his half , and then grabbed the other half just as he was putting it to his mouth Let me here drop the main argument , to notice what I consider rather an inferior matter . It is argued that slavery will not go to Kansas and Nebraska , in any event . This is a palliation a lullaby . I have some hope that it will not but let us not be too confident . As to climate , a glance at the map shows that there are five slave States Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , Kentucky , and Missouri and also the District of Columbia , all north of the Missouri compromise line . The census returns of 1850 show that , within these , there are 867 , 276 slaves being more than one fourth of all the slaves in the nation . It is not climate , then , that will keep slavery out of these territories . Is there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country Missouri adjoins these territories , by her entire western boundary , and slavery is already within every one of her western counties . I have even heard it said that there are more slaves , in proportion to whites , in the north western county of Missouri , than within any county of the State . Slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the State , and when , rather recently , a part of that boundary , at the north west was moved out a little farther west , slavery followed on quite up to the new line . Now , when the restriction is removed , what is to prevent it from going still further Climate will not . No peculiarity of the country will nothing in nature will . Will the disposition of the people prevent it Those nearest the scene , are all in favor of the extension . The yankees , who are opposed to it may be more numerous but in military phrase , the battle field is too far from their base of operations . But it is said , there now is no law in Nebraska on the subject of slavery and that , in such case , taking a slave there , operates his freedom . That is good book law but is not the rule of actual practice . Wherever slavery is , it has been first introduced without law . The oldest laws we find concerning it , are not laws introducing it but regulating it , as an already existing thing . A white man takes his slave to Nebraska now who will inform the negro that he is free Who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom In ignorance of his legal emancipation , he is kept chopping , splitting and plowing . Others are brought , and move on in the same track . At last , if ever the time for voting comes , on the question of slavery , the institution already in fact exists in the country , and cannot well be removed . The facts of its presence , and the difficulty of its removal will carry the vote in its favor . Keep it out until a vote is taken , and a vote in favor of it , can not be got in any population of forty thousand , on earth , who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement . To get slaves into the country simultaneously with the whites , in the incipient stages of settlement , is the precise stake played for , and won in this Nebraska measure . The question is asked us , If slaves will go in , notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them , why would they not equally go in against positive statute law go in , even if the Missouri restriction were maintained I answer , because it takes a much bolder man to venture in , with his property , in the latter case , than in the former because the positive congressional enactment is known to , and respected by all , or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law is free law , is not much known except among lawyers . We have some experience of this practical difference . In spite of the Ordinance of 87 , a few negroes were brought into Illinois , and held in a state of quasi slavery not enough , however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution . But in the adjoining Missouri country , where there was no ordinance of 87 was no restriction they were carried ten times , nay a hundred times , as fast , and actually made a slave State . This is fact naked fact . Another LULLABY argument is , that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number does not make any one slave who otherwise would be free . There is some truth in this , and I am glad of it , but it not WHOLLY true . The African slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed and if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst us , who are foreigners , and the descendants of foreigners , arriving here since 1808 , we shall find the increase of the black population out running that of the white , to an extent unaccountable , except by supposing that some of them too , have been coming from Africa . If this be so , the opening of new countries to the institution , increases the demand for , and augments the price of slaves , and so does , in fact , make slaves of freemen by causing them to be brought from Africa , and sold into bondage . But , however this may be , we know the opening of new countries to slavery , tends to the perpetuation of the institution , and so does KEEP men in slavery who otherwise would be free . This result we do not FEEL like favoring , and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect . Equal justice to the south , it is said , requires us to consent to the extending of slavery to new countries . That is to say , inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska , therefore I must not object to you taking your slave . Now , I admit this is perfectly logical , if there is no difference between hogs and negroes . But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro , I wish to ask whether you of the south yourselves , have ever been willing to do as much It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world , only a small percentage are natural tyrants . That percentage is no larger in the slave States than in the free . The great majority , south as well as north , have human sympathies , of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain . These sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people , manifest in many ways , their sense of the wrong of slavery , and their consciousness that , after all , there is humanity in the negro . If they deny this , let me address them a few plain questions . In 1820 you joined the north , almost unanimously , in declaring the African slave trade piracy , and in annexing to it the punishment of death . Why did you do this If you did not feel that it was wrong , why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it The practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from Africa , to sell to such as would buy them . But you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses , wild buffaloes or wild bears . Again , you have amongst you , a sneaking individual , of the class of native tyrants , known as the SLAVE DEALER . He watches your necessities , and crawls up to buy your slave , at a speculating price . If you cannot help it , you sell to him but if you can help it , you drive him from your door . You despise him utterly . You do not recognize him as a friend , or even as an honest man . Your children must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negroes , but not with the slave dealers children . If you are obliged to deal with him , you try to get through the job without so much as touching him . It is common with you to join hands with the men you meet but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact . If he grows rich and retires from business , you still remember him , and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon him and his family . Now why is this You do not so treat the man who deals in corn , cattle or tobacco . And yet again there are in the United States and territories , including the District of Columbia , 433 , 643 free blacks . At 500 per head they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars . How comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners We do not see free horses or free cattle running at large . How is this All these free blacks are the descendants of slaves , or have been slaves themselves , and they would be slaves now , but for SOMETHING which has operated on their white owners , inducing them , at vast pecuniary sacrifices , to liberate them . What is that SOMETHINIs there any mistaking it In all these cases it is your sense of justice , and human sympathy , continually telling you , that the poor negro has some natural right to himself that those who deny it , and make mere merchandise of him , deserve kickings , contempt and death . And now , why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate him only as the equal of the hog Why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves Why ask us to do for nothing , what two hundred million of dollars could not induce you to do But one great argument in the support of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , is still to come . That argument is the sacred right of self government . It seems our distinguished Senator has found great difficulty in getting his antagonists , even in the Senate to meet him fairly on this argument some poet has said Fools rush in where angels fear to tread . At the hazzard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation , I meet that argument I rush in , I take that bull by the horns . I trust I understand , and truly estimate the right of self government . My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own , lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me . I extend the principles to communities of men , as well as to individuals . I so extend it , because it is politically wise , as well as naturally just politically wise , in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us . Here , or at Washington , I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia , or the cranberry laws of Indiana . The doctrine of self government is right absolutely and eternally right but it has no just application , as here attempted . Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man . If he is not a man , why in that case , he who is a man may , as a matter of self government , do just as he pleases with him . But if the negro is a man , is it not to that extent , a total destruction of self government , to say that he too shall not govern himself When the white man governs himself that is self government but when he governs himself , and also governs another man , that is more than self government that is despotism . If the negro is a man , why then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man s making a slave of another . Judge Douglas frequently , with bitter irony and sarcasm , paraphrases our argument by saying The white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves , but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes Well I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are , and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere . I do not say the contrary . What I do say is , that no man is good enough to govern another man , without that other s consent . I say this is the leading principle the sheet anchor of American republicanism . Our Declaration of Independence says We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . That to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED . I have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to our ancient faith , the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed . Now the relation of masters and slaves is , PRO TANTa total violation of this principle . The master not only governs the slave without his consent but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself . Allow ALL the governed an equal voice in the government , and that , and that only is self government . Let it not be said I am contending for the establishment of political and social equality between the whites and blacks . I have already said the contrary . I am not now combating the argument of NECESSITarising from the fact that the blacks are already amongst us but I am combating what is set up as MORAL argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never yet been arguing against the EXTENSION of a bad thing , which where it already exists , we must of necessity , manage as we best can . In support of his application of the doctrine of self government , Senator Douglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our revolutionary fathers . I am glad he has done this . I love the sentiments of those old time men and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions . He shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break off from Great Britain , and set up a new government for themselves , several of the states instructed their delegates to go for the measure PROVIDED EACH STATE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO REGULATE ITS DOMESTIC CONCERNS IN ITS OWN WAI do not quote but this in substance . This was right . I see nothing objectionable in it . I also think it probable that it had some reference to the existence of slavery amongst them . I will not deny that it had . But had it , in any reference to the carrying of slavery into NEW COUNTRIEThat is the question and we will let the fathers themselves answer it . This same generation of men , and mostly the same individuals of the generation , who declared this principle who declared independence who fought the war of the revolution through who afterwards made the constitution under which we still live these same men passed the ordinance of 87 , declaring that slavery should never go to the north west territory . I have no doubt Judge Douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this . It is a question of discrimination between them and him . But there is not an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions their example their authority are on his side in this controversy . Again , is not Nebraska , while a territory , a part of us Do we not own the country And if we surrender the control of it , do we not surrender the right of self government It is part of ourselves . If you say we shall not control it because it is ONLY part , the same is true of every other part and when all the parts are gone , what has become of the whole What is then left of us What use for the general government , when there is nothing left for it govern But you say this question should be left to the people of Nebraska , because they are more particularly interested . If this be the rule , you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves . What better moral right have thirty one citizens of Nebraska to say , that the thirty second shall not hold slaves , than the people of the thirty one States have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty second State at all But if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold slaves there , it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of Africa provided you will consent to not hang them for going there to buy them . You must remove this restriction too , from the sacred right of self government . I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States of Nebraska , does not make slaves of freemen but the African slave trader can say just as much . He does not catch free negroes and bring them here . He finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors , and he honestly buys them at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head . This is very cheap , and it is a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade Another important objection to this application of the right of self government , is that it enables the first FEto deprive the succeeding MANof a free exercise of the right of self government . The first few may get slavery Iand the subsequent many cannot easily get it OUHow common is the remark now in the slave States If we were only clear of our slaves , how much better it would be for us . They are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would , by the action of a very few , in the beginning . The same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our constitution was formed . Whether slavery shall go into Nebraska , or other new territories , is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there . The whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories . We want them for the homes of free white people . This they cannot be , to any considerable extent , if slavery shall be planted within them . Slave States are places for poor white people to remove FROnot to remove TNew free States are the places for poor people to go to and better their condition . For this use , the nation needs these territories . Still further there are constitutional relations between the slave and free States , which are degrading to the latter . We are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them a sort of dirty , disagreeable job , which I believe , as a general rule the slave holders will not perform for one another . Then again , in the control of the government the management of the partnership affairs they have greatly the advantage of us . By the constitution , each State has two Senators each has a number of Representatives in proportion to the number of its people and each has a number of presidential electors , equal to the whole number of its Senators and Representatives together . But in ascertaining the number of the people , for this purpose , five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites . The slaves do not vote they are only counted and so used , as to swell the influence of the white people s votes . The practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the States of South Carolina and Maine . South Carolina has six representatives , and so has Maine South Carolina has eight presidential electors , and so has Maine . This is precise equality so far and , of course they are equal in Senators , each having two . Thus in the control of the government , the two States are equals precisely . But how are they in the number of their white people Maine has 581 , 813 while South Carolina has 274 , 567 . Maine has twice as many as South Carolina , and 32 , 679 over . Thus each white man in South Carolina is more than the double of any man in Maine . This is all because South Carolina , besides her free people , has 384 , 984 slaves . The South Carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free State , as well as in Maine . He is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd . The same advantage , but not to the same extent , is held by all the citizens of the slave States , over those of the free and it is an absolute truth , without an exception , that there is no voter in any slave State , but who has more legal power in the government , than any voter in any free State . There is no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through . This principle , in the aggregate , gives the slave States , in the present Congress , twenty additional representatives being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska bill . Now all this is manifestly unfair yet I do not mention it to complain of it , in so far as it is already settled . It is in the constitution and I do not , for that cause , or any other cause , propose to destroy , or alter , or disregard the constitution . I stand to it , fairly , fully , and firmly . But when I am told I must leave it altogether to OTHER PEOPLE to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm , on the same degrading terms against me . I respectfully demur . I insist , that whether I shall be a whole man , or only , the half of one , in comparison with others , is a question in which I am somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me . If I am wrong in this if it really be a sacred right of self government , in the man who shall go to Nebraska , to decide whether he will be the EQUAL of me or the DOUBLE of me , then after he shall have exercised that right , and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than I already am , I should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights , to provide himself with a microscope , and peep about , and find out , if he can , what has become of my sacred rights They will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye . Finally , I insist , that if there is ANY THING which it is the duty of the WHOLE PEOPLE to never entrust to any hands but their own , that thing is the preservation and perpetuity , of their own liberties , and institutions . And if they shall think , as I do , that the extension of slavery endangers them , more than any , or all other causes , how recreant to themselves , if they submit the question , and with it , the fate of their country , to a mere hand full of men , bent only on temporary self interest . If this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one one having no power to do harm it might be shuffled aside in this way . But being , as it is , the great Behemoth of danger , shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosened upon him , to entrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers I have done with this mighty argument , of self government . Go , sacred thing Go in peace . But Nebraska is urged as a great Union saving measure . Well I too , go for saving the Union . Much as I hate slavery , I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved , just as I would consent to any GREAT evil , to avoid a GREATER one . But when I go to Union saving , I must believe , at least , that the means I employ has some adaptation to the end . To my mind , Nebraska has no such adaptation . It hath no relish of salvation in it . It is an aggravation , rather , of the only one thing which ever endangers the Union . When it came upon us , all was peace and quiet . The nation was looking to the forming of new bonds of Union and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us . In the whole range of possibility , there scarcely appears to me to have been any thing , out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived , except the very project of repealing the Missouri compromise . Every inch of territory we owned , already had a definite settlement of the slavery question , and by which , all parties were pledged to abide . Indeed , there was no uninhabited country on the continent , which we could acquire if we except some extreme northern regions , which are wholly out of the question . In this state of case , the genius of Discord himself , could scarcely have invented a way of again getting us by the ears , but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past . The councils of that genius seem to have prevailed , the Missouri compromise was repealed and here we are , in the midst of a new slavery agitation , such , I think , as we have never seen before . Who is responsible for this Is it those who resist the measure or those who , causelessly , brought it forward , and pressed it through , having reason to know , and , in fact , knowing it must and would be so resisted It could not but be expected by its author , that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery , aggravated by a gross breach of faith . Argue as you will , and long as you will , this is the naked FRONT and ASPECof the measure . And in this aspect , it could not but produce agitation . Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man s nature opposition to it , is his love of justice . These principles are an eternal antagonism and when brought into collision so fiercely , as slavery extension brings them , shocks , and throes , and convulsions must ceaselessly follow . Repeal the Missouri compromise repeal all compromises repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past history , you still can not repeal human nature . It still will be the abundance of man s heart , that slavery extension is wrong and out of the abundance of his heart , his mouth will continue to speak . The structure , too , of the Nebraska bill is very peculiar . The people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves but WHEN they are to decide or HOW they are to decide or whether , when the question is once decided , it is to remain so , or is it to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials , the law does not say , Is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there or is it to await the arrival of a hundred Is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or , indeed by a vote of any sort To these questions , the law gives no answer . There is a mystery about this for when a member proposed to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery , it was hooted down by the friends of the bill . This fact is worth remembering . Some yankees , in the east , are sending emigrants to Nebraska , to exclude slavery from it and , so far as I can judge , they expect the question to be decided by voting , in some way or other . But the Missourians are awake too . They are within a stone s throw of the contested ground . They hold meetings , and pass resolutions , in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made . They resolve that slavery already exists in the territory that more shall go there that they , remaining in Missouri will protect it and that abolitionists shall be hung , or driven away . Through all this , bowie knives and six shooters are seen plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box . And , really , what is to be the result of this Each party WITHIhaving numerous and determined backers WITHOUis it not probable that the contest will come to blows , and bloodshed Could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence , on the slavery question , than this Nebraska project is I do not charge , or believe , that such was intended by Congress but if they had literally formed a ring , and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy , the fight could be no more likely to come off , than it is . And if this fight should begin , is it likely to take a very peaceful , Union saving turn Will not the first drop of blood so shed , be the real knell of the Union The Missouri Compromise ought to be restored . For the sake of the Union , it ought to be restored . We ought to elect a House of Representatives which will vote its restoration . If by any means , we omit to do this , what follows Slavery may or may not be established in Nebraska . But whether it be or not , we shall have repudiated discarded from the councils of the Nation the SPIRIT of COMPROMISfor who after this will ever trust in a national compromise The spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first gave us the constitution , and which has thrice saved the Union we shall have strangled and cast from us forever . And what shall we have in lieu of it The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excesses the North , betrayed , as they believe , brooding on wrong and burning for revenge . One side will provoke the other resent . The one will taunt , the other defy one agrees , the other retaliates . Already a few in the North , defy all constitutional restraints , resist the execution of the fugitive slave law , and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists . Already a few in the South , claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slaves in the free states demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with Great Britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada . As yet they are but few on either side . It is a grave question for the lovers of the Union , whether the final destruction of the Missouri Compromise , and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these , and fatally increase the numbers of both . But restore the compromise , and what then We thereby restore the national faith , the national confidence , the national feeling of brotherhood . We thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise that spirit which has never failed us in past perils , and which may be safely trusted for all the future . The south ought to join in doing this . The peace of the nation is as dear to them as to us . In memories of the past and hopes of the future , they share as largely as we . It would be on their part , a great act great in its spirit , and great in its effect . It would be worth to the nation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity . And what of sacrifice would they make They only surrender to us , what they gave us for a consideration long , long ago what they have not now , asked for , struggled or cared for what has been thrust upon them , not less to their own astonishment than to ours . But it is said we cannot restore it that though we elect every member of the lower house , the Senate is still against us . It is quite true , that of the Senators who passed the Nebraska bill , a majority of the whole Senate will retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next year . But if at these elections , their several constituencies shall clearly express their will against Nebraska , will these senators disregard their will Will they neither obey , nor make room for those who will But even if we fail to technically restore the compromise , it is still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration . The moral weight of such a vote can not be estimated too highly . The authors of Nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an endorsement of this PRINCIPLthey proclaim to be the great object . With them , Nebraska alone is a small matter to establish a principle , for FUTURE USis what they particularly desire . That future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world , local and unorganized opposition can not prevent it . Now if you wish to give them this endorsement if you wish to establish this principle do so . I shall regret it but it is your right . On the contrary if you are opposed to the principle intend to give it no such endorsement let no wheedling , no sophistry , divert you from throwing a direct vote against it . Some men , mostly whigs , who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration , lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionist . Will they allow me as an old whig to tell them good humoredly , that I think this is very silly Stand with anybody that stands RIGHStand with him while he is right and PART with him when he goes wrong . Stand WITH the abolitionist in restoring the Missouri Compromise and stand AGAINST him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law . In the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist . What of that you are still right . In both cases you are right . In both cases you oppose the dangerous extremes . In both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady . In both you are national and nothing less than national . This is good old whig ground . To desert such ground , because of any company , is to be less than a whig less than a man less than an American . I particularly object to the NEW position which the avowed principle of this Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic . I object to it because it assumes that there CAN be MORAL RIGHT in the enslaving of one man by another . I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a few people a sad evidence that , feeling prosperity we forget right that liberty , as a principle , we have ceased to revere . I object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed , and rejected it . The argument of Necessity was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery and so far , and so far only as it carried them , did they ever go . They found the institution existing among us , which they could not help and they cast blame upon the British King for having permitted its introduction . BEFORE the constitution , they prohibited its introduction into the north western Territory the only country we owned , then free from it . AT the framing and adoption of the constitution , they forbore to so much as mention the word slave or slavery in the whole instrument . In the provision for the recovery of fugitives , the slave is spoken of as a PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR . In that prohibiting the abolition of the African slave trade for twenty years , that trade is spoken of as The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States NOW EXISTINshall think proper to admit , and c . These are the only provisions alluding to slavery . Thus , the thing is hid away , in the constitution , just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or a cancer , which he dares not cut out at once , lest he bleed to death with the promise , nevertheless , that the cutting may begin at the end of a given time . Less than this our fathers COULD not do and NOW they WOULD not do . Necessity drove them so far , and farther , they would not go . But this is not all . The earliest Congress , under the constitution , took the same view of slavery . They hedged and hemmed it in to the narrowest limits of necessity . In 1794 , they prohibited an out going slave trade that is , the taking of slaves FROM the United States to sell . In 1798 , they prohibited the bringing of slaves from Africa , INTO the Mississippi Territory this territory then comprising what are now the States of Mississippi and Alabama . This was TEN YEARS before they had the authority to do the same thing as to the States existing at the adoption of the constitution . In 1800 they prohibited AMERICAN CITIZENS from trading in slaves between foreign countries as , for instance , from Africa to Brazil . In 1803 they passed a law in aid of one or two State laws , in restraint of the internal slave trade . In 1807 , in apparent hot haste , they passed the law , nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808 the very first day the constitution would permit prohibiting the African slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties . In 1820 , finding these provisions ineffectual , they declared the trade piracy , and annexed to it , the extreme penalty of death . While all this was passing in the general government , five or six of the original slave States had adopted systems of gradual emancipation and by which the institution was rapidly becoming extinct within these limits . Thus we see , the plain unmistakable spirit of that age , towards slavery , was hostility to the PRINCIPLand toleration , ONLY BY NECESSITBut NOW it is to be transformed into a sacred right . Nebraska brings it forth , places it on the high road to extension and perpetuity and , with a pat on its back , says to it , Go , and God speed you . Henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of State . Little by little , but steadily as man s march to the grave , we have been giving up the OLD for the NEW faith . Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration , that for SOME men to enslave OTHERS is a sacred right of self government . These principles can not stand together . They are as opposite as God and mammon and whoever holds to the one , must despise the other . When Pettit , in connection with his support of the Nebraska bill , called the Declaration of Independence a self evident lie he only did what consistency and candor require all other Nebraska men to do . Of the forty odd Nebraska Senators who sat present and heard him , no one rebuked him . Nor am I apprized that any Nebraska newspaper , or any Nebraska orator , in the whole nation , has ever yet rebuked him . If this had been said among Marion s men , Southerners though they were , what would have become of the man who said it If this had been said to the men who captured Andre , the man who said it , would probably have been hung sooner than Andre was . If it had been said in old Independence Hall , seventy eight years ago , the very door keeper would have throttled the man , and thrust him into the street . Let no one be deceived . The spirit of seventy six and the spirit of Nebraska , are utter antagonisms and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter . Fellow countrymen Americans south , as well as north , shall we make no effort to arrest this Already the liberal party throughout the world , express the apprehension that the one retrograde institution in America , is undermining the principles of progress , and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw . This is not the taunt of enemies , but the warning of friends . Is it quite safe to disregard it to despise it Is there no danger to liberty itself , in discarding the earliest practice , and first precept of our ancient faith In our greedy chase to make profit of the negro , let us beware , lest we cancel and tear to pieces even the white man s charter of freedom . Our republican robe is soiled , and trailed in the dust . Let us repurify it . Let us turn and wash it white , in the spirit , if not the blood , of the Revolution . Let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right , back upon its existing legal rights , and its arguments of necessity . Let us return it to the position our fathers gave it and there let it rest in peace . Let us re adopt the Declaration of Independence , and with it , the practices , and policy , which harmonize with it . Let north and south let all Americans let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work . If we do this , we shall not only have saved the Union but we shall have so saved it , as to make , and to keep it , forever worthy of the saving . We shall have so saved it , that the succeeding millions of free happy people , the world over , shall rise up , and call us blessed , to the latest generations . At Springfield , twelve days ago , where I had spoken substantially as I have here , Judge Douglas replied to me and as he is to reply to me here , I shall attempt to anticipate him , by noticing some of the points he made there . He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way through , that the principle of the Nebraska bill , would have the effect of extending slavery . He denied that this was INTENDEor that this EFFECT would follow . I will not re open the argument upon this point . That such was the intention , the world believed at the start , and will continue to believe . This was the COUNTENANCE of the thing and , both friends and enemies , instantly recognized it as such . That countenance can not now be changed by argument . You can as easily argue the color out of the negroes skin . Like the bloody hand you may wash it , and wash it , the red witness of guilt still sticks , and stares horribly at you . Next he says , congressional intervention never prevented slavery , any where that it did not prevent it in the north west territory , now in Illinois that in fact , Illinois came into the Union as a slave State that the principle of the Nebraska bill expelled it from Illinois , from several old States , from every where . Now this is mere quibbling all the way through . If the ordinance of 87 did not keep slavery out of the north west territory , how happens it that the north west shore of the Ohio river is entirely free from it while the south east shore , less than a mile distant , along nearly the whole length of the river , is entirely covered with it If that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois , what was it that made the difference between Illinois and Missouri They lie side by side , the Mississippi river only dividing them while their early settlements were within the same latitude . Between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in Missouri INCREASED 7 , 211 while in Illinois , in the same ten years , they DECREASED 51 . This appears by the census returns . During nearly all of that ten years , both were territories not States . During this time , the ordinance forbid slavery to go into Illinois and NOTHING forbid it to go into Missouri . It DID go into Missouri , and did NOT go into Illinois . That is the fact . Can any one doubt as to the reason of it But , he says , Illinois came into the Union as a slave State . Silence , perhaps , would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country . What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based When we first acquired the country , as far back as 1787 , there were some slaves within it , held by the French inhabitants at Kaskaskia . The territorial legislation , admitted a few negroes , from the slave States , as indentured servants . One year after the adoption of the first State constitution the whole number of them was what do you think just 117 while the aggregate free population was 55 , 094 about 470 to one . Upon this state of facts , the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery , with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants , giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter , and making no mention whatever , of any supposed slave for life . Out of this small matter , the Judge manufactures his argument that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State . Let the facts be the answer to the argument . The principles of the Nebraska bill , he says , expelled slavery from Illinois The principle of that bill first planted it here that is , it first came , because there was no law to prevent it first came before we owned the country and finding it here , and having the ordinance of 87 to prevent its increasing , our people struggled along , and finally got rid of it as best they could . But the principle of the Nebraska bill abolished slavery in several of the old States . Well , it is true that several of the old States , in the last quarter of the last century , did adopt systems of gradual emancipation , by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits but it MAY or MAY NOT be true that the principle of the Nebraska bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures . It is now more than fifty years , since the last of these States adopted its system of emancipation . If Nebraska bill is the real author of these benevolent works , it is rather deplorable , that he has , for so long a time , ceased working all together . Is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the REVOLUTIOand not the principle of Nebraska bill , that led to emancipation in these old States Leave it to the people of those old emancipating States , and I am quite sure they will decide , that neither that , nor any other good thing , ever did , or ever will come of Nebraska bill . In the course of my main argument , Judge Douglas interrupted me to say , that the principle the Nebraska bill was very old that it originated when God made man and placed good and evil before him , allowing him to choose for himself , being responsible for the choice he should make . At the time I thought this was merely playful and I answered it accordingly . But in his reply to me he renewed it , as a serious argument . In seriousness then , the facts of this proposition are not true as stated . God did not place good and evil before man , telling him to make his choice . On the contrary , he did tell him there was one tree , of the fruit of which , he should not eat , upon pain of certain death . I should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska . But this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the Divine right of Kings . By the latter , the King is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects , being responsible to God alone . By the former the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves , being responsible to God alone . The two things are precisely alike and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them . I had argued , that the application of the principle of self government , as contended for , would require the revival of the African slave trade that no argument could be made in favor of a man s right to take slaves to Nebraska , which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of Africa . The Judge replied , that the constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the territories . That is a mistake , in point of fact . The constitution does NOT require the action of Congress in either case and it does AUTHORIZE it in both . And so , there is still no difference between the cases . In regard to what I had said , the advantage the slave States have over the free , in the matter of representation , the Judge replied that we , in the free States , count five free negroes as five white people , while in the slave States , they count five slaves as three whites only and that the advantage , at last , was on the side of the free States . Now , in the slave States , they count free negroes just as we do and it so happens that besides their slaves , they have as many free negroes as we have , and thirty three thousand over . Thus their free negroes more than balance ours and their advantage over us , in consequence of their slaves , still remains as I stated it . In reply to my argument , that the compromise measures of 1850 , were a system of equivalents and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects , without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it , the Judge denied out right , that these measures had any connection with , or dependence upon , each other . This is mere desperation . If they have no connection , why are they always spoken of in connection Why has he so spoken of them , a thousand times Why has he constantly called them a SERIES of measures Why does everybody call them a compromise Why was California kept out of the Union , six or seven months , if it was not because of its connection with the other measures Webster s leading definition of the verb to compromise is to adjust and settle a difference , by mutual agreement with concessions of claims by the parties . This conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise . We knew , before the Judge told us , that these measures passed separately , and in distinct bills and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members . But we also know , and so does he know , that no one of them could have passed both branches of Congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also . Upon this understanding each got votes , which it could have got in no other way . It is this fact , that gives to the measures their true character and it is the universal knowledge of this fact , that has given them the name of compromise so expressive of that true character . I had asked If in carrying the provisions of the Utah and New Mexico laws to Nebraska , you could clear away other objection , how can you leave Nebraska perfectly free to introduce slavery BEFORE she forms a constitution during her territorial government while the Utah and New Mexico laws only authorize it WHEN they form constitutions , and are admitted into the Union To this Judge Douglas answered that the Utah and New Mexico laws , also authorized it BEFORand to prove this , he read from one of their laws , as follows That the legislative power of said territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the constitution of the United States and the provisions of this act . Now it is perceived from the reading of this , that there is nothing express upon the subject but that the authority is sought to be implied merely , for the general provision of all rightful subjects of legislation . In reply to this , I insist , as a legal rule of construction , as well as the plain popular view of the matter , that the EXPRESS provision for Utah and New Mexico coming in with slavery if they choose , when they shall form constitutions , is an EXCLUSION of all implied authority on the same subject that Congress , having the subject distinctly in their minds , when they made the express provision , they therein expressed their WHOLE meaning on that subject . The Judge rather insinuated that I had found it convenient to forget the Washington territorial law passed in 1853 . This was a division of Oregon , organizing the northern part , as the territory of Washington . He asserted that , by this act , the ordinance of 87 theretofore existing in Oregon , was repealed that nearly all the members of Congress voted for it , beginning in the R . , with Charles Allen of Massachusetts , and ending with Richard Yates , of Illinois and that he could not understand how those who now oppose the Nebraska bill , so voted then , unless it was because it was then too soon after both the great political parties had ratified the compromises of 1850 , and the ratification therefore too fresh , to be then repudiated . Now I had seen the Washington act before and I have carefully examined it since and I aver that there is no repeal of the ordinance of 87 , or of any prohibition of slavery , in it . In express terms , there is absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject in fact , nothing to lead a reader to THINK of the subject . To my judgment , it is equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally implied but however this may be , are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication , extracted from covert language , introduced perhaps , for the very purpose of entrapping them I sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through , carefully watching every sentence , and every line , for a repeal of the ordinance of 87 or any thing equivalent to it . Another point on the Washington act . If it was intended to be modelled after the Utah and New Mexico acts , as Judge Douglas , insists , why was it not inserted in it , as in them , that Washington was to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution It has no such provision in it and I defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission , other than that it was not intended to follow the Utah and New Mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery . The Washington act not only differs vitally from the Utah and New Mexico acts but the Nebraska act differs vitally from both . By the latter act the people are left perfectly free to regulate their own domestic concerns , and c . but in all the former , all their laws are to be submitted to Congress , and if disapproved are to be null . The Washington act goes even further it absolutely prohibits the territorial legislation , by very strong and guarded language , from establishing banks , or borrowing money on the faith of the territory . Is this the sacred right of self government we hear vaunted so much No sir , the Nebraska bill finds no model in the acts of 50 or the Washington act . It finds no model in any law from Adam till today . As Phillips says of Napoleon , the Nebraska act is grand , gloomy , and peculiar wrapped in the solitude of its own originality without a model , and without a shadow upon the earth . In the course of his reply , Senator Douglas remarked , in substance , that he had always considered this government was made for the white people and not for the negroes . Why , in point of mere fact , I think so too . But in this remark of the Judge , there is a significance , which I think is the key to the great mistake if there is any such mistake which he has made in this Nebraska measure . It shows that the Judge has no very vivid impression that the negro is a human and consequently has no idea that there can be any moral question in legislating about him . In his view , the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free , is a matter of as utter indifference , as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco , or stock it with horned cattle . Now , whether this view is right or wrong , it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view . They consider slavery a great moral wrong and their feelings against it , is not evanescent , but eternal . It lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice and it cannot be trifled with . It is a great and durable element of popular action , and , I think , no statesman can safely disregard it . Our Senator also objects that those who oppose him in this measure do not entirely agree with one another . He reminds me that in my firm adherence to the constitutional rights of the slave States , I differ widely from others who are co operating with me in opposing the Nebraska bill and he says it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways . He should remember that he took us by surprise astounded us by this measure . We were thunderstruck and stunned and we reeled and fell in utter confusion . But we rose each fighting , grasping whatever he could first reach a scythe a pitchfork a chopping axe , or a butcher s cleaver . We struck in the direction of the sound and we are rapidly closing in upon him . He must not think to divert us from our purpose , by showing us that our drill , our dress , and our weapons , are not entirely perfect and uniform . When the storm shall be past , he shall find us still Americans no less devoted to the continued Union and prosperity of the country than heretofore . Finally , the Judge invokes against me , the memory of Clay and of Webster . They were great men and men of great deeds . But where have I assailed them For what is it , that their life long enemy , shall now make profit , by assuming to defend them against me , their life long friend I go against the repeal of the Missouri compromise did they ever go for it They went for the compromise of 1850 did I ever go against them They were greatly devoted to the Union to the small measure of my ability , was I ever less so Clay and Webster were dead before this question arose by what authority shall our Senator say they would espouse his side of it , if alive Clay was the leading spirit in making the Missouri compromise is it very credible that if now alive , he would take the lead in the breaking of it The truth is that some support from whigs is now a necessity with the Judge , and for thus it is , that the names of Clay and Webster are now invoked . His old friends have deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by . He came to his own , and his own received him not , and Lo he turns unto the Gentiles . A word now as to the Judge s desperate assumption that the compromises of 50 had no connection with one another that Illinois came into the Union as a slave state , and some other similar ones . This is no other than a bold denial of the history of the country . If we do not know that the Compromises of 50 were dependent on each other if we do not know that Illinois came into the Union as a free state we do not know any thing . If we do not know these things , we do not know that we ever had a revolutionary war , or such a chief as Washington . To deny these things is to deny our national axioms , or dogmas , at least and it puts an end to all argument . If a man will stand up and assert , and repeat , and re assert , that two and two do not make four , I know nothing in the power of argument that can stop him . I think I can answer the Judge so long as he sticks to the premises but when he flies from them , I can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag , and actually close his mouth with it . In such a case I can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in from Pennsylvania , Ohio and Indiana .<speech_sep>Honors To Henry ClayOn the fourth day of July , 1776 , the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain , inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America , publicly declared their national independence , and made their appeal to the justice of their cause , and to the God of battles , for the maintainance of that declaration . That people were few in numbers , and without resources , save only their own wise heads and stout hearts . Within the first year of that declared independence , and while its maintainance was yet problematical while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels , and their haughty would be masters , was still waging , of undistinguished parents , and in an obscure district of one of those colonies , Henry Clay was born . The infant nation , and the infant child began the race of life together . For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand . They have been companions ever . The nation has passed its perils , and is free , prosperous , and powerful . The child has reached his manhood , his middle age , his old age , and is dead . In all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathised and now the nation mourns for the man . The day after his death , one of the public Journals , opposed to him politically , held the following pathetic and beautiful language , which I adopt , partly because such high and exclusive eulogy , originating with a political friend , might offend good taste , but chiefly , because I could not , in any language of my own , so well express my thoughts Alas who can realize that Henry Clay is dead Who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council chambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten , or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around Who can realize , that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more , and the magic of that eloquent tongue , which spake as spake no other tongue besides , hushed hushed forever Who can realize that freedom s champion the champion of a civilized world , and of all tongues and kindreds and people , has indeed fallen Alas , in those dark hours , which , as they come in the history of all nations , must come in ours those hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced , and which she may be called to experience again to whom now may her people look up for that council counsel and advice , which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give , and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive Perchance , in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land , there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall one , while we now write , is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and his friend brother , friend ever , yet in political sentiment , as far apart as party could make them . Ah , it is at times like these , that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear . We see only the great , the grand , the noble features of the departed statesman and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents we do not beg this permission we claim it as a right , though we feel it as a privilege . Henry Clay belonged to his country to the world , mere party cannot claim men like him . His career has been national his fame has filled the earth his memory will endure to the last syllable of recorded time . Henry Clay is dead He breathed his last on yesterday at twenty minutes after eleven , in his chamber at Washington . To those who followed his lead in public affairs , it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy , and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead but all Americans may show the grief which his death inspires , for , his character and fame are national property . As on a question of liberty , he knew no North , no South , no East , no West , but only the Union , which held them all in its sacred circle , so now his countrymen will know no grief , that is not as wide spread as the bounds of the confederacy . The career of Henry Clay was a public career . From his youth he has been devoted to the public service , at a period too , in the world s history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs . He witnessed in the beginning the throes of the French Revolution . He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon . He was called upon to legislate for America , and direct her policy when all Europe was the battle field of contending dynasties , and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations . His voice , spoke war and peace in the contest with Great Britain . When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty , his name was mingled with the battle cry of freedom . When South America threw off the thraldom of Spain , his speeches were read at the head of her armies by Bolivar . His name has been , and will continue to be , hallowed in two hemispheres , for it is One of the few the immortal namesThat were not born to die , To the ardent patriot and profound statesman , he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth . His eloquence has not been surpassed . In the effective power to move the heart of man , Clay was without an equal , and the heaven born endowment , in the spirit of its origin , has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud . On at least three important occasions , he has quelled our civil commotions , by a power and influence , which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times . And in our last internal discord , when this Union trembled to its center in old age , he left the shades of private life and gave the death blow to fraternal strife , with the vigor of his earlier years in a series of Senatorial efforts , which in themselves would bring immortality , by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age . He exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic , and gave peace to a distracted land . Alas the achievement cost him his life He sank day by day to the tomb his pale , but noble brow , bound with a triple wreath , put there by a grateful country . May his ashes rest in peace , while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him While it is customary , and proper , upon occasions like the present , to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased in the case of Clay , it is less necessary than most others for his biography has been written and re written , and read , and re read , for the last twenty five years so that , with the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life , all is as well known , as it can be . The short sketch which I give is , therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse . Henry Clay was born on the 12th of April 1777 , in Hanover county , Virginia . Of his father , who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry s age , little seems to be known , except that he was a respectable man , and a preacher of the baptist persuasion . Clay s education , to the end of his life , was comparatively limited . I say to the end of his life , because I have understood that , from time to time , he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life . Clay s lack of a more perfect early education , however it may be regretted generally , teaches at least one profitable lesson it teaches that in this country , one can scarcely be so poor , but that , if he will , he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably . In his twenty third year Clay was licenced to practice law , and emigrated to Lexington , Kentucky . Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803 , when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature . By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806 , when he was elected to fill a vacancy , of a single session , in the United States Senate . In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives , and by that body , chosen its speaker . In 1808 he was re elected to the same body . In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the United States Senate . In 1811 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives , and on the first day of taking his seat in that body , he was chosen its speaker . In 1813 he was again elected Speaker . Early in 1814 , being the period of our last British war , Clay was sent as commissioner , with others , to negotiate a treaty of peace , which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year . On his return from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress , and on taking his seat in December 1815 was called to his old post the speaker s chair , a position in which he was retained , by successive elections , with one brief intermission , till the inauguration of John Adams in March 1825 . He was then appointed Secretary of State , and occupied that important station till the inauguration of Gen . Jackson in March 1829 . After this he returned to Kentucky , resumed the practice of the law , and continued it till the Autumn of 1831 , when he was by the Legislature of Kentucky , again placed in the United States Senate . By a re election he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat , and retired , in March 1842 . In December 1849 he again took his seat in the Senate , which he again resigned only a few months before his death . By the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of Clay s official life , in 1803 , to the end of it in 1852 , is but one year short of half a century and that the sum of all the intervals in it , will not amount to ten years . But mere duration of time in office , constitutes the smallest part of Clay s history . Throughout that long period , he has constantly been the most loved , and most implicitly followed by friends , and the most dreaded by opponents , of all living American politicians . In all the great questions which have agitated the country , and particularly in those great and fearful crises , the Missouri question the Nullification question , and the late slavery question , as connected with the newly acquired territory , involving and endangering the stability of the Union , his has been the leading and most conspicuous part . In 1824 he was first a candidate for the Presidency , and was defeated and , although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 , and in 1844 , there has never been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the American people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the Presidency . With other men , to be defeated , was to be forgotten but to him , defeat was but a trifling incident , neither changing him , or the world s estimate of him . Even those of both political parties , who have been preferred to him for the highest office , have run far briefer courses than he , and left him , still shining , high in the heavens of the political world . Jackson , Van Buren , Harrison , Polk , and Taylor , all rose after , and set long before him . The spell the long enduring spell with which the souls of men were bound to him , is a miracle . Who can compass it It is probably true he owed his pre eminence to no one quality , but to a fortunate combination of several . He was surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent men fail utterly and they are not , as a class , generally successful . His judgment was excellent but many men of good judgment , live and die unnoticed . His will was indomitable but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy . These then were Clay s leading qualities . No one of them is very uncommon but all taken together are rarely combined in a single individual and this is probably the reason why such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world . Clay s eloquence did not consist , as many fine specimens of eloquence does do , of types and figures of antithesis , and elegant arrangement of words and sentences but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone , and manner , which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction , in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause . This it is , that truly touches the chords of human sympathy and those who heard Clay , never failed to be moved by it , or ever afterwards , forgot the impression . All his efforts were made for practical effect . He never spoke merely to be heard . He never delivered a Fourth of July Oration , or an eulogy on an occasion like this . As a politician or statesman , no one was so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground . Whatever he did , he did for the whole country . In the construction of his measures he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field , and duly weighed every conflicting interest . Feeling , as he did , and as the truth surely is , that the world s best hope depended on the continued Union of these States , he was ever jealous of , and watchful for , whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them . Clay s predominant sentiment , from first to last , was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppressed every where , and an ardent wish for their elevation . With him , this was a primary and all controlling passion . Subsidiary to this was the conduct of his whole life . He loved his country partly because it was his own country , but mostly because it was a free country and he burned with a zeal for its advancement , prosperity and glory , because he saw in such , the advancement , prosperity and glory , of human liberty , human right and human nature . He desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen , but chiefly to show to the world that freemen could be prosperous . That his views and measures were always the wisest , needs not to be affirmed nor should it be , on this occasion , where so many , thinking differently , join in doing honor to his memory . A free people , in times of peace and quiet when pressed by no common danger naturally divide into parties . At such times , the man who is of neither party , is not cannot be , of any consequence . Clay , therefore , was of a party . Taking a prominent part , as he did , in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century , the wisdom of his course on many , is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly . But there are many others , about his course upon which , there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic Americans . Of these last are the War of 1812 , the Missouri question , Nullification , and the now recent compromise measures . In 1812 Clay , though not unknown , was still a young man . Whether we should go to war with Great Britain , being the question of the day , a minority opposed the declaration of war by Congress , while the majority , though apparently inclining to war , had , for years , wavered , and hesitated to act decisively . Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied , and grew more daring and aggravated . By Clay , more than any other man , the struggle was brought to a decision in Congress . The question , being now fully before congress , came up , in a variety of ways , in rapid succession , on most of which occasions Clay spoke . Adding to all the logic , of which the subject was susceptible , that noble inspiration , which came to him as it came to no other , he aroused , and nerved , and inspired his friends , and confounded and bore down all opposition . Several of his speeches , on these occasions , were reported , and are still extant but the best of these all never was . During its delivery the reporters forgot their vocations , dropped their pens , and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close . The speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing . The precise language of this speech we shall never know but we do know we cannot help knowing , that , with deep pathos , it pleaded the cause of the injured sailor that it invoked the genius of the revolution that it apostrophised the names of Otis , of Henry and of Washington that it appealed to the interest , the pride , the honor and the glory of the nation that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends that it scorned , and scouted , and withered the temerity of domestic foes that it bearded and defied the British Lion and rising , and swelling , and maddening in its course , it sounded the onset , till the charge , the shock , the steady struggle , and the glorious victory , all passed in vivid review before the entranced hearers . Important and exciting as was the War question , of 1812 , it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the republic , as afterwards did the Missouri question . This sprang from that unfortunate source of discord negro slavery . When our Federal Constitution was adopted , we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the states , except the territory North West of the River Ohio , and East of the Mississippi . What has since been formed into the States of Maine , Kentucky , and Tennessee , was , I believe , within the limits of or owned by Massachusetts , Virginia , and North Carolina . As to the North Western Territory , provision had been made , even before the adoption of the Constitution , that slavery should never go there . On the admission of the States into the Union carved from the territory we owned before the constitution , no question or at most , no considerable question arose about slavery those which were within the limits of or owned by the old states , following , respectively , the condition of the parent state , and those within the North West territory , following the previously made provision . But in 1803 we purchased Louisiana of the French and it included with much more , what has since been formed into the State of Missouri . With regard to it , nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery . When , therefore , in 1819 , Missouri , having formed a State constitution , without excluding slavery , and with slavery already actually existing within its limits , knocked at the door of the Union for admission , almost the entire representation of the non slave holding states , objected . A fearful and angry struggle instantly followed . This alarmed thinking men , more than any previous question , because , unlike all the former , it divided the country by geographical lines . Other questions had their opposing partizans in all localities of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the Union could follow such , without a separation of friends , to quite as great an extent , as that of opponents . Not so with the Missouri question . On this a geographical line could be traced which , in the main , would separate opponents only . This was the danger . Jefferson , then in retirement wrote I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers , or to pay any attention to public affairs , confident they were in good hands , and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not distant . But this momentous question , like a fire bell in the night , awakened , and filled me with terror . I considered it at once as the knell of the Union . It is hushed , indeed , for the moment . But this is a reprieve only , not a final sentence . A geographical line , co inciding with a marked principle , moral and political , once conceived , and held up to the angry passions of men , will never be obliterated and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper . I can say , with conscious truth , that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach , in any practicable way . The cession of that kind of property , for so it is misnamed , is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought , if , in that way , a general emancipation , and expatriation could be effected and , gradually , and with due sacrifices I think it might be . But as it is , we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him , nor safely let him go . Justice is in one scale , and self preservation in the other . Clay was in congress , and , perceiving the danger , at once engaged his whole energies to avert it . It began , as I have said , in 1819 and it did not terminate till 1821 . Missouri would not yield the point and congress that is , a majority in congress by repeated votes , showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield . After several failures , and great labor on the part of Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission , it was , by a vote , rejected , and as all seemed to think , finally . A sullen gloom hung over the nation . All felt that the rejection of Missouri , was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union because those states which already had , what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish , would go with Missouri . All deprecated and deplored this , but none saw how to avert it . For the judgment of Members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding , was not the whole difficulty each had a constituency to meet , and to answer to . Clay , though worn down , and exhausted , was appealed to by members , to renew his efforts at compromise . He did so , and by some judicious modifications of his plan , coupled with laborious efforts with individual members , and his own over mastering eloquence upon the floor , he finally secured the admission of the State . Brightly , and captivating as it had previously shown , it was now perceived that his great eloquence , was a mere embellishment , or , at most , but a helping hand to his inventive genius , and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril . After the settlement of the Missouri question , although a portion of the American people have differed with Clay , and a majority even , appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration , he seems constantly to have been regarded by all , as the man for a crisis . Accordingly , in the days of Nullification , and more recently in the re appearance of the slavery question , connected with our territory newly acquired of Mexico , the task of devising a mode of adjustment , seems to have been cast upon Clay , by common consent and his performance of the task , in each case , was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation . Clay s efforts in behalf of the South Americans , and afterwards , in behalf of the Greeks , in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty are among the finest on record , upon the noblest of all themes and bear ample corroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion a love of liberty and right , unselfishly , and for their own sakes . Having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already , I am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to Clay s views and conduct in regard to it . He ever was , on principle and in feeling , opposed to slavery . The very earliest , and one of the latest public efforts of his life , separated by a period of more than fifty years , were both made in favor of gradual emancipation of the slaves in Kentucky . He did not perceive , that on a question of human right , the negroes were to be excepted from the human race . And yet Clay was the owner of slaves . Cast into life where slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated , he did not perceive , as I think no wise man has perceived , how it could be at once eradicated , without producing a greater evil , even to the cause of human liberty itself . His feeling and his judgment , therefore , ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject . Those who would shiver into fragments the Union of these States tear to tatters its now venerated constitution and even burn the last copy of the Bible , rather than slavery should continue a single hour , together with all their more halting sympathisers , have received , and are receiving their just execration and the name , and opinions , and influence of Clay , are fully , and , as I trust , effectually and enduringly , arrayed against them . But I would also , if I could , array his name , opinions , and influence against the opposite extreme against a few , but an increasing number of men , who , for the sake of perpetuating slavery , are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man s charter of freedom the declaration that all men are created free and equal . So far as I have learned , the first American , of any note , to do or attempt this , was the late John Calhoun and if I mistake not , it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the Governors of South Carolina . We , however , look for , and are not much shocked by , political eccentricities and heresies in South Carolina . But , only last year , I saw with astonishment , what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of Virginia , copied , with apparent approbation , into a Louis newspaper , containing the following , to me , very extraordinary language I am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that is not in mine . Professional abolitionists have made more use of it , than of any passage in the Bible . It came , however , as I trace it , from Saint Voltaire , and was baptized by Thomas Jefferson , and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority All men are born free and equal . This is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation . I am sorry to say that I have never seen two men of whom it is true . But I must admit I never saw the Siamese twins , and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism . This sounds strangely in republican America . The like was not heard in the fresher days of the Republic . Let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man , whose life and death we now commemorate and lament . I quote from a speech of Clay delivered before the American Colonization Society in 1827 . We are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question . The society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquility it addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience . It seeks to affect no man s property . It neither has the power nor the will to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent . The execution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of the property left behind . The society , composed of free men , concerns itself only with the free . Collateral consequences we are not responsible for . It is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which the age exhibits . What would they , who thus reproach us , have done If they would repress all tendencies towards liberty , and ultimate emancipation , they must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society . They must go back to the era of our liberty and independence , and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return . They must renew the slave trade with all its train of atrocities . They must suppress the workings of British philanthropy , seeking to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate West Indian slave . They must arrest the career of South American deliverance from thraldom . They must blow out the moral lights around us , and extinguish that greatest torch of all which America presents to a benighted world pointing the way to their rights , their liberties , and their happiness . And when they have achieved all those purposes their work will be yet incomplete . They must penetrate the human soul , and eradicate the light of reason , and the love of liberty . Then , and not till then , when universal darkness and despair prevail , can you perpetuate slavery , and repress all sympathy , and all humane , and benevolent efforts among free men , in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to bondage . The American Colonization Society was organized in 1816 . Clay , though not its projector , was one of its earliest members and he died , as for the many preceding years he had been , its President . It was one of the most cherished objects of his direct care and consideration and the association of his name with it has probably been its very greatest collateral support . He considered it no demerit in the society , that it tended to relieve slave holders from the troublesome presence of the free negroes but this was far from being its whole merit in his estimation . In the same speech from which I have quoted he says There is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children , whose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence . Transplanted in a foreign land , they will carry back to their native soil the rich fruits of religion , civilization , law and liberty . May it not be one of the great designs of the Ruler of the universe , whose ways are often inscrutable by short sighted mortals , thus to transform an original crime , into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe This suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the African race and African continent , was made twenty five years ago . Every succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization . May it indeed be realized Pharaoh s country was cursed with plagues , and his hosts were drowned in the Red Sea for striving to retain a captive people who had already served them more than four hundred years . May like disasters never befall us If as the friends of colonization hope , the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means , succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery and , at the same time , in restoring a captive people to their long lost father land , with bright prospects for the future and this too , so gradually , that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change , it will indeed be a glorious consummation . And if , to such a consummation , the efforts of Clay shall have contributed , it will be what he most ardently wished , and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind . But Henry Clay is dead . His long and eventful life is closed . Our country is prosperous and powerful but could it have been quite all it has been , and is , and is to be , without Henry Clay Such a man the times have demanded , and such , in the providence of God was given us . But he is gone . Let us strive to deserve , as far as mortals may , the continued care of Divine Providence , trusting that , in future national emergencies , He will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security . Honors To Henry ClayOn the fourth day of July , 1776 , the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain , inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America , publicly declared their national independence , and made their appeal to the justice of their cause , and to the God of battles , for the maintainance of that declaration . That people were few in numbers , and without resources , save only their own wise heads and stout hearts . Within the first year of that declared independence , and while its maintainance was yet problematical while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels , and their haughty would be masters , was still waging , of undistinguished parents , and in an obscure district of one of those colonies , Henry Clay was born . The infant nation , and the infant child began the race of life together . For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand . They have been companions ever . The nation has passed its perils , and is free , prosperous , and powerful . The child has reached his manhood , his middle age , his old age , and is dead . In all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathised and now the nation mourns for the man . The day after his death , one of the public Journals , opposed to him politically , held the following pathetic and beautiful language , which I adopt , partly because such high and exclusive eulogy , originating with a political friend , might offend good taste , but chiefly , because I could not , in any language of my own , so well express my thoughts Alas who can realize that Henry Clay is dead Who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council chambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten , or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around Who can realize , that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more , and the magic of that eloquent tongue , which spake as spake no other tongue besides , hushed hushed forever Who can realize that freedom s champion the champion of a civilized world , and of all tongues and kindreds and people , has indeed fallen Alas , in those dark hours , which , as they come in the history of all nations , must come in ours those hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced , and which she may be called to experience again to whom now may her people look up for that council and advice , which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give , and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive Perchance , in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land , there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall one , while we now write , is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and his friend brother , friend ever , yet in political sentiment , as far apart as party could make them . Ah , it is at times like these , that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear . We see only the great , the grand , the noble features of the departed statesman and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents we do not beg this permission we claim it as a right , though we feel it as a privilege . Henry Clay belonged to his country to the world , mere party cannot claim men like him . His career has been national his fame has filled the earth his memory will endure to the last syllable of recorded time . Henry Clay is dead He breathed his last on yesterday at twenty minutes after eleven , in his chamber at Washington . To those who followed his lead in public affairs , it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy , and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead but all Americans may show the grief which his death inspires , for , his character and fame are national property . As on a question of liberty , he knew no North , no South , no East , no West , but only the Union , which held them all in its sacred circle , so now his countrymen will know no grief , that is not as wide spread as the bounds of the confederacy . The career of Henry Clay was a public career . From his youth he has been devoted to the public service , at a period too , in the world s history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs . He witnessed in the beginning the throes of the French Revolution . He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon . He was called upon to legislate for America , and direct her policy when all Europe was the battle field of contending dynasties , and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations . His voice , spoke war and peace in the contest with Great Britain . When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty , his name was mingled with the battle cry of freedom . When South America threw off the thraldom of Spain , his speeches were read at the head of her armies by Bolivar . His name has been , and will continue to be , hallowed in two hemispheres , for it is One of the few the immortal namesThat were not born to die , To the ardent patriot and profound statesman , he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth . His eloquence has not been surpassed . In the effective power to move the heart of man , Clay was without an equal , and the heaven born endowment , in the spirit of its origin , has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud . On at least three important occasions , he has quelled our civil commotions , by a power and influence , which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times . And in our last internal discord , when this Union trembled to its center in old age , he left the shades of private life and gave the death blow to fraternal strife , with the vigor of his earlier years in a series of Senatorial efforts , which in themselves would bring immortality , by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age . He exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic , and gave peace to a distracted land . Alas the achievement cost him his life He sank day by day to the tomb his pale , but noble brow , bound with a triple wreath , put there by a grateful country . May his ashes rest in peace , while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him While it is customary , and proper , upon occasions like the present , to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased in the case of Clay , it is less necessary than most others for his biography has been written and re written , and read , and re read , for the last twenty five years so that , with the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life , all is as well known , as it can be . The short sketch which I give is , therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse . Henry Clay was born on the 12th of April 1777 , in Hanover county , Virginia . Of his father , who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry s age , little seems to be known , except that he was a respectable man , and a preacher of the baptist persuasion . Clay s education , to the end of his life , was comparatively limited . I say to the end of his life , because I have understood that , from time to time , he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life . Clay s lack of a more perfect early education , however it may be regretted generally , teaches at least one profitable lesson it teaches that in this country , one can scarcely be so poor , but that , if he will , he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably . In his twenty third year Clay was licenced to practice law , and emigrated to Lexington , Kentucky . Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803 , when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature . By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806 , when he was elected to fill a vacancy , of a single session , in the United States Senate . In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives , and by that body , chosen its speaker . In 1808 he was re elected to the same body . In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the United States Senate . In 1811 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives , and on the first day of taking his seat in that body , he was chosen its speaker . In 1813 he was again elected Speaker . Early in 1814 , being the period of our last British war , Clay was sent as commissioner , with others , to negotiate a treaty of peace , which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year . On his return from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress , and on taking his seat in December 1815 was called to his old post the speaker s chair , a position in which he was retained , by successive elections , with one brief intermission , till the inauguration of John Adams in March 1825 . He was then appointed Secretary of State , and occupied that important station till the inauguration of Gen . Jackson in March 1829 . After this he returned to Kentucky , resumed the practice of the law , and continued it till the Autumn of 1831 , when he was by the Legislature of Kentucky , again placed in the United States Senate . By a re election he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat , and retired , in March 1842 . In December 1849 he again took his seat in the Senate , which he again resigned only a few months before his death . By the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of Clay s official life , in 1803 , to the end of it in 1852 , is but one year short of half a century and that the sum of all the intervals in it , will not amount to ten years . But mere duration of time in office , constitutes the smallest part of Clay s history . Throughout that long period , he has constantly been the most loved , and most implicitly followed by friends , and the most dreaded by opponents , of all living American politicians . In all the great questions which have agitated the country , and particularly in those great and fearful crises , the Missouri question the Nullification question , and the late slavery question , as connected with the newly acquired territory , involving and endangering the stability of the Union , his has been the leading and most conspicuous part . In 1824 he was first a candidate for the Presidency , and was defeated and , although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 , and in 1844 , there has never been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the American people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the Presidency . With other men , to be defeated , was to be forgotten but to him , defeat was but a trifling incident , neither changing him , or the world s estimate of him . Even those of both political parties , who have been preferred to him for the highest office , have run far briefer courses than he , and left him , still shining , high in the heavens of the political world . Jackson , Van Buren , Harrison , Polk , and Taylor , all rose after , and set long before him . The spell the long enduring spell with which the souls of men were bound to him , is a miracle . Who can compass it It is probably true he owed his pre eminence to no one quality , but to a fortunate combination of several . He was surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent men fail utterly and they are not , as a class , generally successful . His judgment was excellent but many men of good judgment , live and die unnoticed . His will was indomitable but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy . These then were Clay s leading qualities . No one of them is very uncommon but all taken together are rarely combined in a single individual and this is probably the reason why such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world . Clay s eloquence did not consist , as many fine specimens of eloquence does , of types and figures of antithesis , and elegant arrangement of words and sentences but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone , and manner , which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction , in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause . This it is , that truly touches the chords of human sympathy and those who heard Clay , never failed to be moved by it , or ever afterwards , forgot the impression . All his efforts were made for practical effect . He never spoke merely to be heard . He never delivered a Fourth of July Oration , or an eulogy on an occasion like this . As a politician or statesman , no one was so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground . Whatever he did , he did for the whole country . In the construction of his measures he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field , and duly weighed every conflicting interest . Feeling , as he did , and as the truth surely is , that the world s best hope depended on the continued Union of these States , he was ever jealous of , and watchful for , whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them . Clay s predominant sentiment , from first to last , was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppressed every where , and an ardent wish for their elevation . With him , this was a primary and all controlling passion . Subsidiary to this was the conduct of his whole life . He loved his country partly because it was his own country , but mostly because it was a free country and he burned with a zeal for its advancement , prosperity and glory , because he saw in such , the advancement , prosperity and glory , of human liberty , human right and human nature . He desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen , but chiefly to show to the world that freemen could be prosperous . That his views and measures were always the wisest , needs not to be affirmed nor should it be , on this occasion , where so many , thinking differently , join in doing honor to his memory . A free people , in times of peace and quiet when pressed by no common danger naturally divide into parties . At such times , the man who is of neither party , is not cannot be , of any consequence . Clay , therefore , was of a party . Taking a prominent part , as he did , in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century , the wisdom of his course on many , is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly . But there are many others , about his course upon which , there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic Americans . Of these last are the War of 1812 , the Missouri question , Nullification , and the now recent compromise measures . In 1812 Clay , though not unknown , was still a young man . Whether we should go to war with Great Britain , being the question of the day , a minority opposed the declaration of war by Congress , while the majority , though apparently inclining to war , had , for years , wavered , and hesitated to act decisively . Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied , and grew more daring and aggravated . By Clay , more than any other man , the struggle was brought to a decision in Congress . The question , being now fully before congress , came up , in a variety of ways , in rapid succession , on most of which occasions Clay spoke . Adding to all the logic , of which the subject was susceptible , that noble inspiration , which came to him as it came to no other , he aroused , and nerved , and inspired his friends , and confounded and bore down all opposition . Several of his speeches , on these occasions , were reported , and are still extant but the best of these all never was . During its delivery the reporters forgot their vocations , dropped their pens , and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close . The speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing . The precise language of this speech we shall never know but we do know we cannot help knowing , that , with deep pathos , it pleaded the cause of the injured sailor that it invoked the genius of the revolution that it apostrophised the names of Otis , of Henry and of Washington that it appealed to the interest , the pride , the honor and the glory of the nation that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends that it scorned , and scouted , and withered the temerity of domestic foes that it bearded and defied the British Lion and rising , and swelling , and maddening in its course , it sounded the onset , till the charge , the shock , the steady struggle , and the glorious victory , all passed in vivid review before the entranced hearers . Important and exciting as was the War question , of 1812 , it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the republic , as afterwards did the Missouri question . This sprang from that unfortunate source of discord negro slavery . When our Federal Constitution was adopted , we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the states , except the territory North West of the River Ohio , and East of the Mississippi . What has since been formed into the States of Maine , Kentucky , and Tennessee , was , I believe , within the limits of or owned by Massachusetts , Virginia , and North Carolina . As to the North Western Territory , provision had been made , even before the adoption of the Constitution , that slavery should never go there . On the admission of the States into the Union carved from the territory we owned before the constitution , no question or at most , no considerable question arose about slavery those which were within the limits of or owned by the old states , following , respectively , the condition of the parent state , and those within the North West territory , following the previously made provision . But in 1803 we purchased Louisiana of the French and it included with much more , what has since been formed into the State of Missouri . With regard to it , nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery . When , therefore , in 1819 , Missouri , having formed a State constitution , without excluding slavery , and with slavery already actually existing within its limits , knocked at the door of the Union for admission , almost the entire representation of the non slave holding states , objected . A fearful and angry struggle instantly followed . This alarmed thinking men , more than any previous question , because , unlike all the former , it divided the country by geographical lines . Other questions had their opposing partizans in all localities of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the Union could follow such , without a separation of friends , to quite as great an extent , as that of opponents . Not so with the Missouri question . On this a geographical line could be traced which , in the main , would separate opponents only . This was the danger . Jefferson , then in retirement wrote I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers , or to pay any attention to public affairs , confident they were in good hands , and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not distant . But this momentous question , like a fire bell in the night , awakened , and filled me with terror . I considered it at once as the knell of the Union . It is hushed , indeed , for the moment . But this is a reprieve only , not a final sentence . A geographical line , co inciding with a marked principle , moral and political , once conceived , and held up to the angry passions of men , will never be obliterated and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper . I can say , with conscious truth , that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach , in any practicable way . The cession of that kind of property , for so it is misnamed , is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought , if , in that way , a general emancipation , and expatriation could be effected and , gradually , and with due sacrifices I think it might be . But as it is , we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him , nor safely let him go . Justice is in one scale , and self preservation in the other . Clay was in congress , and , perceiving the danger , at once engaged his whole energies to avert it . It began , as I have said , in 1819 and it did not terminate till 1821 . Missouri would not yield the point and congress that is , a majority in congress by repeated votes , showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield . After several failures , and great labor on the part of Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission , it was , by a vote , rejected , and as all seemed to think , finally . A sullen gloom hung over the nation . All felt that the rejection of Missouri , was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union because those states which already had , what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish , would go with Missouri . All deprecated and deplored this , but none saw how to avert it . For the judgment of Members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding , was not the whole difficulty each had a constituency to meet , and to answer to . Clay , though worn down , and exhausted , was appealed to by members , to renew his efforts at compromise . He did so , and by some judicious modifications of his plan , coupled with laborious efforts with individual members , and his own over mastering eloquence upon the floor , he finally secured the admission of the State . Brightly , and captivating as it had previously shown , it was now perceived that his great eloquence , was a mere embellishment , or , at most , but a helping hand to his inventive genius , and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril . After the settlement of the Missouri question , although a portion of the American people have differed with Clay , and a majority even , appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration , he seems constantly to have been regarded by all , as the man for a crisis . Accordingly , in the days of Nullification , and more recently in the re appearance of the slavery question , connected with our territory newly acquired of Mexico , the task of devising a mode of adjustment , seems to have been cast upon Clay , by common consent and his performance of the task , in each case , was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation . Clay s efforts in behalf of the South Americans , and afterwards , in behalf of the Greeks , in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty are among the finest on record , upon the noblest of all themes and bear ample corroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion a love of liberty and right , unselfishly , and for their own sakes . Having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already , I am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to Clay s views and conduct in regard to it . He ever was , on principle and in feeling , opposed to slavery . The very earliest , and one of the latest public efforts of his life , separated by a period of more than fifty years , were both made in favor of gradual emancipation of the slaves in Kentucky . He did not perceive , that on a question of human right , the negroes were to be excepted from the human race . And yet Clay was the owner of slaves . Cast into life where slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated , he did not perceive , as I think no wise man has perceived , how it could be at once eradicated , without producing a greater evil , even to the cause of human liberty itself . His feeling and his judgment , therefore , ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject . Those who would shiver into fragments the Union of these States tear to tatters its now venerated constitution and even burn the last copy of the Bible , rather than slavery should continue a single hour , together with all their more halting sympathisers , have received , and are receiving their just execration and the name , and opinions , and influence of Clay , are fully , and , as I trust , effectually and enduringly , arrayed against them . But I would also , if I could , array his name , opinions , and influence against the opposite extreme against a few , but an increasing number of men , who , for the sake of perpetuating slavery , are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man s charter of freedom the declaration that all men are created free and equal . So far as I have learned , the first American , of any note , to do or attempt this , was the late John Calhoun and if I mistake not , it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the Governors of South Carolina . We , however , look for , and are not much shocked by , political eccentricities and heresies in South Carolina . But , only last year , I saw with astonishment , what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of Virginia , copied , with apparent approbation , into a Louis newspaper , containing the following , to me , very extraordinary language I am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that is not in mine . Professional abolitionists have made more use of it , than of any passage in the Bible . It came , however , as I trace it , from Saint Voltaire , and was baptized by Thomas Jefferson , and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority All men are born free and equal . This is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation . I am sorry to say that I have never seen two men of whom it is true . But I must admit I never saw the Siamese twins , and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism . This sounds strangely in republican America . The like was not heard in the fresher days of the Republic . Let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man , whose life and death we now commemorate and lament . I quote from a speech of Clay delivered before the American Colonization Society in 1827 . We are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question . The society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquility it addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience . It seeks to affect no man s property .

They must arrest the career of South American deliverance from thraldom .

And if , to such a consummation , the efforts of Clay shall have contributed , it will be what he most ardently wished , and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind . But Henry Clay is dead . His long and eventful life is closed . Our country is prosperous and powerful but could it have been quite all it has been , and is , and is to be , without Henry Clay Such a man the times have demanded , and such , in the providence of God was given us . But he is gone . Let us strive to deserve , as far as mortals may , the continued care of Divine Providence , trusting that , in future national emergencies , He will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security .<speech_sep>
