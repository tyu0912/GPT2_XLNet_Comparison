Good evening . During the next few minutes , I want to update you on the progress we are making in our war against terror , and to propose sweeping changes that will strengthen our homeland against the ongoing threat of terrorist attacks . Nearly nine months have passed since the day that forever changed our country . Debris from what was once the World Trade Center has been cleared away in a hundred thousand truckloads . The west side of the Pentagon looks almost as it did on September the 10th . And as children finish school and families prepare for summer vacations , for many , life seems almost normal . Yet we are a different nation today sadder and stronger , less innocent and more courageous , more appreciative of life , and for many who serve our country , more willing to risk life in a great cause . For those who have lost family and friends , the pain will never go away and neither will the responsibilities that day thrust upon all of us . America is leading the civilized world in a titanic struggle against terror . Freedom and fear are at war and freedom is winning . Tonight over 60 , 000 American troops are deployed around the world in the war against terror more than 7 , 000 in Afghanistan others in the Philippines , Yemen , and the Republic of Georgia , to train local forces . Next week Afghanistan will begin selecting a representative government , even as American troops , along with our allies , still continuously raid remote al Qaeda hiding places . Among those we have captured is a man named Abu Zabedah , al Qaeda s chief of operations . From him , and from hundreds of others , we are learning more about how the terrorists plan and operate information crucial in anticipating and preventing future attacks . Our coalition is strong . More than 90 nations have arrested or detained over 2 , 400 terrorists and their supporters . More than 180 countries have offered or are providing assistance in the war on terrorism . And our military is strong and prepared to oppose any emerging threat to the American people . Every day in this war will not bring the drama of liberating a country . Yet every day brings new information , a tip or arrest , another step , or two , or three in a relentless march to bring security to our nation and justice to our enemies . Every day I review a document called the threat assessment . It summarizes what our intelligence services and key law enforcement agencies have picked up about terrorist activity . Sometimes the information is very general vague talk , bragging about future attacks . Sometimes the information is more specific , as in a recent case when an al Qaeda detainee said attacks were planned against financial institutions . When credible intelligence warrants , appropriate law enforcement and local officials are alerted . These warnings are , unfortunately , a new reality in American life and we have recently seen an increase in the volume of general threats . Americans should continue to do what you are doing go about your lives , but pay attention to your surroundings . Add your eyes and ears to the protection of our homeland . In protecting our country , we depend on the skill of our people the troops we send to battle , intelligence operatives who risk their lives for bits of information , law enforcement officers who sift for clues and search for suspects . We are now learning that before September the 11th , the suspicions and insights of some of our front line agents did not get enough attention . My administration supports the important work of the intelligence committees in Congress to review the activities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies . We need to know when warnings were missed or signs unheeded not to point the finger of blame , but to make sure we correct any problems , and prevent them from happening again . Based on everything I have seen , I do not believe anyone could have prevented the horror of September the 11th . Yet we now know that thousands of trained killers are plotting to attack us , and this terrible knowledge requires us to act differently . If you are a front line worker for the FBthe CIsome other law enforcement or intelligence agency , and you see something that raises suspicions , I want you to report it immediately . I expect your supervisors to treat it with the seriousness it deserves . Information must be fully shared , so we can follow every lead to find the one that may prevent tragedy . I applaud the leaders and employees at the FBI and CIA for beginning essential reforms . They must continue to think and act differently to defeat the enemy . The first and best way to secure America s homeland is to attack the enemy where he hides and plans , and we are doing just that . We are also taking significant steps to strengthen our homeland protections securing cockpits , tightening our borders , stockpiling vaccines , increasing security at water treatment and nuclear power plants . After September the 11th , we needed to move quickly , and so I appointed Tom Ridge as my Homeland Security Advisor . As Governor Ridge has worked with all levels of government to prepare a national strategy , and as we have learned more about the plans and capabilities of the terrorist network , we have concluded that our government must be reorganized to deal more effectively with the new threats of the 21st century . So tonight , I ask the Congress to join me in creating a single , permanent department with an overriding and urgent mission securing the homeland of America , and protecting the American people . Right now , as many as a hundred different government agencies have some responsibilities for homeland security , and no one has final accountability . For example , the Coast Guard has several missions , from search and rescue to maritime treaty enforcement . It reports to the Transportation Department , whose primary responsibilities are roads , rails , bridges and the airways . The Customs Service , among other duties , collects tariffs and prevents smuggling and it is part of the Treasury Department , whose primary responsibility is fiscal policy , not security . Tonight , I propose a permanent Cabinet level Department of Homeland Security to unite essential agencies that must work more closely together Among them , the Coast Guard , the Border Patrol , the Customs Service , Immigration officials , the Transportation Security Administration , and the Federal Emergency Management Agency . Employees of this new agency will come to work every morning knowing their most important job is to protect their fellow citizens . The Department of Homeland Security will be charged with The Department of Homeland Security will be charged with four primary tasks . This new agency will control our borders and prevent terrorists and explosives from entering our country . It will work with state and local authorities to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies . It will bring together our best scientists to develop technologies that detect biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons , and to discover the drugs and treatments to best protect our citizens . And this new department will review intelligence and law enforcement information from all agencies of government , and produce a single daily picture of threats against our homeland . Analysts will be responsible for imagining the worst , and planning to counter it . The reason to create this department is not to create the size of government , but to increase its focus and effectiveness . The staff of this new department will be largely drawn from the agencies we are combining . By ending duplication and overlap , we will spend less on overhead , and more on protecting America . This reorganization will give the good people of our government their best opportunity to succeed by organizing our resources in a way that is thorough and unified . What I am proposing tonight is the most extensive reorganization of the federal government since the 1940s . During his presidency , Harry Truman recognized that our nation s fragmented defenses had to be reorganized to win the Cold War . He proposed uniting our military forces under a single Department of Defense , and creating the National Security Council to bring together defense , intelligence , and diplomacy . Truman s reforms are still helping us to fight terror abroad , and now we need similar dramatic reforms to secure our people at home . Only the United States Congress can create a new department of government . So tonight , I ask for your help in encouraging your representatives to support my plan . We face an urgent need , and we must move quickly , this year , before the end of the congressional session . All in our government have learned a great deal since September the 11th , and we must act on every lesson . We are stronger and better prepared tonight than we were on that terrible morning and with your help , and the support of Congress , we will be stronger still . History has called our nation into action . History has placed a great challenge before us Will America with our unique position and power blink in the face of terror , or will we lead to a freer , more civilized world There is only one answer This great country will lead the world to safety , security , peace and freedom . Thank you for listening . Good night , and may God bless America .<speech_sep>Secretary General , President , distinguished delegates , and ladies and gentlemen We meet one year and one day after a terrorist attack brought grief to my country , and brought grief to many citizens of our world . Yesterday , we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning . Today , we turn to the urgent duty of protecting other lives , without illusion and without fear . We have accomplished much in the last year in Afghanistan and beyond . We have much yet to do in Afghanistan and beyond . Many nations represented here have joined in the fight against global terror , and the people of the United States are grateful . The United Nations was born in the hope that survived a world war the hope of a world moving toward justice , escaping old patterns of conflict and fear . The founding members resolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will and wickedness of any man . We created the United Nations Security Council , so that , unlike the League of Nations , our deliberations would be more than talk , our resolutions would be more than wishes . After generations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives , we dedicated ourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all , and to a system of security defended by all . Today , these standards , and this security , are challenged . Our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease . The suffering is great , and our responsibilities are clear . The United States is joining with the world to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives , to extend trade and the prosperity it brings , and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed . As a symbol of our commitment to human dignity , the United States will return to UNESC This organization has been reformed and America will participate fully in its mission to advance human rights and tolerance and learning . Our common security is challenged by regional conflicts ethnic and religious strife that is ancient , but not inevitable . In the Middle East , there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides . America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine , living side by side with Israel in peace and security . Like all other people , Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices . My nation will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict . Above all , our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions . In the attacks on America a year ago , we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies . This threat hides within many nations , including my own . In cells and camps , terrorists are plotting further destruction , and building new bases for their war against civilization . And our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massive scale . In one place in one regime we find all these dangers , in their most lethal and aggressive forms , exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations was born to confront . Twelve years ago , Iraq invaded Kuwait without provocation . And the regime s forces were poised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources . Had Saddam Hussein been appeased instead of stopped , he would have endangered the peace and stability of the world . Yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will of the United Nations . To suspend hostilities , to spare himself , Iraq s dictator accepted a series of commitments . The terms were clear , to him and to all . And he agreed to prove he is complying with every one of those obligations . He has proven instead only his contempt for the United Nations , and for all his pledges . By breaking every pledge by his deceptions , and by his cruelties Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself . In 1991 , Security Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once the repression of its own people , including the systematic repression of minorities which the Council said , threatened international peace and security in the region . This demand goes ignored . Last year , the Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq continues to commit extremely grave violations of human rights , and that the regime s repression is all pervasive . Tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment , summary execution , and torture by beating and burning , electric shock , starvation , mutilation , and rape . Wives are tortured in front of their husbands , children in the presence of their parents and all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state . In 1991 , the Security Council , through Resolutions 686 and 687 , demanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands . Iraq s regime agreed . It broke its promise . Last year the Secretary General s high level coordinator for this issue reported that Kuwait , Saudi , Indian , Syrian , Lebanese , Iranian , Egyptian , Bahraini , and Omani nationals remain unaccounted for more than 600 people . One American pilot is among them . In 1991 , the Security Council , through Resolution 687 , demanded that Iraq renounce all involvement with terrorism , and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq . Iraq s regime agreed . It broke this promise . In violation of Security Council Resolution 1373 , Iraq continues to shelter and support terrorist organizations that direct violence against Iran , Israel , and Western governments . Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for murder . In 1993 , Iraq attempted to assassinate the Emir of Kuwait and a former American President . Iraq s government openly praised the attacks of September the 11th . And al Qaeda terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and are known to be in Iraq . In 1991 , the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles , and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorous inspections . Iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge . From 1991 to 1995 , the Iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons . After a senior official in its weapons program defected and exposed this lie , the regime admitted to producing tens of thousands of liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with Scud warheads , aerial bombs , and aircraft spray tanks . inspectors believe Iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents it declared , and has failed to account for more than three metric tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons . Right now , Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons . United Nations inspections also revealed that Iraq likely maintains stockpiles of Vmustard and other chemical agents , and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical weapons . And in 1995 , after four years of deception , Iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclear weapons program prior to the Gulf War . We know now , were it not for that war , the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993 . Today , Iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program weapons design , procurement logs , experiment data , an accounting of nuclear materials and documentation of foreign assistance . Iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians . It retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon . Iraq has made several attempts to buy high strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon . Should Iraq acquire fissile material , it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year . And Iraq s state controlled media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear scientists , leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons . Iraq also possesses a force of Scud type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometers permitted by the Work at testing and production facilities shows that Iraq is building more long range missiles that it can inflict mass death throughout the region . In 1990 , after Iraq s invasion of Kuwait , the world imposed economic sanctions on Iraq . Those sanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime s compliance with Security Council resolutions . In time , Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food . Saddam Hussein has subverted this program , working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials . He blames the suffering of Iraq s people on the United Nations , even as he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for himself , and to buy arms for his country . By refusing to comply with his own agreements , he bears full guilt for the hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens . In 1991 , Iraq promised inspectors immediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq s commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles . Iraq broke this promise , spending seven years deceiving , evading , and harassing inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely . Just months after the 1991 cease fire , the Security Council twice renewed its demand that the Iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors , condemning Iraq s serious violations of its obligations . The Security Council again renewed that demand in 1994 , and twice more in 1996 , deploring Iraq s clear violations of its obligations . The Security Council renewed its demand three more times in 1997 , citing flagrant violations and three more times in 1998 , calling Iraq s behavior totally unacceptable . And in 1999 , the demand was renewed yet again . As we meet today , it is been almost four years since the last inspectors set foot in Iraq , four years for the Iraqi regime to plan , and to build , and to test behind the cloak of secrecy . We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were in his country . Are we to assume that he stopped when they left The history , the logic , and the facts lead to one conclusion Saddam Hussein s regime is a grave and gathering danger . To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence . To assume this regime s good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble . And this is a risk we must not take . Delegates to the General Assembly , we have been more than patient . We have tried sanctions . We have tried the carrot of oil for food , and the stick of coalition military strikes . But Saddam Hussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction . The first time we may be completely certain he has a nuclear weapons is when , God forbids , he uses one . We owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day from coming . The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations , and a threat to peace . Iraq has answered a decade of demands with a decade of defiance . All the world now faces a test , and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment . Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced , or cast aside without consequence Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding , or will it be irrelevant The United States helped found the United Nations . We want the United Nations to be effective , and respectful , and successful . We want the resolutions of the world s most important multilateral body to be enforced . And right now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime . Our partnership of nations can meet the test before us , by making clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime . If the Iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately and unconditionally forswear , disclose , and remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction , long range missiles , and all related material . If the Iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act to suppress it , as all states are required to do by Security Council resolutions . If the Iraqi regime wishes peace , it will cease persecution of its civilian population , including Shi a , Sunnis , Kurds , Turkomans , and others , again as required by Security Council resolutions . If the Iraqi regime wishes peace , it will release or account for all Gulf War personnel whose fate is still unknown . It will return the remains of any who are deceased , return stolen property , accept liability for losses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait , and fully cooperate with international efforts to resolve these issues , as required by Security Council resolutions . If the Iraqi regime wishes peace , it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil for food program . It will accept administration of funds from that program , to ensure that the money is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the Iraqi people . If all these steps are taken , it will signal a new openness and accountability in Iraq . And it could open the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a government that represents all Iraqis a government based on respect for human rights , economic liberty , and internationally supervised elections . The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people they have suffered too long in silent captivity . Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause , and a great strategic goal . The people of Iraq deserve it the security of all nations requires it . Free societies do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest , and open societies do not threaten the world with mass murder . The United States supports political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq . We can harbor no illusions and that is important today to remember . Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990 . He is fired ballistic missiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , and Israel . His regime once ordered the killing of every person between the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish villages in northern Iraq . He has gassed many Iranians , and 40 Iraqi villages . My nation will work with the Security Council to meet our common challenge . If Iraq s regime defies us again , the world must move deliberately , decisively to hold Iraq to account . We will work with the Security Council for the necessary resolutions . But the purposes of the United States should not be doubted . The Security Council resolutions will be enforced the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will be unavoidable . And a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power . Events can turn in one of two ways If we fail to act in the face of danger , the people of Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission . The regime will have new power to bully and dominate and conquer its neighbors , condemning the Middle East to more years of bloodshed and fear . The regime will remain unstable the region will remain unstable , with little hope of freedom , and isolated from the progress of our times . With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons , our own options to confront that regime will narrow . And if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies , then the attacks of September the 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors . If we meet our responsibilities , if we overcome this danger , we can arrive at a very different future . The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity . They can one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a democratic Palestine , inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim world . These nations can show by their example that honest government , and respect for women , and the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond . And we will show that the promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time . Neither of these outcomes is certain . Both have been set before us . We must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress . We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangers gather . We must stand up for our security , and for the permanent rights and the hopes of mankind . By heritage and by choice , the United States of America will make that stand . And , delegates to the United Nations , you have the power to make that stand , as well . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Fellow citizens For eight years , it has been my honor to serve as your President . The first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence a time set apart . Tonight , with a thankful heart , I have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have traveled together , and the future of our nation . Five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of American democracy . In a tradition dating back to our founding , the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you , the American people . Standing on the steps of the Capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land . This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation . And I join all Americans in offering best wishes to President Elect Obama , his wife Michelle , and their two beautiful girls . Tonight I am filled with gratitude to Vice President Cheney and members of my administration to Laura , who brought joy to this house and love to my life to our wonderful daughters , Barbara and Jenna to my parents , whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime . And above all , I thank the American people for the trust you have given me . I thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits . And I thank you for the countless acts of courage , generosity , and grace that I have witnessed these past eight years . This evening , my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this house September the 11th , 2001 . That morning , terrorists took nearly 3 , 000 lives in the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor . I remember standing in the rubble of the World Trade Center three days later , surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock . I remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke filled corridors at the Pentagon , and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard Flight 93 . I remember Arlene Howard , who gave me her fallen son s police shield as a reminder of all that was lost . And I still carry his badge . As the years passed , most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9 11 . But I never did . Every morning , I received a briefing on the threats to our nation . I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe . Over the past seven years , a new Department of Homeland Security has been created . The military , the intelligence community , and the FBI have been transformed . Our nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists movements , freeze their finances , and break up their plots . And with strong allies at our side , we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them . Afghanistan has gone from a nation where the Taliban harbored al Qaeda and stoned women in the streets to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school . Iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of America to an Arab democracy at the heart of the Middle East and a friend of the United States . There is legitimate debate about many of these decisions . But there can be little debate about the results . America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil . This is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safe law enforcement officers , intelligence analysts , homeland security and diplomatic personnel , and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces . Our nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger . I have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families . And America owes you a debt of gratitude . And to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight There has been no higher honor than serving as your Commander in Chief . The battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems . Under one , a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology , condemns women to subservience , and marks unbelievers for murder . The other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God , and that liberty and justice light the path to peace . This is the belief that gave birth to our nation . And in the long run , advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens . When people live in freedom , they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror . When people have hope in the future , they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism . So around the world , America is promoting human liberty , human rights , and human dignity . We are standing with dissidents and young democracies , providing AIDS medicine to dying patients to bring dying patients back to life , and sparing mothers and babies from malaria . And this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations . For eight years , we have also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home . Across our country , students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools . A new Medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled . Every taxpayer pays lower income taxes . The addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faith based programs . Vulnerable human life is better protected . Funding for our veterans has nearly doubled . America s air and water and lands are measurably cleaner . And the federal bench includes wise new members like Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts . When challenges to our prosperity emerged , we rose to meet them . Facing the prospect of a financial collapse , we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy . These are very tough times for hardworking families , but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted . All Americans are in this together . And together , with determination and hard work , we will restore our economy to the path of growth . We will show the world once again the resilience of America s free enterprise system . Like all who have held this office before me , I have experienced setbacks . There are things I would do differently if given the chance . Yet I have always acted with the best interests of our country in mind . I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right . You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made . But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions . The decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country , and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course . While our nation is safer than it was seven years ago , the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack . Our enemies are patient , and determined to strike again . America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict . But we have been given solemn responsibilities , and we must meet them . We must resist complacency . We must keep our resolve . And we must never let down our guard . At the same time , we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose . In the face of threats from abroad , it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward . But we must reject isolationism and its companion , protectionism . Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger . In the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad . If America does not lead the cause of freedom , that cause will not be led . As we address these challenges and others we cannot foresee tonight America must maintain our moral clarity . I have often spoken to you about good and evil , and this has made some uncomfortable . But good and evil are present in this world , and between the two of them there can be no compromise . Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time , everywhere . Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right . This nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth . We must always be willing to act in their defense and to advance the cause of peace . President Thomas Jefferson once wrote , I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past . As I leave the house he occupied two centuries ago , I share that optimism . America is a young country , full of vitality , constantly growing and renewing itself . And even in the toughest times , we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead . I have confidence in the promise of America because I know the character of our people . This is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom . This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger , and compassion in the face of suffering . We see examples of America s character all around us . And Laura and I have invited some of them to join us in the White House this evening . We see America s character in Tony Recasner , a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of Hurricane Katrina . We see it in Julio Medina , a former inmate who leads a faith based program to help prisoners returning to society . We have seen it in Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade , who charged into an ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow Marines . We see America s character in Bill Krissoff a surgeon from California . His son , Nathan a Marine gave his life in Iraq . When I met Krissoff and his family , he delivered some surprising news He told me he wanted to join the Navy Medical Corps in honor of his son . This good man was 60 years old 18 years above the age limit . But his petition for a waiver was granted , and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine . Lieutenant Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight , because he will soon deploy to Iraq , where he will help save America s wounded warriors and uphold the legacy of his fallen son . In citizens like these , we see the best of our country resilient and hopeful , caring and strong . These virtues give me an unshakable faith in America . We have faced danger and trial , and there is more ahead . But with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals , this great nation will never tire , never falter , and never fail . It has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your President . There have been good days and tough days . But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our country , and uplifted by the goodness of our people . I have been blessed to represent this nation we love . And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any other citizen of the United States of America . And so , my fellow Americans , for the final time Good night . May God bless this house and our next President . And may God bless you and our wonderful country . Thank you .<speech_sep>Thank you . Sit down . Behave yourself . You are at the White House . Laura , thank you very much for being here on this historic moment . Vice President , Secretary O Neill , Director Daniels , Secretary Evans and Chao are here , as well . Secretary Abraham , Administrator Christine Todd Whitman , Members of the United States Senate , Members of the House of Representatives , fellow Americans , welcome . Some months ago , in my speech to the joint session of Congress , I had the honor of introducing Steven Ramos to the Nation . Steven is the network administrator for a school district . His wife , Josefina , teaches at a charter school . They have a little girl named Lianna , and they are trying to save for Lianna s college education . High taxes made saving difficult . Last year they paid nearly 8 , 000 in Federal income taxes . Well , today we are beginning to make life for the Ramos a lot easier . Today we start to return some of the Ramos money and not only their money but the money of everybody who paid taxes in the United States of America . Across the board tax relief does not happen often in Washington , DIn fact , since World War Iit has happened only twice President Kennedy s tax cut in the sixties and President Reagan s tax cuts in the 1980s . And now it is happening for the third time , and it is about time . A year ago tax relief was said to be a political impossibility . Six months ago it was supposed to be a political liability . Today it becomes reality . It becomes reality because of the bipartisan leadership of the Members of the United States Congress , Members like Bill Thomas of California , Ralph Hall of Texas , Charles Grassley of Iowa , Max Baucus of Montana , Zell Miller of Georgia , John Breaux of Louisiana , Trent Lott of Mississippi and the entire leadership team in the Senate , and Denny Hastert of Illinois and the leadership team in the House of Representatives some Democrats , many Republicans who worked tirelessly and effectively to produce this important result . I also want to pay tribute to the members of my administration who worked with Congress to bring about this day Vice President Cheney , Secretary O Neill , Director Daniels , and the team inside the White House of Andy Card and Larry Lindsey , Nick Calio , and their staffs . With us today are 15 of the many families I met as I toured our country making the case for tax relief hard working Americans . I was able to talk about their stories and their struggles and their hopes , which made the case for tax relief much stronger than my words could possible convey . And I want to thank you all for coming . And here at the White House today are representatives of millions of Americans , including labor union members , small busi ness owners , and family farmers . Your persistence and determination helped bring us to this day . The American people should be proud of your efforts on their behalf , and I personally thank you all for coming . Tax relief is a great achievement for the American people . Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington , and it was produced in record time . Tax relief is an achievement for families struggling to enter the middle class . For hard working lower income families , we have cut the bottom rate of Federal income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent . We doubled the per child tax credit to 1 , 000 and made it refundable . Tax relief is compassionate , and it is now on the way . Tax relief is an achievement for middle class families squeezed by high energy prices and credit card debt . Most families can look forward to a 600 tax rebate before they have to pay the September back to school bills . And in the years ahead , taxpayers can look forward to steadily declining income tax rates . Tax relief is an achievement for families that want the Government tax policy to be fair and not penalize them for making good choices , good choices such as marriage and raising a family . So we cut the marriage penalty . Tax relief makes the code more fair for small businesses and farmers and individuals by eliminating the death tax . Over the long haul , tax relief will encourage work and innovation . It will allow American workers to save more on their pension plan or individual retirement accounts . Tax relief expands individual freedom . The money we return , or do not take in the first place , can be saved for a child s education , spent on family needs , invested in a home or in a business or a mutual fund or used to reduce personal debt . The message we send today It is up to the American people it is the American people s choice . We recognize , loud and clear , the surplus is not the Government s money . The surplus is the people s money , and we ought to trust them with their own money . This tax relief plan is principled . We cut taxes for every income tax payer . We target nobody in we target nobody out . And tax relief is now on the way . Today is a great day for America . It is the first major achievement of a new era , an era of steady cooperation . And more achievements are ahead . I thank the Members of Congress in both parties who made today possible . Together , we will lead our country to new progress and new possibilities . It is now my honor to sign the first broad tax relief in a generation .<speech_sep>My fellow citizens , events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision . For more than a decade , the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war . That regime pledged to reveal and destroy all its weapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War in 1991 . Since then , the world has engaged in 12 years of diplomacy . We have passed more than a dozen resolutions in the United Nations Security Council . We have sent hundreds of weapons inspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq . Our good faith has not been returned . The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage . It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament . Over the years , weapon inspectors have been threatened by Iraqi officials , electronically bugged , and systematically deceived . Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again because we are not dealing with peaceful men . Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised . This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq s neighbors and against Iraq s people . The regime has a history of reckless aggression in the Middle East . It has a deep hatred of America and our friends . And it has aided , trained and harbored terrorists , including operatives of al Qaeda . The danger is clear using chemical , biological or , one day , nuclear weapons , obtained with the help of Iraq , the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country , or any other . The United States and other nations did nothing to deserve or invite this threat . But we will do everything to defeat it . Instead of drifting along toward tragedy , we will set a course toward safety . Before the day of horror can come , before it is too late to act , this danger will be removed . The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security . That duty falls to me , as Commander in Chief , by the oath I have sworn , by the oath I will keep . Recognizing the threat to our country , the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against Iraq . America tried to work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully . We believe in the mission of the United Nations . One reason the was founded after the second world war was to confront aggressive dictators , actively and early , before they can attack the innocent and destroy the peace . In the case of Iraq , the Security Council did act , in the early 1990s . Under Resolutions 678 and 687 both still in effect the United States and our allies are authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction . This is not a question of authority , it is a question of will . Last September , I went to the General Assembly and urged the nations of the world to unite and bring an end to this danger . On November 8th , the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441 , finding Iraq in material breach of its obligations , and vowing serious consequences if Iraq did not fully and immediately disarm . Today , no nation can possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed . And it will not disarm so long as Saddam Hussein holds power . For the last four and a half months , the United States and our allies have worked within the Security Council to enforce that Council s long standing demands . Yet , some permanent members of the Security Council have publicly announced they will veto any resolution that compels the disarmament of Iraq . These governments share our assessment of the danger , but not our resolve to meet it . Many nations , however , do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace , and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world . The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities , so we will rise to ours . In recent days , some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part . They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq , so that disarmament can proceed peacefully . He has thus far refused . All the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end . Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours . Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , commenced at a time of our choosing . For their own safety , all foreign nationals including journalists and inspectors should leave Iraq immediately . Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a translated radio broadcast , and I have a message for them . If we must begin a military campaign , it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you . As our coalition takes away their power , we will deliver the food and medicine you need . We will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free . In a free Iraq , there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors , no more poison factories , no more executions of dissidents , no more torture chambers and rape rooms . The tyrant will soon be gone . The day of your liberation is near . It is too late for Saddam Hussein to remain in power . It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country by permitting the peaceful entry of coalition forces to eliminate weapons of mass destruction . Our forces will give Iraqi military units clear instructions on actions they can take to avoid being attacked and destroyed . I urge every member of the Iraqi military and intelligence services , if war comes , do not fight for a dying regime that is not worth your own life . And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning . In any conflict , your fate will depend on your action . Do not destroy oil wells , a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people . Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone , including the Iraqi people . War crimes will be prosecuted . War criminals will be punished . And it will be no defense to say , I was just following orders . Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation , the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war , and every measure will be taken to win it . Americans understand the costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past . War has no certainty , except the certainty of sacrifice . Yet , the only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military , and we are prepared to do so . If Saddam Hussein attempts to cling to power , he will remain a deadly foe until the end . In desperation , he and terrorists groups might try to conduct terrorist operations against the American people and our friends . These attacks are not inevitable . They are , however , possible . And this very fact underscores the reason we cannot live under the threat of blackmail . The terrorist threat to America and the world will be diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed . Our government is on heightened watch against these dangers . Just as we are preparing to ensure victory in Iraq , we are taking further actions to protect our homeland . In recent days , American authorities have expelled from the country certain individuals with ties to Iraqi intelligence services . Among other measures , I have directed additional security of our airports , and increased Coast Guard patrols of major seaports . The Department of Homeland Security is working closely with the nation s governors to increase armed security at critical facilities across America . Should enemies strike our country , they would be attempting to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear . In this , they would fail . No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the resolve of this country . We are a peaceful people yet we are not a fragile people , and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers . If our enemies dare to strike us , they and all who have aided them , will face fearful consequences . We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater . In one year , or five years , the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over . With these capabilities , Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest . We choose to meet that threat now , where it arises , before it can appear suddenly in our skies and cities . The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and undeniable realities . In the 20th century , some chose to appease murderous dictators , whose threats were allowed to grow into genocide and global war . In this century , when evil men plot chemical , biological and nuclear terror , a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never before seen on this earth . Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair notice , in formal declarations and responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self defense , it is suicide . The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now . As we enforce the just demands of the world , we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country . Unlike Saddam Hussein , we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty . And when the dictator has departed , they can set an example to all the Middle East of a vital and peaceful and self governing nation . The United States , with other countries , will work to advance liberty and peace in that region . Our goal will not be achieved overnight , but it can come over time . The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land . And the greatest power of freedom is to overcome hatred and violence , and turn the creative gifts of men and women to the pursuits of peace . That is the future we choose . Free nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting against the violent . And tonight , as we have done before , America and our allies accept that responsibility . Good night , and may God continue to bless America .<speech_sep>Thank you all . Speaker , Vice President Cheney , members of Congress , members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens Today our nation lost a beloved , graceful , courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream . Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago , and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King . Every time I am invited to this rostrum , I am humbled by the privilege and mindful of the history we have seen together . We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement . We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history , and it has been my honor to serve with you . In a system of two parties , two chambers , and two elected branches , there will always be differences and debate . But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone , and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger . To confront the great issues before us , we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another and I will do my part . Tonight the state of our union is strong , and together we will make it stronger . In this decisive year , you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country . We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom , or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life . We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy , or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity . In a complex and challenging time , the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting , yet it ends in danger and decline . The only way to protect our people , the only way to secure the peace , the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership . So the United States of America will continue to lead . Abroad , our nation is committed to an historic , long term goal We seek the end of tyranny in our world . Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism . In reality , the future security of America depends on it . On September 11 , 2001 , we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7 , 000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country . Dictatorships shelter terrorists , and feed resentment and radicalism , and seek weapons of mass destruction . Democracies replace resentment with hope , respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors , and join the fight against terror . Every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer , so we will act boldly in freedom s cause . Far from being a hopeless dream , the advance of freedom is the great story of our time . In 1945 , there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world . Today , there are 122 . And we are writing a new chapter in the story of self government with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan , and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink , and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom . At the start of 2006 , more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations . And we do not forget the other half in places like Syria and Burma , Zimbabwe , North Korea , and Iran because the demands of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom as well . No one can deny the success of freedom , but some men rage and fight against it . And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death . Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder , and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously . They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder . Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world . Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly , the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear . When they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up commuters in London or behead a bound captive , the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will , allowing the violent to inherit the Earth . But they have miscalculated We love our freedom , and we will fight to keep it . In a time of testing , we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders . If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone , they would not leave us alone . They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores . There is no peace in retreat , and there is no honor in retreat . By allowing radical Islam to work its will , by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself , we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals or even in our own courage . But our enemies and our friends can be certain The United States will not retreat from the world , and we will never surrender to evil . America rejects the false comfort of isolationism . We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe and liberated death camps and helped raise up democracies and faced down an evil empire . Once again , we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace . We remain on the offensive against terror networks . We have killed or captured many of their leaders and for the others , their day will come . We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan , where a fine President and a National Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy . We are on the offensive in Iraq with a clear plan for victory . First , we are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government , so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized . Second , we are continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy , so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom . And third , we are striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy . Iraqis are showing their courage every day , and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom . Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal . But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy . In less than three years , the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation , to sovereignty , to a Constitution , to national elections . At the same time , our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration , clearing out insurgent strongholds , and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces . I am confident in our plan for victory I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military . Fellow citizens , we are in this fight to win , and we are winning . The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home . As we make progress on the ground and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead , we should be able to further decrease our troop levels . But those decisions will be made by our military commanders , not by politicians in Washington , C . Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq . We have adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction . Along the way , we have benefitted from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of Congress of both parties . In the coming year , I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice . Yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure . Hindsight alone is not wisdom , and second guessing is not a strategy . With so much in the balance , those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor . A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison , would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country , and show that a pledge from America means little . Members of Congress , however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past , our nation has only one option We must keep our word , defeat our enemies , and stand behind the American military in this vital mission . Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear . They know what it is like to fight house to house in a maze of streets , to wear heavy gear in the desert heat , to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb . And those who know the costs also know the stakes . Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fallujah . He left behind a letter to his family , but his words could just as well be addressed to every American . Here is what Dan wrote I know what honor is it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you . I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to . Never falter . Do not hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting . Staff Sergeant Dan Clay s wife , Lisa , and his mom and dad , Sara Jo and Bud , are with us this evening . Welcome . Our nation is grateful to the fallen , who live in the memory of our country . We are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation s uniform . And as we honor our brave troops , let us never forget the sacrifices of America s military families . Our offensive against terror involves more than military action . Ultimately , the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change . So the United States of America supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East . Elections are vital , but they are only the beginning . Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law and protection of minorities and strong , accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote . The great people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty Presidential election , and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism . The Palestinian people have voted in elections , and now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel , disarm , reject terrorism , and work for lasting peace . Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts . Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens . Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity . The same is true of Iran , a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people . The regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon , and that must come to an end . The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions , and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons . America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats . Tonight let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran America respects you , and we respect your country . We respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom . And our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran . To overcome dangers in our world , we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in hopeless lands . Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies , it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need . We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV AIDS or an infant with malaria or a refugee fleeing genocide or a young girl sold into slavery . We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty , corruption , and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human trafficking and the drug trade . In recent years , you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria , expand the education of girls , and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform . For people everywhere , the United States is a partner for a better life . Shortchanging these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world , undercut our long term security , and dull the conscience of our country . I urge members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America . Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home . The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us . Fortunately , this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement , intelligence , the military , and homeland security . These men and women are dedicating their lives , protecting us all , and they deserve our support and our thanks . They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime , so I ask you to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act . It is said that prior to the attacks of September 11 , our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy . We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to Al Qaeda operatives overseas . But we did not know about their plans until it was too late . So to prevent another attack based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected Al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from America . Previous Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have , and federal courts have approved the use of that authority . Appropriate members of Congress have been kept informed . The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks . It remains essential to the security of America . If there are people inside our country who are talking with Al Qaeda , we want to know about it , because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again . In all these areas from the disruption of terror networks , to victory in Iraq , to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions we need the support of our friends and allies . To draw that support , we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act . The only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world . Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth . American leaders from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan rejected isolation and retreat , because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on the march . Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy , a war that will be fought by Presidents of both parties , who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress . And tonight I ask for yours . Together , let us protect our country , support the men and women who defend us , and lead this world toward freedom . Here at home , America also has a great opportunity We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world . Our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other major industrialized nations . In the last two and a half years , America has created 4 . 6 million new jobs more than Japan and the European Union combined . Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters , the American people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world . The American economy is preeminent , but we cannot afford to be complacent . In a dynamic world economy , we are seeing new competitors like China and India , and this creates uncertainty , which makes it easier to feed people s fears . So we are seeing some old temptations return . Protectionists want to escape competition , pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy . Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy , centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes . We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy even though this economy could not function without them . All these are forms of economic retreat , and they lead in the same direction , toward a stagnant and second rate economy . Tonight I will set out a better path An agenda for a nation that competes with confidence an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs . Americans should not fear our economic future because we intend to shape it . Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing . And our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend , save , and invest . In the last five years , the tax relief you passed has left 880 billion in the hands of American workers , investors , small businesses , and families . And they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth . Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years . If we do nothing , American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome . Because America needs more than a temporary expansion , we need more than temporary tax relief . I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make the tax cuts permanent . Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars . Every year of my Presidency , we have reduced the growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending , and last year you passed bills that cut this spending . This year my budget will cut it again , and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities . By passing these reforms , we will save the American taxpayer another 14 billion next year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 . I am pleased that members of Congress are working on earmark reform , because the federal budget has too many special interest projects . And we can tackle this problem together , if you pass the line item veto . We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending , or entitlements . This year , the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60 , including two of my dad s favorite people me and President Clinton . This milestone is more than a personal crisis it is a national challenge . The retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government . By 2030 , spending for Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget . And that will present future Congresses with impossible choices staggering tax increases , immense deficits , or deep cuts in every category of spending . Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security , yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away . And every year we fail to act , the situation gets worse . So tonight I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid . This commission should include members of Congress of both parties , and offer bipartisan solutions . We need to put aside partisan politics and work together and get this problem solved . Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow . One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade , and we want people everywhere to buy American . With open markets and a level playing field , no one can outproduce or outcompete the American worker . Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws , reflects our values , and serves the interests of our economy . Our nation needs orderly and secure borders . To meet this goal , we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection . And we must have a rational , humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty , allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally , and reduces smuggling and crime at the border . Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care . Our government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly , and we are meeting that responsibility . For all Americans , we must confront the rising cost of care , strengthen the doctor patient relationship , and help people afford the insurance coverage they need . We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology , to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors . We will strengthen health savings accounts , making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get . We will do more to make this coverage portable , so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance . And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice , leaving women in nearly 1 , 500 American counties without a single OB GYI ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year . Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy . And here we have a serious problem America is addicted to oil , which is often imported from unstable parts of the world . The best way to break this addiction is through technology . Since 2001 , we have spent nearly 10 billion to develop cleaner , cheaper , and more reliable alternative energy sources . And we are on the threshold of incredible advances . So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative a 22 percent increase in clean energy research at the Department of Energy , to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas . To change how we power our homes and offices , we will invest more in zero emission coal fired plants , revolutionary solar and wind technologies , and clean , safe nuclear energy . We must also change how we power our automobiles . We will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollution free cars that run on hydrogen . We will also fund additional research in cutting edge methods of producing ethanol , not just from corn but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass . Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years . Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal To replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025 . By applying the talent and technology of America , this country can dramatically improve our environment , move beyond a petroleum based economy , and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past . And to keep America competitive , one commitment is necessary above all We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity . Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated , hard working , ambitious people . And we are going to keep that edge . Tonight I announce an American Competitiveness Initiative , to encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our nation s children a firm grounding in math and science . First , I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years . This funding will support the work of America s most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology , supercomputing , and alternative energy sources . Second , I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit to encourage bolder private sector initiatives in technology . With more research in both the public and private sectors , we will improve our quality of life and ensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come . Third , we need to encourage children to take more math and science , and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations . We have made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act , which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country . Tonight I propose to train 70 , 000 high school teachers to lead advanced placement courses in math and science , bring 30 , 000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms , and give early help to students who struggle with math , so they have a better chance at good , high wage jobs . If we ensure that America s children succeed in life , they will ensure that America succeeds in the world . Preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share . I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative , and together we will show the world what the American people can achieve . America is a great force for freedom and prosperity . Yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries but by who we are and how we treat one another . So we strive to be a compassionate , decent , hopeful society . In recent years , America has become a more hopeful nation . Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s . Welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade . Drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001 . There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last three decades , and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row . These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation , a revolution of conscience , in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment . Government has played a role . Wise policies , such as welfare reform and drug education and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country . And everyone here tonight , Democrat and Republican , has a right to be proud of this record . Yet many Americans , especially parents , still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions . They are concerned about unethical conduct by public officials and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage . They worry about children in our society who need direction and love , and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster , and about suffering caused by treatable diseases . As we look at these challenges , we must never give in to the belief that America is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel . The American people know better than that . We have proven the pessimists wrong before , and we will do it again . A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law . The Supreme Court now has two superb new members on its bench , Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito . I thank the Senate for confirming both of them . I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law and not legislate from the bench . Today marks the official retirement of a very special American . For 24 years of faithful service to our nation , the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O Connor . A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life . Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research Human cloning in all its forms creating or implanting embryos for experiments creating human animal hybrids and buying , selling , or patenting human embryos . Human life is a gift from our Creator , and that gift should never be discarded , devalued , or put up for sale . A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust . Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington . I support your efforts . Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility , and that is a pledge we must never forget , never dismiss , and never betray . As we renew the promise of our institutions , let us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one another . A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love . Through the Helping America s Youth Initiative , we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child . And this good work is being led by our First Lady , Laura Bush . This year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school , so more of America s youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams . A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency , and stays at it until they are back on their feet . So far the federal government has committed 85 billion to the people of the gulf coast and New Orleans . We are removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees . We are providing business loans and housing assistance . Yet as we meet these immediate needs , we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived . In New Orleans and in other places , many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country . The answer is not only temporary relief but schools that teach every child and job skills that bring upward mobility and more opportunities to own a home and start a business . As we recover from a disaster , let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice , equal in hope , and rich in opportunity . A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV AIDwhich can be prevented and treated and defeated . More than a million Americans live with HIand half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans . I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act and provide new funding to States , so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America . We will also lead a nationwide effort , working closely with African American churches and faith based groups , to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions , end the stigma of AIDand come closer to the day when there are no new infections in America . Fellow citizens , we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence . We have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite . We see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives . Sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc toward an unknown shore . Yet the destination of history is determined by human action , and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing . Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery . Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory over segregation . The United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe and been complicit in the oppression of others . Today , having come far in our own historical journey , we must decide Will we turn back or finish well Before history is written down in books , it is written in courage . Like Americans before us , we will show that courage , and we will finish well . We will lead freedom s advance . We will compete and excel in the global economy . We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land . And so we move forward optimistic about our country , faithful to its cause , and confident of the victories to come . May God bless America .<speech_sep>Thank you all very much . Okay . I know you all are anxious to get back to class . So please be seated . Thank you for such a warm welcome . It is great to be in the home of the Big Blue . Hamilton High School . I want to thank you all for coming . I particularly want to thank my friend , the Governor of the great state of Ohio , Governor Taft , for being here . I want to thank Tracy Miller for being so hospitable . I want to thank all who have come to witness this historic moment . For those of you who have studied the history of our government , you know most bills are signed at the White House . But I decided to sign this bill in one of the most important places in America a public school . We have got large challenges here in America . There is no greater challenge than to make sure that every child and all of us on this stage mean every child , not just a few children every single child , regardless of where they live , how they are raised , the income level of their family , every child receive a first class education in America . And as you know , we have got another challenge , and that is to protect America from evil ones . And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores here at Hamilton High School that the effort that this great country is engaged in , the effort to defend freedom and to defend our people , the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists , is noble and just and right , and your great country will prevail in this effort . I long for peace . But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror , that your children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that is as free as the society we have today . Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next . It is a gift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children . And we owe the children of America a good education . And today begins a new era , a new time in public education in our country . As of this hour , America s schools will be on a new path of reform , and a new path of results . Our schools will have higher expectations . We believe every child can learn . Our schools will have greater resources to help meet those goals . Parents will have more information about the schools , and more say in how their children are educated . From this day forward , all students will have a better chance to learn , to excel , and to live out their dreams . I want to thank the Secretary of Education , Rod Paige , for being here and for his leadership . I asked Rod to join my administration because I wanted somebody who understood what it meant to run a school district in Washington , C . I did not need somebody that based his knowledge on theory I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on experience . And Rod was a teacher , a school board member , and the Superintendent of the Houston Independent School District . He did a fine job there , and he is doing a fine job in Washington . Reaching this moment has not been easy , as you could tell from Chairman Boehner s discussion . But we made it , because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what was right for America . We made it because proud members of the House and the Senate , loyal to their parties , decided to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for America . I want to thank George Miller . I call him Big George , Jorge el Grande . As John mentioned , George and I are not from the same political ideology except when I met with George in Austin , I could tell he shares the same passion I share for making sure that every child gets educated . And he , like me and others , realize that a system that simply shuffles children through the schools is a system that is going to leave people behind . And so we made up our minds right then and there to do something about it . I appreciate so very much my friend , Judd Gregg , from the state of New Hampshire , being here . He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary . I still invited him to come with me . After here , we are going to New Hampshire . I look forward to singing Judd s praises because he is a solid , solid United States senator honest , full of integrity , and like the others here , he buckled down to do what was right for the children . And then , of course , there is Senator Edward Kennedy . And the folks at the Crawford Coffee Shop would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow . He is a fabulous United States senator . When he is against you , it is tough . When he is with you , it is a great experience . And I am signing this bill here because it is the home of the Chairman , John Boehner . John did a really good job . He shepherded the process . He made sure people showed up for the meetings . He was dogged in his determination to get this bill done . It would not have happened without his leadership . And all four of these members up here need to be proud of the legacy they have left behind . This is a good bill for the American children , and I am proud to sign it in their presence . There are other members of the Congress who are here , as well , and I want to thank them for coming . Senator Evan Bayh from the state of Indiana , is here . Evan , thank you for your leadership on education reform . Senator Mike DeWine of your state of Ohio , who helped author who helped to author the safe and drug free schools part of this bill . Thank you for your leadership . Steve Chabot of Ohio , Van Hilleary of Tennessee thank you both for coming , as well . In that box is the bill . I do not intend to read it all . It is not exactly light reading . But if you were to read it all , you would find that it contains some very important principles that will help guide our public school system for the next decades . First principle is accountability . Every school has a job to do . And that is to teach the basics and teach them well . If we want to make sure no child is left behind , every child must learn to read . And every child must learn to add and subtract . So in return for federal dollars , we are asking states to design accountability systems to show parents and teachers whether or not children can read and write and add and subtract in grades three through eight . The fundamental principle of this bill is that every child can learn , we expect every child to learn , and you must show us whether or not every child is learning . I read a quote one time from a young lady in New York . She said , I do not ever remember taking an exam . They just kept passing me along . I ended up dropping out in the 7th grade . I basically felt nobody cared . The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories of America . Let us just move them through . It is so much easier to move a child through than trying to figure out how to solve a child s problems . The first step to making sure that a child is not shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write , or add and subtract . The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it . And so , what this bill says , it says every child can learn . And we want to know early , before it is too late , whether or not a child has a problem in learning . I understand taking tests are not fun . Too bad . We need to know in America . We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education . No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance . No longer is it acceptable to keep results away from parents . One of the interesting things about this bill , it says that we are never going to give up on a school that is performing poorly that when we find poor performance , a school will be given time and incentives and resources to correct their problems . A school will be given time to try other methodologies , perhaps other leadership , to make sure that people can succeed . If , however , schools do not perform , if , however , given the new resources , focused resources , they are unable to solve the problem of not educating their children , there must be real consequences . There must be a moment in which parents can say , I have had enough of this school . Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order to make sure reform is meaningful . And so , therefore , this bill s second principle is , is that we trust parents to make the right decisions for their children . Any school that does not perform , any school that cannot catch up and do its job , a parent will have these options a better public school , a tutor , or a charter school . We do not want children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach . The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achieve standards , to meet the standards . In Washington , there is some smart people there , but the people who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton . The people who care most about the children in this school are the teachers and parents and school board members . And therefore , schools not only have the responsibility to improve , they now have the freedom to improve . The federal government will not micromanage how schools are run . We believe strongly we believe strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people . And so the new role of the federal government is to set high standards , provide resources , hold people accountable , and liberate school districts to meet the standards . I cannot think of any better way to say to teachers , we trust you . And , first of all , we have got to thank all the teachers who are here . I thank you for teaching . Yours is indeed a noble profession . And our society is better off because you decided to teach . And by saying we trust local folks , we are really saying we trust you . We trust you . We want you to have as much flexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom can succeed . So thank you for what you do . And a fourth principle is that we are going to spend more money , more resources , but they will be directed at methods that work . Not feel good methods , not sound good methods , but methods that actually work . Particularly when it comes to reading . We are going to spend more on our schools , and we are going to spend it more wisely . If we have learned anything over the last generations , money alone does not make a good school . It certainly helps . But as John mentioned , we have spent billions of dollars with lousy results . So now it is time to spend billions of dollars and get good results . As John mentioned , too many of our kids cannot read . You know , a huge percentage of children in poverty cannot read at grade level . That is not right in America . We are going to win the war overseas , and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home , as well . And so this bill so this bill focuses on reading . It sets a grand goal for the country . Our children will be reading by the third grade . That is not an impossible goal . It is a goal we must meet if we want every child to succeed . And so , therefore , we tripled the amount of federal funding for scientifically based early reading programs . We have got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teach what works . We have got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction . There are no more excuses , as far as I am concerned , about not teaching children how to read . We know what works . The money is now available , and it is up to each local district to make sure it happens . It is up to you , the citizens of Hamilton , to make sure no child is left behind . And the federal government can spend money and we can help set standards , and we can assist upon accountability . But the truth of the matter is our schools will flourish when citizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind . This is the end of a legislative process . Signing this bill is the end of a long , long time of people sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences . It is a great symbol of what is possible in Washington when good people come together to do what is right . But it is just the beginning of change . And now it is up to you , the local citizens of our great land , the compassionate , decent citizens of America , to stand up and demand high standards , and to demand that no child not one single child in America is left behind . Thank you for letting us come . May God bless .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President Cheney , members of Congress , distinguished citizens and fellow citizens Every year , by law and by custom , we meet here to consider the state of the Union . This year , we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead . You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence . During this session of Congress , we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country . We have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease . We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared , and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people . In all these days of promise and days of reckoning , we can be confident . In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril , our faith is sure our resolve is firm and our Union is strong . This country has many challenges . We will not deny , we will not ignore , we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses , to other Presidents , and other generations . We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage . During the last two years , we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together . To lift the standards of our public schools , we achieved historic education reform , which must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life . To protect our country , we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security , which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era . To bring our economy out of recession , we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation . To insist on integrity in American business , we passed tough reforms , and we are holding corporate criminals to account . Some might call this a good record . I call it a good start . Tonight I ask the House and the Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens . Our first goal is clear We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job . After recession , terrorist attacks , corporate scandals , and stock market declines , our economy is recovering . Yet , it is not growing fast enough or strongly enough . With unemployment rising , our nation needs more small businesses to open , more companies to invest and expand , more employers to put up the sign that says , Help Wanted . Jobs are created when the economy grows . The economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest , and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place . I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year . And under my plan , as soon as I have signed the bill , this extra money will start showing up in workers paychecks . Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty , we should do it now . Instead of slowly raising the child credit to 1 , 000 , we should send the checks to American families now . The tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes , and it will help our economy immediately 92 million Americans will keep , this year , an average of almost 1 , 100 more of their own money a family of four with an income of 40 , 000 would see their federal income taxes fall from 1 , 178 to 45 per year our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses . You , the Congress , have already passed all these reductions and promised them for future years . If this tax relief is good for Americans three , or five , or seven years from now , it is even better for Americans today . We should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws . It is fair to tax a company s profits . It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits . To boost investor confidence and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income , I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends . Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand . More jobs mean more taxpayers and higher revenues to our government . The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in Washington , C . We must work together to fund only our most important priorities . I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year , about as much as the average family s income is expected to grow . And that is a good benchmark for us . Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families . A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will be crucial to the future of Social Security . As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable , we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own . Our second goal is high quality , affordable health for all Americans . The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation , with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives . Yet for many people , medical care costs too much , and many have no health coverage at all . These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care . Instead , we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy , choose their own doctors , and seniors and low income Americans receive the help they need . Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers and HMOs , we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of American medicine . Health care reform must begin with Medicare . Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society . We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America . Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is . And just like you , the members of Congress , and your staffs and other federal employees , all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs . My budget will commit an additional 400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare . Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare . I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year . To improve our health care system , we must address one of the prime causes of higher cost , the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued . Because of excessive litigation , everybody pays more for health care , and many parts of America are losing fine doctors . No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit . I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform . Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country , while dramatically improving the environment . I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation , to develop cleaner technology , and to produce more energy at home . I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from powerplants over the next 15 years . I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative , to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities , kill wildlife , and burn away millions of acres of treasured forests . I urge you to pass these measures , for the good of both our environment and our economy . Even more , I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined . In this century , the greatest environmental progress will come about not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations but through technology and innovation . Tonight I am proposing 1 . 2 billion in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean , hydrogen powered automobiles . A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy , which can be used to power a car , producing only water , not exhaust fumes . With a new national commitment , our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom , so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution free . Join me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy . Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America . For so many in our country , the homeless and the fatherless , the addicted , the need is great . Yet there is power , wonder working power , in the goodness and idealism and faith of the American people . Americans are doing the work of compassion every day , visiting prisoners , providing shelter for battered women , bringing companionship to lonely seniors . These good works deserve our praise . They deserve our personal support , and when appropriate , they deserve the assistance of the federal government . I urge you to pass both my Faith Based Initiative and the Citizen Service Act , to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America , one heart and one soul at a time . Last year , I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom Corps , which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America . Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens , boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad . I propose a 450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners . Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors . Yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need . One mentor , one person can change a life forever , and I urge you to be that one person . Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs . Addiction crowds out friendship , ambition , moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire . As a government , we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs . Yet for those already addicted , the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives . Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it . So tonight I propose a new 600 million program to help an additional 300 , 000 Americans receive treatment over the next three years . Our nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work . One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge , Louisiana . A man in the program said , God does miracles in people s lives , and you never think it could be you . Tonight let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope The miracle of recovery is possible , and it could be you . By caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who need treatment , we are building a more welcoming society , a culture that values every life . And in this work , we must not overlook the weakest among us . I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of partial birth abortion . And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment , I ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning . The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad . The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests . Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity , the rights of every person , and the possibilities of every life . This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peace and confound the designs of evil men . In Afghanistan , we helped to liberate an oppressed people . And we will continue helping them secure their country , rebuild their society , and educate all their children , boys and girls . In the Middle East , we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine . Across the Earth , America is feeding the hungry . More than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the United States . As our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer , we must also remember our calling as a blessed country is to make the world better . Today , on the continent of Africa , nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus , including three million children under the age 15 . There are whole countries in Africa where more than one third of the adult population carries the infection . More than four million require immediate drug treatment . Yet across that continent , only 50 , 000 AIDS victims only 50 , 000 are receiving the medicine they need . Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence , many do not seek treatment . Almost all who do are turned away . A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration . He says , We have no medicines . Many hospitals tell people , You have got AIDWe cannot help you . Go home and die . In an age of miraculous medicines , no person should have to hear those words . AIDS can be prevented . Antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years . And the cost of those drugs has dropped from 12 , 000 a year to under 300 a year , which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp . Ladies and gentlemen , seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many . We have confronted and will continue to confront HIV AIDS in our own country . And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad , tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa . This comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new AIDS infections , treat at least two million people with life extending drugs , and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and for children orphaned by AIDI ask the Congress to commit 15 billion over the next five years , including nearly 10 billion in new money , to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean . This nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature . And this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the manmade evil of international terrorism . There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror . There is never a day when I do not learn of another threat or receive reports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers . The war goes on , and we are winning . To date , we have arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaeda . They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September 11 attacks , the chief of Al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east Africa and the S . Cole , an Al Qaeda operations chief from Southeast Asia , a former director of Al Qaida s training camps in Afghanistan , a key Al Qaeda operative in Europe , a major Al Qaeda leader in Yemen . All told , more than 3 , 000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries . Many others have met a different fate . Let us put it this way They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies . We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks . America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the embassy in Yemen , the American embassy in Singapore , a Saudi military base , ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Gibraltar . We have broken Al Qaeda cells in Hamburg , Milan , Madrid , London , Paris , as well as Buffalo , New York . We have the terrorists on the run . We are keeping them on the run . One by one , the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice . As we fight this war , we will remember where it began Here , in our own country . This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland . We have intensified security at the borders and ports of entry , posted more than 50 , 000 newly trained federal screeners in airports , begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox , and are deploying the nation s first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack . And this year , for the first time , we are beginning to field a defense to protect this nation against ballistic missiles . I thank the Congress for supporting these measures . I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism , called Project BioShield . The budget I send you will propose almost 6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax , botulinum toxin , Ebola , and plague . We must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons , and we must act before the dangers are upon us . Since September 11 , our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists . The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence and is transforming itself to meet new threats . Tonight I am instructing the leaders of the FBthe CIthe Homeland Security , and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center , to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location . Our government must have the very best information possible , and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens . Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power . In the ruins of two towers , at the western wall of the Pentagon , on a field in Pennsylvania , this nation made a pledge , and we renew that pledge tonight Whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties , we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men free people will set the course of history . Today , the gravest danger in the war on terror , the gravest danger facing America and the world , is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons . These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail , terror , and mass murder . They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies , who would use them without the least hesitation . This threat is new . America s duty is familiar . Throughout the 20th century , small groups of men seized control of great nations , built armies and arsenals , and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world . In each case , their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit . In each case , the ambitions of Hitlerism , militarism , and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples , by the strength of great alliances , and by the might of the United States of America . Now , in this century , the ideology of power and domination has appeared again and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror . Once again , this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos and constant alarm . Once again , we are called to defend the safety of our people and the hopes of all mankind . And we accept this responsibility . America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers . We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm . We are strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world . We are working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction . In all these efforts , however , America s purpose is more than to follow a process it is to achieve a result , the end of terrible threats to the civilized world . All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks . And we are asking them to join us , and many are doing so . Yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others . Whatever action is required , whenever action is necessary , I will defend the freedom and security of the American people . Different threats require different strategies . In Iran , we continue to see a government that represses its people , pursues weapons of mass destruction , and supports terror . We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy . Iranians , like all people , have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny , and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom . On the Korean Peninsula , an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation . Throughout the 1990s , the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons . We now know that that regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along . And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions . America and the world will not be blackmailed . America is working with the countries of the region , South Korea , Japan , China , and Russia , to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation , economic stagnation , and continued hardship . The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions . Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq . A brutal dictator , with a history of reckless aggression , with ties to terrorism , with great potential wealth , will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States . Twelve years ago , Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost . To spare himself , he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction . For the next 12 years , he systematically violated that agreement . He pursued chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons , even while inspectors were in his country . Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons , not economic sanctions , not isolation from the civilized world , not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities . Almost three months ago , the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm . He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations and for the opinion of the world . The 108 inspectors were sent to conduct were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California . The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq s regime is disarming . It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons , lay those weapons out for the world to see , and destroy them as directed . Nothing like this has happened . The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25 , 000 liters of anthrax , enough doses to kill several million people . He has not accounted for that material . He is given no evidence that he has destroyed it . The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38 , 000 liters of botulinum toxin , enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure . He has not accounted for that material . He is given no evidence that he has destroyed it . Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin , mustard , and VX nerve agent . In such quantities , these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands . He is not accounted for these materials . He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them . intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30 , 000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents . Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them , despite Iraq s recent declaration denying their existence . Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29 , 984 of these prohibited munitions . He is given no evidence that he has destroyed them . From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq , in the late 1990s , had several mobile biological weapons labs . These are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors . Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities . He is given no evidence that he has destroyed them . The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program , had a design for a nuclear weapon , and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb . The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production . Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities . He clearly has much to hide . The dictator of Iraq is not disarming . To the contrary , he is deceiving . From intelligence sources we know , for instance , that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the inspectors , sanitizing inspection sites , and monitoring the inspectors themselves . Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses . Iraq is blocking U 2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations . Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview . Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say . Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed , along with their families . Year after year , Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths , spent enormous sums , taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction . But why The only possible explanation , the only possible use he could have for those weapons , is to dominate , intimidate , or attack . With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons , Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region . And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat . Evidence from intelligence sources , secret communications , and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists , including members of Al Qaeda . Secretly and without fingerprints , he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own . Before September 11 , many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained . But chemical agents , lethal viruses , and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained . Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans , this time armed by Saddam Hussein . It would take one vial , one canister , one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known . We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes . Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent . Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions , politely putting us on notice before they strike If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge , all actions , all words , and all recriminations would come too late . Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy , and it is not an option . The dictator who is assembling the world s most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages , leaving thousands of his own citizens dead , blind , or disfigured . Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained , by torturing children while their parents are made to watch . International human rights groups have cataloged other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq electric shock , burning with hot irons , dripping acid on the skin , mutilation with electric drills , cutting out tongues , and rape . If this is not evil , then evil has no meaning . And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq Your enemy is not surrounding your country your enemy is ruling your country . And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation . The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm . America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies . The United States will ask the Security Council to convene on February 5 to consider the facts of Iraq s ongoing defiance of the world . Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi s legal Iraq s illegal weapons programs , its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors , and its links to terrorist groups . We will consult . But let there be no misunderstanding If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm , for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world , we will lead a coalition to disarm him . Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace , members of the American armed forces Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East , and some crucial hours may lay ahead . In those hours , the success of our cause will depend on you . Your training has prepared you . Your honor will guide you . You believe in America , and America believes in you . Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can make . The technologies of war have changed the risks and suffering of war have not . For the brave Americans who bear the risk , no victory is free from sorrow . This nation fights reluctantly , because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come . We seek peace . We strive for peace . And sometimes peace must be defended . A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all . If war is forced upon us , we will fight in a just cause and by just means , sparing , in every way we can , the innocent . And if war is forced upon us , we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military , and we will prevail . And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan , we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom . Many challenges , abroad and at home , have arrived in a single season . In two years , America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril , from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes . And we go forward with confidence , because this call of history has come to the right country . Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time . Adversity has revealed the character of our country , to the world and to ourselves . America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength . We exercise power without conquest , and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers . Americans are a free people , who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation . The liberty we prize is not America s gift to the world , it is God s gift to humanity . We Americans have faith in ourselves , but not in ourselves alone . We do not know we do not claim to know all the ways of providence , yet we can trust in them , placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life and all of history . May He guide us now . And may God continue to bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . Speaker , Vice President Cheney , members of Congress , distinguished guests , fellow citizens As we gather tonight , our nation is at war our economy is in recession and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers . Yet , the state of our Union has never been stronger . We last met in an hour of shock and suffering . In four short months , our nation has comforted the victims , begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon , rallied a great coalition , captured , arrested , and rid the world of thousands of terrorists , destroyed Afghanistan s terrorist training camps , saved a people from starvation , and freed a country from brutal oppression . The American flag flies again over our embassy in Kabul . Terrorists who once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay . And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own . America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror . We will be partners in rebuilding that country . And this evening we welcomed the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan , Chairman Hamid Karzai . The last time we met in this chamber , the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes , forbidden from working or going to school . Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan s new government . And we welcome the new Minister of Women s Affairs , Sima Samar . Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people , to the resolve of our coalition , and to the might of the United States military . When I called our troops into action , I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill . And tonight , thanks to them , we are winning the war on terror . The men and women of our armed forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United States Even 7 , 000 miles away , across oceans and continents , on mountaintops and in caves , you will not escape the justice of this nation . For many Americans , these four months have brought sorrow and pain that will never completely go away . Every day a retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero to feel closer to his two sons who died there . At a memorial in New York , a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father Dear Daddy , please take this to heaven . I do not want to play football until I can play with you again some day . Last month , at the grave of her husband , Micheal , a CIA officer and marine who died in Mazar e Sharif , Shannon Spann said these words of farewell , Semper Fi , my love . Shannon is with us tonight . Shannon , I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just , and our country will never forget the debt we owe Micheal and all who gave their lives for freedom . Our cause is just , and it continues . Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears and showed us the true scope of the task ahead . We have seen the depth of our enemies hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of innocent life . And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design . We have found diagrams of American nuclear powerplants and public water facilities , detailed instructions for making chemical weapons , surveillance maps of American cities , and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the world . What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that , far from ending there , our war against terror is only beginning . Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on September 11 were trained in Afghanistan s camps , and so were tens of thousands of others . Thousands of dangerous killers , schooled in the methods of murder , often supported by outlaw regimes , are now spread throughout the world like ticking timebombs , set to go off without warning . Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners , hundreds of terrorists have been arrested . Yet , tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large . These enemies view the entire world as a battlefield , and we must pursue them wherever they are . So long as training camps operate , so long as nations harbor terrorists , freedom is at risk . And America and our allies must not and will not allow it . Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives . First , we will shut down terrorist camps , disrupt terrorist plans , and bring terrorists to justice . And second , we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world . Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business , yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries . A terrorist underworld , including groups like Hamas , Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad , Jaish e Mohammed , operates in remote jungles and deserts and hides in the centers of large cities . While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan , America is acting elsewhere . We now have troops in the Philippines , helping to train that country s armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an American and still hold hostages . Our soldiers , working with the Bosnian government , seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy . Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia . My hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own . Many nations are acting forcefully . Pakistan is now cracking down on terror , and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf . But some governments will be timid in the face of terror . And make no mistake about it If they do not act , America will . Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction . Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September 11 , but we know their true nature . North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens . Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror , while an unelected few repress the Iranian people s hope for freedom . Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror . The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade . This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens , leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children . This is a regime that agreed to international inspections , then kicked out the inspectors . This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world . States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world . By seeking weapons of mass destruction , these regimes pose a grave and growing danger . They could provide these arms to terrorists , giving them the means to match their hatred . They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States . In any of these cases , the price of indifference would be catastrophic . We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials , technology , and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction . We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack . And all nations should know America will do what is necessary to ensure our nation s security . We will be deliberate yet , time is not on our side . I will not wait on events while dangers gather . I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer . The United States of America will not permit the world s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world s most destructive weapons . Our war on terror is well begun , but it is only begun . This campaign may not be finished on our watch yet , it must be and it will be waged on our watch . We cannot stop short . If we stop now , leaving terror camps intact and terrorist states unchecked , our sense of security would be false and temporary . History has called America and our allies to action , and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom s fight . Our first priority must always be the security of our nation , and that will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress . My budget supports three great goals for America We will win this war we will protect our homeland and we will revive our economy . September 11 brought out the best in America and the best in this Congress . And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve . Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home . I am a proud member of my party . Yet as we act to win the war , protect our people , and create jobs in America , we must act , first and foremost , not as Republicans , not as Democrats but as Americans . It costs a lot to fight this war . We have spent more than 1 billion a month , over 30 million a day , and we must be prepared for future operations . Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives , and we need more of them . We need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely . Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons , the best equipment , the best training , and they also deserve another pay raise . My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades , because while the price of freedom and security is high , it is never too high . Whatever it costs to defend our country , we will pay . The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack . Time and distance from the events of September 11 will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons . America is no longer protected by vast oceans . We are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad and increased vigilance at home . My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security , focused on four key areas bioterrorism , emergency response , airport and border security , and improved intelligence . We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases . We will increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters . We will improve intelligence collection and sharing , expand patrols at our borders , strengthen the security of air travel , and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States . Homeland security will make America not only stronger but , in many ways , better . Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health . Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods . Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs . And as government works to better secure our homeland , America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens . A few days before Christmas , an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match . The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man , who had been trained by Al Qaeda and was armed with explosives . The people on that plane were alert and , as a result , likely saved nearly 200 lives . And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and Christina Jones . Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security , the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the American people . To achieve these great national objectives to win the war , protect the homeland , and revitalize our economy our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term , so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner . We have clear priorities , and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas . We will prevail in the war , and we will defeat this recession . Americans who have lost their jobs need our help , and I support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage . Yet , American workers want more than unemployment checks they want a steady paycheck . When America works , America prospers , so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word jobs . Good jobs begin with good schools , and here we have made a fine start . Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind . I was proud to work with members of both parties Chairman John Boehner and Congressman George Miller Senator Judd Gregg . And I was so proud of our work , I even had nice things to say about my friend Ted Kennedy . I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop could not believe I had say such a thing but our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results . There is more to do . We need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood development programs . We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for America , a quality teacher in every classroom . Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy . This Congress must act to encourage conservation , promote technology , build infrastructure , and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil . Good jobs depend on expanded trade . Selling into new markets creates new jobs , so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority . On these two key issues , trade and energy , the House of Representatives has acted to create jobs , and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation . Good jobs depend on sound tax policy . Last year , some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small some thought it was too big . But when the checks arrived in the mail , most Americans thought tax relief was just about right . Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates , doubling the child credit , and ending the death tax . For the sake of long term growth and to help Americans plan for the future , let us make these tax cuts permanent . The way out of this recession , the way to create jobs , is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend . For the sake of American workers , let us pass a stimulus package . Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform . As we reauthorize these important reforms , we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job . Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security . I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients bill of rights , to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage , to approve an historic increase in the spending for veterans health , and to give seniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs . A good job should lead to security in retirement . I ask Congress to enact new safeguards for 401K and pension plans . Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails . Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements , corporate America must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct . Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social Security , and we will . We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them . Members , you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues productive farm policy a cleaner environment broader homeownership , especially among minorities and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith based groups . I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we have applied to our war against terrorism . During these last few months , I have been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing . Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic , that we would splinter in fear and selfishness . They were as wrong as they are evil . The American people have responded magnificently , with courage and compassion , strength and resolve . As I have met the heroes , hugged the families , and looked into the tired faces of rescuers , I have stood in awe of the American people . And I hope you will join me I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis , our First Lady , Laura Bush . None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September 11 . Yet , after America was attacked , it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves . We were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other , to our country , and to history . We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do . For too long our culture has said , If it feels good , do it . Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed , Let us roll . In the sacrifice of soldiers , the fierce brotherhood of firefighters , and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens , we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like . We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self . We have been offered a unique opportunity , and we must not let this moment pass . My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two years , 4 , 000 hours over the rest of your lifetime , to the service of your neighbors and your nation . Many are already serving , and I thank you . If you are not sure how to help , I have got a good place to start . To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America , I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps . The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need responding in case of crisis at home rebuilding our communities and extending American compassion throughout the world . One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security . America needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies , volunteers to help police and fire departments , transportation and utility workers well trained in spotting danger . Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities . We need mentors to love children , especially children whose parents are in prison . And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools . USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200 , 000 new volunteers . And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world . So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps , double its volunteers over the next five years , and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world . This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity , a moment we must seize to change our culture . Through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness , I know we can overcome evil with greater good . And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace . All fathers and mothers , in all societies , want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence . No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police . If anyone doubts this , let them look to Afghanistan , where the Islamic street greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration . Let the skeptics look to Islam s own rich history , with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress . America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere . No nation owns these aspirations , and no nation is exempt from them . We have no intention of imposing our culture . But America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the power of the state respect for women private property free speech equal justice and religious tolerance . America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world , including the Islamic world , because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment . We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror . In this moment of opportunity , a common danger is erasing old rivalries . America is working with Russia and China and India , in ways we have never before , to achieve peace and prosperity . In every region , free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives . Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia and Africa to Latin America , we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom . The last time I spoke here , I expressed the hope that life would return to normal . In some ways , it has . In others , it never will . Those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them . We have come to know truths that we will never question Evil is real , and it must be opposed . Beyond all differences of race or creed , we are one country , mourning together and facing danger together . Deep in the American character , there is honor , and it is stronger than cynicism . And many have discovered again that even in tragedy especially in tragedy God is near . In a single instant , we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty , that we have been called to a unique role in human events . Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential . Our enemies send other people s children on missions of suicide and murder . They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed . We stand for a different choice , made long ago on the day of our founding . We affirm it again today . We choose freedom and the dignity of every life . Steadfast in our purpose , we now press on . We have known freedom s price . We have shown freedom s power . And in this great conflict , my fellow Americans , we will see freedom s victory . Thank you all . May God bless .<speech_sep>Speaker , President Pro Tempore , members of Congress , and fellow Americans In the normal course of events , Presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the Union . Tonight , no such report is needed . It has already been delivered by the American people . We have seen it in the courage of passengers , who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer . And would you please help me to welcome his wife , Lisa Beamer , here tonight . We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers , working past exhaustion . We have seen the unfurling of flags , the lighting of candles , the giving of blood , the saying of prayers in English , Hebrew , and Arabic . We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own . My fellow citizens , for the last nine days , the entire world has seen for itself the state of our Union and it is strong . Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom . Our grief has turned to anger , and anger to resolution . Whether we bring our enemies to justice , or bring justice to our enemies , justice will be done . I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time . All of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol , singing God Bless America . And you did more than sing you acted , by delivering 40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military . Speaker Hastert , Minority Leader Gephardt , Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott , I thank you for your friendship , for your leadership and for your service to our country . And on behalf of the American people , I thank the world for its outpouring of support . America will never forget the sounds of our National Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace , on the streets of Paris , and at Berlin s Brandenburg Gate . We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul , or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo . We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America . Laura Bush attends a joint session of Congress in which President Bush praised the efforts of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and named Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge to a newly created cabinet level position in which he will oversee the homeland defense initiatives . White House photo by Paul Morse . Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own dozens of Pakistanis more than 130 Israelis more than 250 citizens of India men and women from El Salvador , Iran , Mexico and Japan and hundreds of British citizens . America has no truer friend than Great Britain . Once again , we are joined together in a great cause so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity of purpose with America . Thank you for coming , friend . On September the 11th , enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country . Americans have known wars but for the past 136 years , they have been wars on foreign soil , except for one Sunday in 1941 . Americans have known the casualties of war but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning . Americans have known surprise attacks but never before on thousands of civilians . All of this was brought upon us in a single day and night fell on a different world , a world where freedom itself is under attack . Americans have many questions tonight . Americans are asking Who attacked our country The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda . They are the same murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya , and responsible for bombing the USS Cole . Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime . But its goal is not making money its goal is remaking the world and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere . The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam . The terrorists directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews , to kill all Americans , and make no distinction among military and civilians , including women and children . This group and its leader a person named Osama bin Laden are linked to many other organizations in different countries , including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan . There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries . They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan , where they are trained in the tactics of terror . They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction . The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country . In Afghanistan , we see al Qaeda s vision for the world . Afghanistan s people have been brutalized many are starving and many have fled . Women are not allowed to attend school . You can be jailed for owning a television . Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate . A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough . The United States respects the people of Afghanistan after all , we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid but we condemn the Taliban regime . It is not only repressing its own people , it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists . By aiding and abetting murder , the Taliban regime is committing murder . And tonight , the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land . Release all foreign nationals , including American citizens , you have unjustly imprisoned . Protect foreign journalists , diplomats and aid workers in your country . Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan , and hand over every terrorist , and every person in their support structure , to appropriate authorities . Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps , so we can make sure they are no longer operating . These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion . The Taliban must act , and act immediately . They will hand over the terrorists , or they will share in their fate . I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world . We respect your faith . It is practiced freely by many millions of Americans , and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends . Its teachings are good and peaceful , and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah . The terrorists are traitors to their own faith , trying , in effect , to hijack Islam itself . The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends it is not our many Arab friends . Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists , and every government that supports them . Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda , but it does not end there . It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found , stopped and defeated . Americans are asking , why do they hate us They hate what we see right here in this chamber a democratically elected government . Their leaders are self appointed . They hate our freedoms our freedom of religion , our freedom of speech , our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other . They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries , such as Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Jordan . They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East . They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa . These terrorists kill not merely to end lives , but to disrupt and end a way of life . With every atrocity , they hope that America grows fearful , retreating from the world and forsaking our friends . They stand against us , because we stand in their way . We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety . We have seen their kind before . They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century . By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions by abandoning every value except the will to power they follow in the path of fascism , and Nazism , and totalitarianism . And they will follow that path all the way , to where it ends in history s unmarked grave of discarded lies . Americans are asking How will we fight and win this war We will direct every resource at our command every means of diplomacy , every tool of intelligence , every instrument of law enforcement , every financial influence , and every necessary weapon of war to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network . This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago , with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion . It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago , where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat . Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes . Americans should not expect one battle , but a lengthy campaign , unlike any other we have ever seen . It may include dramatic strikes , visible on Tand covert operations , secret even in success . We will starve terrorists of funding , turn them one against another , drive them from place to place , until there is no refuge or no rest . And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism . Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make . Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists . From this day forward , any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . Our nation has been put on notice We are not immune from attack . We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans . Today , dozens of federal departments and agencies , as well as state and local governments , have responsibilities affecting homeland security . These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level . So tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet level position reporting directly to me the Office of Homeland Security . And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort , to strengthen American security a military veteran , an effective governor , a true patriot , a trusted friend Pennsylvania s Tom Ridge . He will lead , oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism , and respond to any attacks that may come . These measures are essential . But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it , eliminate it , and destroy it where it grows . Many will be involved in this effort , from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty . All deserve our thanks , and all have our prayers . And tonight , a few miles from the damaged Pentagon , I have a message for our military Be ready . I have called the Armed Forces to alert , and there is a reason . The hour is coming when America will act , and you will make us proud . This is not , however , just America s fight . And what is at stake is not just America s freedom . This is the world s fight . This is civilization s fight . This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism , tolerance and freedom . We ask every nation to join us . We will ask , and we will need , the help of police forces , intelligence services , and banking systems around the world . The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded with sympathy and with support . Nations from Latin America , to Asia , to Africa , to Europe , to the Islamic world . Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the world An attack on one is an attack on all . The civilized world is rallying to America s side . They understand that if this terror goes unpunished , their own cities , their own citizens may be next . Terror , unanswered , can not only bring down buildings , it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments . And you know what we are not going to allow it . Americans are asking What is expected of us I ask you to live your lives , and hug your children . I know many citizens have fears tonight , and I ask you to be calm and resolute , even in the face of a continuing threat . I ask you to uphold the values of America , and remember why so many have come here . We are in a fight for our principles , and our first responsibility is to live by them . No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith . I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions . Those who want to give can go to a central source of information , libertyunites . org , to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation , and I ask you to give it . I ask for your patience , with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security and for your patience in what will be a long struggle . I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy . Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity . They did not touch its source . America is successful because of the hard work , and creativity , and enterprise of our people . These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th , and they are our strengths today . And , finally , please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families , for those in uniform , and for our great country . Prayer has comforted us in sorrow , and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead . Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do . And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress , I thank you , their representatives , for what you have already done and for what we will do together . Tonight , we face new and sudden national challenges . We will come together to improve air safety , to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights , and take new measures to prevent hijacking . We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying , with direct assistance during this emergency . We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home . We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act , and find them before they strike . We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America s economy , and put our people back to work . Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers Governor George Pataki , and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani . As a symbol of America s resolve , my administration will work with Congress , and these two leaders , to show the world that we will rebuild New York City . After all that has just passed all the lives taken , and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them it is natural to wonder if America s future is one of fear . Some speak of an age of terror . I know there are struggles ahead , and dangers to face . But this country will define our times , not be defined by them . As long as the United States of America is determined and strong , this will not be an age of terror this will be an age of liberty , here and across the world . Great harm has been done to us . We have suffered great loss . And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment . Freedom and fear are at war . The advance of human freedom the great achievement of our time , and the great hope of every time now depends on us . Our nation this generation will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future . We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts , by our courage . We will not tire , we will not falter , and we will not fail . It is my hope that in the months and years ahead , life will return almost to normal . We will go back to our lives and routines , and that is good . Even grief recedes with time and grace . But our resolve must not pass . Each of us will remember what happened that day , and to whom it happened . We will remember the moment the news came where we were and what we were doing . Some will remember an image of a fire , or a story of rescue . Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever . And I will carry this It is the police shield of a man named George Howard , who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others . It was given to me by his mom , Arlene , as a proud memorial to her son . This is my reminder of lives that ended , and a task that does not end . I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it . I will not yield I will not rest I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people . The course of this conflict is not known , yet its outcome is certain . Freedom and fear , justice and cruelty , have always been at war , and we know that God is not neutral between them . Fellow citizens , we will meet violence with patient justice assured of the rightness of our cause , and confident of the victories to come . In all that lies before us , may God grant us wisdom , and may He watch over the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>Good morning . The global devastation of HIV AIDS staggers the imagination and shocks the conscience . The disease has already killed over 20 million people and it is poised to kill at least 40 million more . In Africa , the disease clouds the future of entire nations and threatens to hold back the hopes of an entire continent . In the hardest hit countries of sub Sahara Africa as much as one third of the adult population is infected with HIand 10 percent or more of the school teachers will die of AIDS within five years . The wasted human lives that lie behind these numbers are a call to action for every person on the planet and for every government . So , today , my administration is announcing another important new initiative in the fight against HIV AIDS . I want to thank Secretary Powell and Secretary O Neill for their hard work on this project . I appreciate so very much Tommy Thompson , Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for he and his staff s vision and implementation , procedures for this project . I want to thank Andrew Natsios , the Administrator of USAII appreciate Tony Fauci , the Director of NIfor being here , as well , of the Allergy and Infectious Diseases Department . Thank you , Tony , for your hard work on this . I appreciate Senator Bill Frist and Senator Jesse Helms , for their vision on this issue . And I appreciate Jim Kolbe , from the House of Representatives . Thank you all for being here today . One of our best opportunities for progress against AIDS lies in preventing mothers from passing on the HIV virus to their children . Worldwide , close to 2 , 000 babies are infected with HIV every day , during pregnancy , birth or through breast feeding . Most of those infected will die before their 5th birthday . The ones who are not infected will grow up as orphans when their parents die of AIDNew advances in medical treatment give us the ability to save many of these young lives . And we must , and we will . Today I announce that my administration plans to make 500 million available to prevent mother to child transmission of HIThis new effort , which will be funded during the next 16 months , will allow us to treat one million women annually , and reduce mother to child transmission by 40 percent within five years or less in target countries . I thank all the members of Congress who supported this initiative , especially Senators Frist and Helms . Their visionary leadership on this issue will mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of children . Our initiative will focus on 12 countries in Africa and others in the Caribbean where the problem is most severe and where our help can make the greatest amount of difference . We will pursue medical strategies that have a proven track record . We will define specific goals . We will demand effective management . When the lives of babies and mothers are at stake , the only measure of compassion is real results . We have a three part strategy . First , in places with stronger health care systems , we will provide voluntary testing , prevention , counseling , and a comprehensive therapy of anti retroviral medications for both mother and child , beginning before delivery , and continuing after delivery . This combination has proven extremely effective in preventing transmission of the HIV virus . Second , in places with weaker health care systems , we will provide testing and counseling , and we will support programs that administer a single dose of nevirapine to the mother at the time of delivery , and at least one dose to the infant shortly after birth . This therapy reduces the chances of infection by nearly 50 percent . Third , and most importantly , we will make a major effort to improve the health care delivery systems in targeted countries . This will allow more women and babies to receive the comprehensive therapy . It will allow for better and longer treatment and care of all AIDS victims . And it will lead to better health care in general for all the country s citizens . We will help build better health care systems by pairing hospitals in America and hospitals in Africa , so that African hospitals can gain more expertise in administering effective AIDS programs . We will also send volunteer medical professionals from the United States to assist and train their African counterparts . And we will recruit and pay African medical and graduate students to provide testing , treatment and care . This major commitment of my government to prevent mother to child HIV transmission is the first of this scale by any government , anywhere . In time , we will gain valuable experience , improve treatment methods , and sharpen our training strategies . Health care systems in targeted countries will get better . And this will make even more progress possible . And as we see what works , we will make more funding available . The United States already contributes approximately a billion dollars a year to international efforts to combat HIV AIDIn addition , we plan to spend more than 2 . 5 billion on research and development for new drugs and new treatments . We have committed 500 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and other infectious diseases , and we stand ready to commit more as this fund demonstrates its success . Today s initiative is not a substitute for any of these efforts . It is not a substitute for further contributions to the Global Fund . This initiative will complement those efforts , and it is an essential new step in our global struggle against AIDS . Today , I call on other industrialized nations and international organizations to join this crucial effort to save children from disease and death . Medical science gives us the power to save these young lives . Conscience demands we do so . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>
