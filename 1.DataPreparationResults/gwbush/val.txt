Good evening . Three days ago , in large numbers , Iraqis went to the polls to choose their own leaders a landmark day in the history of liberty . In the coming weeks , the ballots will be counted , a new government formed , and a people who suffered in tyranny for so long will become full members of the free world . This election will not mean the end of violence . But it is the beginning of something new constitutional democracy at the heart of the Middle East . And this vote 6 , 000 miles away , in a vital region of the world means that America has an ally of growing strength in the fight against terror . All who had a part in this achievement Iraqis , and Americans and our coalition partners can be proud . Yet our work is not done . There is more testing and sacrifice before us . I know many Americans have questions about the cost and direction of this war . So tonight I want to talk to you about how far we have come in Iraq , and the path that lies ahead . From this office , nearly three years ago , I announced the start of military operations in Iraq . Our coalition confronted a regime that defied United Nations Security Council resolutions , violated a cease fire agreement , sponsored terrorism , and possessed , we believed , weapons of mass destruction . After the swift fall of Baghdad , we found mass graves filled by a dictator we found some capacity to restart programs to produce weapons of mass destruction , but we did not find those weapons . It is true that Saddam Hussein had a history of pursuing and using weapons of mass destruction . It is true that he systematically concealed those programs , and blocked the work of weapons inspectors . It is true that many nations believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction . But much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong . As your President , I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq . Yet it was right to remove Saddam Hussein from power . He was given an ultimatum and he made his choice for war . And the result of that war was to rid a the world of a murderous dictator who menaced his people , invaded his neighbors , and declared America to be his enemy . Saddam Hussein , captured and jailed , is still the same raging tyrant only now without a throne . His power to harm a single man , woman , or child is gone forever . And the world is better for it . Since the removal of Saddam , this war , like other wars in our history , has been difficult . The mission of American troops in urban raids and desert patrols , fighting Saddam loyalists and foreign terrorists , has brought danger and suffering and loss . This loss has caused sorrow for our whole nation and it has led some to ask if we are creating more problems than we are solving . That is an important question , and the answer depends on your view of the war on terror . If you think the terrorists would become peaceful if only America would stop provoking them , then it might make sense to leave them alone . This is not the threat I see . I see a global terrorist movement that exploits Islam in the service of radical political aims a vision in which books are burned , and women are oppressed , and all dissent is crushed . Terrorist operatives conduct their campaign of murder with a set of declared and specific goals to de moralize free nations , to drive us out of the Middle East , to spread an empire of fear across that region , and to wage a perpetual war against America and our friends . These terrorists view the world as a giant battlefield and they seek to attack us wherever they can . This has attracted al Qaeda to Iraq , where they are attempting to frighten and intimidate America into a policy of retreat . The terrorists do not merely object to American actions in Iraq and elsewhere , they object to our deepest values and our way of life . And if we were not fighting them in Iraq , in Afghanistan , in Southeast Asia , and in other places , the terrorists would not be peaceful citizens , they would be on the offense , and headed our way . September the 11th , 2001 required us to take every emerging threat to our country seriously , and it shattered the illusion that terrorists attack us only after we provoke them . On that day , we were not in Iraq , we were not in Afghanistan , but the terrorists attacked us anyway and killed nearly 3 , 000 men , women , and children in our own country . My conviction comes down to this We do not create terrorism by fighting the terrorists . We invite terrorism by ignoring them . And we will defeat the terrorists by capturing and killing them abroad , removing their safe havens , and strengthening new allies like Iraq and Afghanistan in the fight we share . The work in Iraq has been especially difficult more difficult than we expected . Reconstruction efforts and the training of Iraqi security forces started more slowly than we hoped . We continue to see violence and suffering , caused by an enemy that is determined and brutal , unconstrained by conscience or the rules of war . Some look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude that the war is lost , and not worth another dime or another day . I do not believe that . Our military commanders do not believe that . Our troops in the field , who bear the burden and make the sacrifice , do not believe that America has lost . And not even the terrorists believe it . We know from their own communications that they feel a tightening noose , and fear the rise of a democratic Iraq . The terrorists will continue to have the coward s power to plant roadside bombs and recruit suicide bombers . And you will continue to see the grim results on the evening news . This proves that the war is difficult it does not mean that we are losing . Behind the images of chaos that terrorists create for the cameras , we are making steady gains with a clear objective in view . America , our coalition , and Iraqi leaders are working toward the same goal a democratic Iraq that can defend itself , that will never again be a safe haven for terrorists , and that will serve as a model of freedom for the Middle East . We have put in place a strategy to achieve this goal a strategy I have been discussing in detail over the last few weeks . This plan has three critical elements . First , our coalition will remain on the offense finding and clearing out the enemy , transferring control of more territory to Iraqi units , and building up the Iraqi security forces so they can increasingly lead the fight . At this time last year , there were only a handful of Iraqi army and police battalions ready for combat . Now , there are more than 125 Iraqi combat battalions fighting the enemy , more than 50 are taking the lead , and we have transferred more than a dozen military bases to Iraqi control . Second , we are helping the Iraqi government establish the institutions of a unified and lasting democracy , in which all of Iraq s people are included and represented . Here also , the news is encouraging . Three days ago , more than 10 million Iraqis went to the polls including many Sunni Iraqis who had boycotted national elections last January . Iraqis of every background are recognizing that democracy is the future of the country they love and they want their voices heard . One Iraqi , after dipping his finger in the purple ink as he cast his ballot , stuck his finger in the air and said This is a thorn in the eyes of the terrorists . Another voter was asked , Are you Sunni or Shia And he responded , I am Iraqi . Third , after a number of setbacks , our coalition is moving forward with a reconstruction plan to revive Iraq s economy and infrastructure and to give Iraqis confidence that a free life will be a better life . Today in Iraq , seven in 10 Iraqis say their lives are going well , and nearly two thirds expect things to improve even more in the year ahead . Despite the violence , Iraqis are optimistic and that optimism is justified . In all three aspects of our strategy security , democracy , and reconstruction we have learned from our experiences , and fixed what has not worked . We will continue to listen to honest criticism , and make every change that will help us complete the mission . Yet there is a difference between honest critics who recognize what is wrong , and defeatists who refuse to see that anything is right . Defeatism may have its partisan uses , but it is not justified by the facts . For every scene of destruction in Iraq , there are more scenes of rebuilding and hope . For every life lost , there are countless more lives reclaimed . And for every terrorist working to stop freedom in Iraq , there are many more Iraqis and Americans working to defeat them . My fellow citizens Not only can we win the war in Iraq , we are winning the war in Iraq . It is also important for every American to understand the consequences of pulling out of Iraq before our work is done . We would abandon our Iraqi friends and signal to the world that America cannot be trusted to keep its word . We would undermine the morale of our troops by betraying the cause for which they have sacrificed . We would cause the tyrants in the Middle East to laugh at our failed resolve , and tighten their repressive grip . We would hand Iraq over to enemies who have pledged to attack us and the global terrorist movement would be emboldened and more dangerous than ever before . To retreat before victory would be an act of recklessness and dishonor , and I will not allow it . We are approaching a new year , and there are certain things all Americans can expect to see . We will see more sacrifice from our military , their families , and the Iraqi people . We will see a concerted effort to improve Iraqi police forces and fight corruption . We will see the Iraqi military gaining strength and confidence , and the democratic process moving forward . As these achievements come , it should require fewer American troops to accomplish our mission . I will make decisions on troop levels based on the progress we see on the ground and the advice of our military leaders not based on artificial timetables set by politicians in Washington . Our forces in Iraq are on the road to victory and that is the road that will take them home . In the months ahead , all Americans will have a part in the success of this war . Members of Congress will need to provide resources for our military . Our men and women in uniform , who have done so much already , will continue their brave and urgent work . And tonight , I ask all of you listening to carefully consider the stakes of this war , to realize how far we have come and the good we are doing , and to have patience in this difficult , noble , and necessary cause . I also want to speak to those of you who did not support my decision to send troops to Iraq I have heard your disagreement , and I know how deeply it is felt . Yet now there are only two options before our country victory or defeat . And the need for victory is larger than any president or political party , because the security of our people is in the balance . I do not expect you to support everything I do , but tonight I have a request Do not give in to despair , and do not give up on this fight for freedom . Americans can expect some things of me , as well . My most solemn responsibility is to protect our nation , and that requires me to make some tough decisions . I see the consequences of those decisions when I meet wounded servicemen and women who cannot leave their hospital beds , but summon the strength to look me in the eye and say they would do it all over again . I see the consequences when I talk to parents who miss a child so much but tell me he loved being a soldier , he believed in his mission , and , President , finish the job . I know that some of my decisions have led to terrible loss and not one of those decisions has been taken lightly . I know this war is controversial yet being your President requires doing what I believe is right and accepting the consequences . And I have never been more certain that America s actions in Iraq are essential to the security of our citizens , and will lay the foundation of peace for our children and grandchildren . Next week , Americans will gather to celebrate Christmas and Hanukkah . Many families will be praying for loved ones spending this season far from home in Iraq , Afghanistan , and other dangerous places . Our nation joins in those prayers . We pray for the safety and strength of our troops . We trust , with them , in a love that conquers all fear , in a light that reaches the darkest corners of the Earth . And we remember the words of the Christmas carol , written during the Civil War God is not dead , nor He sleep the Wrong shall fail , the Right prevail , with peace on Earth , goodwill to men . Thank you , and good night .<speech_sep>Thanks for coming , thanks for the warm welcome , thanks for joining me as I make this important announcement an announcement that I believe will make America a more compassionate and more humane and stronger country . I appreciate members of my Cabinet who have joined me today , starting with our Secretary of State , Colin Powell . I am honored that our Attorney General , John Ashcroft , has joined us . Secretary of Commerce , Don Evans . Secretary Tom Ridge , of the Department of Homeland Security . El Embajador of Mexico , Tony Garza . I thank all the other members of my administration who have joined us today . I appreciate the members of Congress who have taken time to come Senator Larry Craig , Congressman Chris Cannon , and Congressman Jeff Flake . I am honored you all have joined us , thank you for coming . I appreciate the members of citizen groups who have joined us today . Chairman of the Hispanic Alliance for Progress , Manny Lujan . Gil Moreno , the President and CEO of the Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans . Roberto De Posada , the President of the Latino Coalition . And Hector Flores , the President of LULAC . Thank you all for joining us . Many of you here today are Americans by choice , and you have followed in the path of millions . And over the generations we have received energetic , ambitious , optimistic people from every part of the world . By tradition and conviction , our country is a welcoming society . America is a stronger and better nation because of the hard work and the faith and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants . Every generation of immigrants has reaffirmed the wisdom of remaining open to the talents and dreams of the world . And every generation of immigrants has reaffirmed our ability to assimilate newcomers which is one of the defining strengths of our country . During one great period of immigration between 1891 and 1920 our nation received some 18 million men , women and children from other nations . The hard work of these immigrants helped make our economy the largest in the world . The children of immigrants put on the uniform and helped to liberate the lands of their ancestors . One of the primary reasons America became a great power in the 20th century is because we welcomed the talent and the character and the patriotism of immigrant families . The contributions of immigrants to America continue . About 14 percent of our nation s civilian workforce is foreign born . Most begin their working lives in America by taking hard jobs and clocking long hours in important industries . Many immigrants also start businesses , taking the familiar path from hired labor to ownership . As a Texan , I have known many immigrant families , mainly from Mexico , and I have seen what they add to our country . They bring to America the values of faith in God , love of family , hard work and self reliance the values that made us a great nation to begin with . We have all seen those values in action , through the service and sacrifice of more than 35 , 000 foreign born men and women currently on active duty in the United States military . One of them is Master Gunnery Sergeant Guadalupe Denogean , an immigrant from Mexico who has served in the Marine Corps for 25 years and counting . Last year , I was honored and proud to witness Sergeant Denogean take the oath of citizenship in a hospital where he was recovering from wounds he received in Iraq . I am honored to be his Commander in Chief , I am proud to call him a fellow American . As a nation that values immigration , and depends on immigration , we should have immigration laws that work and make us proud . Yet today we do not . Instead , we see many employers turning to the illegal labor market . We see millions of hard working men and women condemned to fear and insecurity in a massive , undocumented economy . Illegal entry across our borders makes more difficult the urgent task of securing the homeland . The system is not working . Our nation needs an immigration system that serves the American economy , and reflects the American Dream . Reform must begin by confronting a basic fact of life and economics some of the jobs being generated in America s growing economy are jobs American citizens are not filling . Yet these jobs represent a tremendous opportunity for workers from abroad who want to work and fulfill their duties as a husband or a wife , a son or a daughter . Their search for a better life is one of the most basic desires of human beings . Many undocumented workers have walked mile after mile , through the heat of the day and the cold of the night . Some have risked their lives in dangerous desert border crossings , or entrusted their lives to the brutal rings of heartless human smugglers . Workers who seek only to earn a living end up in the shadows of American life fearful , often abused and exploited . When they are victimized by crime , they are afraid to call the police , or seek recourse in the legal system . They are cut off from their families far away , fearing if they leave our country to visit relatives back home , they might never be able to return to their jobs . The situation I described is wrong . It is not the American way . Out of common sense and fairness , our laws should allow willing workers to enter our country and fill jobs that Americans have are not filling . We must make our immigration laws more rational , and more humane . And I believe we can do so without jeopardizing the livelihoods of American citizens . Our reforms should be guided by a few basic principles . First , America must control its borders . Following the attacks of September the 11th , 2001 , this duty of the federal government has become even more urgent . And we are fulfilling that duty . For the first time in our history , we have consolidated all border agencies under one roof to make sure they share information and the work is more effective . We are matching all visa applicants against an expanded screening list to identify terrorists and criminals and immigration violators . This month , we have begun using advanced technology to better record and track aliens who enter our country and to make sure they leave as scheduled . We have deployed new gamma and x ray systems to scan cargo and containers and shipments at ports of entry to America . We have significantly expanded the Border Patrol with more than a thousand new agents on the borders , and 40 percent greater funding over the last two years . We are working closely with the Canadian and Mexican governments to increase border security . America is acting on a basic belief our borders should be open to legal travel and honest trade our borders should be shut and barred tight to criminals , to drug traders , to drug traffickers and to criminals , and to terrorists . Second , new immigration laws should serve the economic needs of our country . If an American employer is offering a job that American citizens are not willing to take , we ought to welcome into our country a person who will fill that job . Third , we should not give unfair rewards to illegal immigrants in the citizenship process or disadvantage those who came here lawfully , or hope to do so . Fourth , new laws should provide incentives for temporary , foreign workers to return permanently to their home countries after their period of work in the United States has expired . Today , I ask the Congress to join me in passing new immigration laws that reflect these principles , that meet America s economic needs , and live up to our highest ideals . I propose a new temporary worker program that will match willing foreign workers with willing American employers , when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs . This program will offer legal status , as temporary workers , to the millions of undocumented men and women now employed in the United States , and to those in foreign countries who seek to participate in the program and have been offered employment here . This new system should be clear and efficient , so employers are able to find workers quickly and simply . All who participate in the temporary worker program must have a job , or , if not living in the United States , a job offer . The legal status granted by this program will last three years and will be renewable but it will have an end . Participants who do not remain employed , who do not follow the rules of the program , or who break the law will not be eligible for continued participation and will be required to return to their home . Under my proposal , employers have key responsibilities . Employers who extend job offers must first make every reasonable effort to find an American worker for the job at hand . Our government will develop a quick and simple system for employers to search for American workers . Employers must not hire undocumented aliens or temporary workers whose legal status has expired . They must report to the government the temporary workers they hire , and who leave their employ , so that we can keep track of people in the program , and better enforce immigration laws . There must be strong workplace enforcement with tough penalties for anyone , for any employer violating these laws . Undocumented workers now here will be required to pay a one time fee to register for the temporary worker program . Those who seek to join the program from abroad , and have complied with our immigration laws , will not have to pay any fee . All participants will be issued a temporary worker card that will allow them to travel back and forth between their home and the United States without fear of being denied re entry into our country . This program expects temporary workers to return permanently to their home countries after their period of work in the United States has expired . And there should be financial incentives for them to do so . I will work with foreign governments on a plan to give temporary workers credit , when they enter their own nation s retirement system , for the time they have worked in America . I also support making it easier for temporary workers to contribute a portion of their earnings to tax preferred savings accounts , money they can collect as they return to their native countries . After all , in many of those countries , a small nest egg is what is necessary to start their own business , or buy some land for their family . Some temporary workers will make the decision to pursue American citizenship . Those who make this choice will be allowed to apply in the normal way . They will not be given unfair advantage over people who have followed legal procedures from the start . I oppose amnesty , placing undocumented workers on the automatic path to citizenship . Granting amnesty encourages the violation of our laws , and perpetuates illegal immigration . America is a welcoming country , but citizenship must not be the automatic reward for violating the laws of America . The citizenship line , however , is too long , and our current limits on legal immigration are too low . My administration will work with the Congress to increase the annual number of green cards that can lead to citizenship . Those willing to take the difficult path of citizenship the path of work , and patience , and assimilation should be welcome in America , like generations of immigrants before them . In the process of immigration reform , we must also set high expectations for what new citizens should know . An understanding of what it means to be an American is not a formality in the naturalization process , it is essential to full participation in our democracy . My administration will examine the standard of knowledge in the current citizenship test . We must ensure that new citizens know not only the facts of our history , but the ideals that have shaped our history . Every citizen of America has an obligation to learn the values that make us one nation liberty and civic responsibility , equality under God , and tolerance for others . This new temporary worker program will bring more than economic benefits to America . Our homeland will be more secure when we can better account for those who enter our country , instead of the current situation in which millions of people are unknown , unknown to the law . Law enforcement will face fewer problems with undocumented workers , and will be better able to focus on the true threats to our nation from criminals and terrorists . And when temporary workers can travel legally and freely , there will be more efficient management of our borders and more effective enforcement against those who pose a danger to our country . This new system will be more compassionate . Decent , hard working people will now be protected by labor laws , with the right to change jobs , earn fair wages , and enjoy the same working conditions that the law requires for American workers . Temporary workers will be able to establish their identities by obtaining the legal documents we all take for granted . And they will be able to talk openly to authorities , to report crimes when they are harmed , without the fear of being deported . The best way , in the long run , to reduce the pressures that create illegal immigration in the first place is to expand economic opportunity among the countries in our neighborhood . In a few days I will go to Mexico for the Special Summit of the Americas , where we will discuss ways to advance free trade , and to fight corruption , and encourage the reforms that lead to prosperity . Real growth and real hope in the nations of our hemisphere will lessen the flow of new immigrants to America when more citizens of other countries are able to achieve their dreams at their own home . Yet our country has always benefited from the dreams that others have brought here . By working hard for a better life , immigrants contribute to the life of our nation . The temporary worker program I am proposing today represents the best tradition of our society , a society that honors the law , and welcomes the newcomer . This plan will help return order and fairness to our immigration system , and in so doing we will honor our values , by showing our respect for those who work hard and share in the ideals of America . May God bless you all .<speech_sep>Thank you all . Thank you all very much , please be seated . Thanks for the warm welcome . Thanks for the warm weather . Yes , 28 degrees in Washington , that is right . I appreciate you sharing that with me . Sometimes it is a little hotter than that in Washington . But I am glad to be back here in Yuma . Thank you so very much for your hospitality . Thanks for your service to the country . I appreciate so very much the work you are doing day and night to protect these borders . And the American people owe you a great debt of gratitude . The Border Patrol is really an important agency . I know some people are wondering whether or not it makes sense to join the Border Patrol . My answer is , I have gotten to know the Border Patrol , I know the people serving in this fine agency I would strongly urge our fellow citizens to take a look at this profession . You are outdoors , you are working with good people , and you are making a solid contribution to the United States of America . And I want to thank you all for wearing the uniform and doing the tough work necessary , the work that the American people expect you to do . Last May , I visited this section of the border , and it was then that I talked about the need for our government to give you the manpower and resources you need to do your job . We were understaffed here . We were not using enough technology to enable those who work here to be able to do the job the American people expect . I Returned to check on the progress , to make sure that the check was not in the mail it , in fact , had been delivered . I went to a neighborhood that abuts up against the border when I was here in May . It is the place where a lot of people came charging across . One or two agents would be trying to do their job and stopping a flood of folks charging into Arizona , and they could not do the job just physically impossible . Back at this site , there is now infrastructure , there is fencing . And the amount of people trying to cross the border at that spot is down significantly . I appreciate very much Ron Colburn and Ulay Littleton . They gave me the tour . Colburn , as you know , is heading up north . He is going to miss the weather . More importantly , he is going to miss the folks he worked with down here . I appreciate both of their service , I appreciate the tour . The efforts are working this border is more secure , and America is safer as a result . Securing the border is a critical part of a strategy for comprehensive immigration reform . It is an important part of a reform that is necessary so that the Border Patrol agents down here can do their job more effectively . Congress is going to take up the legislation on immigration . It is a matter of national interest and it is a matter of deep conviction for me . I have been working to bring Republicans and Democrats together to resolve outstanding issues so that Congress can pass a comprehensive bill and I can sign it into law this year . I appreciate the hard work of Secretary Michael Chertoff , the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security . I appreciate Commissioner Ralph Basham , he is the main man in charge of Customs and Border Protection . David Aguilar , Chief of the Border Patrol is with us . David , thank you for the job you are doing . Lieutenant General Steven Blum , Chief of the National Guard Bureau . I want to thank the governor of the state of Arizona , Janet Napolitano . I appreciate you being here , Governor , thank you for taking time from the session to be down here . It means a lot when the governors take an active interest in what is going on in the borders of their respective states . I appreciate so very much Senator Jon Kyl . Kyl is one of the most respected United States senators and I am proud to be with him today and glad to give him a ride back to Washington , I might add . I appreciate members of the congressional delegation who have joined us John Shadegg Jeff Flake from Snowflake , Arizona , I want you to know and I appreciate you working on this immigration issue Congressman Trent Franks , and Congressman Harry Mitchell . I appreciate you all taking time for being with me here today , it means a lot that you had come . I want to thank Senator Tim Bee , he is the president of the Arizona State Senate , for being here . Mayor , thank you for coming . Larry Nelson , the Mayor of Yuma , Arizona . I appreciate you being here , Mayor . I do want to thank Major General David Ratacheck , the Adjutant General of the state of Arizona thank all the local and state officials and , most importantly , I want to thank the Border Patrol agents and I want to thank the National Guard folks for wearing the uniform . I am proud to be the Commander in Chief of all these units here today and I appreciate your service to the United States of America . I hope by now the American people understand the need for comprehensive immigration reform is a clear need . Illegal immigration is a serious problem you know it better than anybody . It puts pressure on the public schools and the hospitals , not only here in our border states , but states around the country . It drains the state and local budgets . I was talking to the governor about how it strained the budgets . Incarceration of criminals who are here illegally strains the Arizona budget . But there is a lot of other ways it strains the local and state budgets . It brings crime to our communities . It is a problem and we need to address it aggressively . This problem has been growing for decades , and past efforts to address it have failed . These failures helped create a perception that America was not serious about enforcing our immigration laws and that they could be broken without consequence . Past efforts at reform did not do enough to secure our nation s borders . As a result , many people have been able to sneak into this country . If you do not man your borders and do not protect your borders , people are going to sneak in , and that is what is been happening for a long time . Past efforts at reform failed to address the underlying economic reasons behind illegal immigration . People will make great sacrifices to get into this country the find jobs and provide for their families . When I was the governor of Texas I used to say family values did not stop at the Rio Grande River . People are coming here to put food on the table , and they are doing jobs Americans are not doing . And the farmers in this part of the world understand exactly what I am saying . But so do a lot of other folks around the country . People are coming to work , and many of them have no lawful way to come to America , and so they are sneaking in . Past efforts at reform also failed to provide sensible ways for employers to verify the legal status of the workers they hire . It is against the law to knowingly hire an illegal alien . And as a result , because they could not verify the legal status , it was difficult for employers to comply . It was difficult for the government to enforce the law at the work site . And , yet , it is a necessary part of a comprehensive plan . You see , the lessons of all these experiences the lesson of these experiences is clear All elements of the issue must be addressed together . You cannot address just one aspect and not be able to say to the American people that we are securing our borders . We need a comprehensive bill , and that is what I am working with members of Congress on , a comprehensive immigration bill . And now is the year to get it done . The first element , of course , is to secure this border . That is what I am down here for , to remind the American people that we are spending their taxpayer their money , taxpayers money , on securing the border . And we are making progress . This border should be open to trade and lawful immigration , and shut down to criminals and drug dealers and terrorists and coyotes and smugglers , people who prey on innocent life . We more than doubled the funding for border security since I have been the President . In other words , it is one thing to hear people come down here and talk it is another thing for people to come down and do what they say they are going to do . And I want to thank Congress for working on this issue . The funding is increasing manpower . The additional funding is increasing infrastructure , and it is increasing technology . When I landed here at the airport , the first thing I saw was an unmanned aerial vehicle . It is a sophisticated piece of equipment . You can fly it from inside a truck , and you can look at people moving at night . It is the most sophisticated technology we have , and it is down here on the border to help the Border Patrol agents do their job . We have expanded the number of Border Patrol agents from about 9 , 000 to 13 , 000 , and by the end of 2008 , we are going to have a total of more than 18 , 000 agents . I had the privilege of going to Artesia , New Mexico , to the training center . It was a fantastic experience to see the young cadets getting ready to come and wear the green of the Border Patrol . By the time we are through , we will have doubled the size of the Border Patrol . In other words , you cannot do the job the American people expect unless you got enough manpower , and we are increasing the manpower down here . This new technology is really important to basically leverage the manpower . Whether it be the technology of surveillance and communication , we are going to make sure the agents have got what is necessary to be able to establish a common picture and get information out to the field as quickly as possible so that those 18 , 000 agents , when they are finally on station , can do the job the American people expect . But manpower cannot do it alone . In other words , there has to be some infrastructure along the border to be able to let these agents do their job . And so I appreciate the fact that we have got double fencing , all weather roads , new lighting , mobile cameras . The American people have no earthly idea what is going on down here . One of the reasons I have come is to let you know , let the taxpayers know , the good folks down here are making progress . We have worked with our nation s governors to deploy 6 , 000 National Guard members to provide the Border Patrol with immediate reinforcements . In other words , it takes time to train the Border Patrol , and until they are fully trained , we have asked the Guard to come down . It is called Operation Jump Start , and the Guard down here is serving nobly . I had the chance to visit with some of the Guard , and Mayor , you will be pleased to hear they like being down here in Yuma , Arizona . They like the people , and they like the mission . More than 600 members of the Guard are serving here in the Yuma Sector . And I thank the Guard , and , equally importantly , I thank their families for standing by the men and women who wear the uniform during this particular mission . You email them back home and tell them how much I appreciate the fact they are standing by you . I appreciate very much the fact that illegal border crossings in this area are down . In the months before Operation Jump Start , an average of more than 400 people a day were apprehended trying to cross here . The number has dropped to fewer than 140 a day . In other words , one way that the Border Patrol can tell whether or not we are making progress is the number of apprehensions . When you are apprehending fewer people , it means fewer are trying to come across . And fewer are trying to come across because we are deterring people from attempting illegal border crossings in the first place . I appreciate what Colburn said he puts it this way , they are watching They see us watching them , that is what he said , and they have decided they just cannot get across . And that is part of the effort we are doing . We are saying we are going to make it harder for you , so do not try in the first place . We are seeing similar results all across the southern border . The number of people apprehended for illegally crossing our southern border is down by nearly 30 percent this year . We are making progress . And thanks for your hard work . It is hard work , but necessary work . Another important deterrent to illegal immigration is to end what was called catch and release . I know how this discouraged some of our Border Patrol agents . I talked to them personally . They worked hard to find somebody sneaking in the country , they apprehended them the next thing they know , they are back in society on our side of the border . There is nothing more discouraging than have somebody risk their life or work hard and have the fruits of their labor undermined . And that is what was happening with catch and release . In other words , we had catch people , and we had say , show up for your court date , and they would not show up for their court date . That should not surprise anybody . But that is what was happening . And the reason why that was happening is because we did not have enough beds to detain people . Now , most of the people we apprehend down here are from Mexico . About 85 percent of the illegal immigrants caught crossing into crossing this border are Mexicans crossing the southern border are Mexicans . And they are sent home within 24 hours . It is the illegal immigrants from other countries that are not that easy to send home . For many years , the government did not have enough space , and so Michael and I worked with Congress to increase the number of beds available . So that excuse was eliminated . The practice has been effectively ended . Catch and release for every non Mexican has been effectively ended . And I want to thank the Border Patrol and the leaders of the Border Patrol for allowing me to stand up and say that is the case . The reason why is not only do we have beds , we have expedited the legal process to cut the average deportation time . Now , these are non Mexican illegal aliens that we have caught trying to sneak into our country . We are making it clear to foreign governments that they must accept back their citizens who violate our immigration laws . I said we are going to effectively end catch and release , and we have . And I appreciate your hard work in doing that . The second element of a comprehensive immigration reform is a temporary worker program . You cannot fully secure the border until we take pressure off the border . And that requires a temporary worker program . It seems to make sense to me that if you have got people coming here to do jobs Americans are not doing , we need to figure out a way that they can do so in a legal basis for a temporary period of time . And that way our Border Patrol can chase the criminals and the drug runners , potential terrorists , and not have to try to chase people who are coming here to do work Americans are not doing . If you want to take the pressure off your border , have a temporary worker program . It will help not only reduce the number of people coming across the border , but it will do something about the inhumane treatment that these people are subjected to . There is a whole smuggling operation . You know this better than I do . There is a bunch of smugglers that use the individual as a piece of as a commodity . And they make money off these poor people . And they stuff them in the back of 18 wheelers . And they find hovels for them to hide in . And there is a whole industry that has sprung up . And it seems like to me that since this country respects human rights and the human condition , that it be a great contribution to eliminate this thuggery , to free these people from this kind of extortion that they go through . And one way to do so is to say you can come and work in our country for jobs Americans are not doing for a temporary period of time . The third element of a comprehensive reform is to hold employers accountable for the workers they hire . In other words , if you want to make sure that we have got a system in which people are not violating the law , then you have got to make sure we hold people to account , like employers . Enforcing immigration is a vital part of any successful reform . And so Chertoff and his department are cracking down on employers who knowingly violate the law . But not only are there coyotes smuggling people in , there are document forgers that are making a living off these people . So , in other words , people may want to comply with the law , but it is very difficult at times to verify the legal status of their employees . And so to make the work site enforcement practical on a larger scale , we have got to issue a tamper proof identification card for legal foreign workers . We must create a better system for employers to verify the he legality of the workers . In other words , we got work to do . And part of a comprehensive bill is to make sure work site enforcement is effective . Fourth , we have got to resolve the status of millions of illegal immigrants already here in the country . People who entered our country illegally should not be given amnesty . Amnesty is the forgiveness of an offense without penalty . I oppose amnesty , and I think most people in the United States Congress oppose amnesty . People say , why not have amnesty Well , the reason why is because 10 years from now you do not want to have a President having to address the next 11 million people who might be here illegally . That is why you do not want amnesty . And , secondly , we are a nation of law , and we expect people to uphold the law . So we are working closely with Republicans and Democrats to find a practical answer that lies between granting automatic citizenship to every illegal immigrant and deporting every illegal immigrant . It is impractical to take the position that , oh , we will just find the 11 million or 12 million people and send them home . It is just an impractical position it is not going to work . It may sound good . It may make nice sound bite news . It will not happen . And , therefore , we need to work together to come up with a practical solution to this problem , and I know people in Congress are working hard on this issue . Illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law , and pay their taxes , and learn the English language , and show work show that they have worked in a job for a number of years . People who meet a reasonable number of conditions and pay a penalty of time and money should be able to apply for citizenship . But approval would not be automatic , and they would have to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law . What I have described is a way for those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society and demonstrate the character that makes a good citizen . Finally , we have got to honor the tradition of the melting pot , and help people assimilate into our society by learning our history , our values and our language . Last June I created a new task force to look for ways to help newcomers assimilate and succeed in our country . Many organizations , from churches to businesses to civic associations , are working to answer this call , and I am grateful for their service . And so here are the outlines for a comprehensive immigration reform bill . It is an emotional issue , as I am sure you can imagine . People have got deep convictions . And my hope is that we can have a serious and civil and conclusive debate . And so we will continue to work with members of both political parties . I think the atmosphere up there is good right now . I think people generally want to come together and put a good bill together one , by the way , that will make your job a lot easier . It is important that we address this issue in good faith . And it is important for people to listen to everybody s positions . It is important for people not to give up , no matter how hard it looks from a legislative perspective . It is important that we get a bill done . We deserve a system that secures our borders , and honors our proud history as a nation of immigrants . And so I cannot think of a better place to come and to talk about the good work that is being done and the important work that needs to be done in Washington , C . , and that is right here in Yuma , Arizona , a place full of decent , hardworking , honorable people . May God bless you all .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President Cheney , members of Congress , fellow citizens As a new Congress gathers , all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege we have been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve . And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan , the Palestinian territories , Ukraine , and a free and sovereign Iraq . Two weeks ago , I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all . This evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world . Tonight , with a healthy , growing economy , with more Americans going back to work , with our nation an active force for good in the world the state of our union is confident and strong . Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity , by advances in medicine , and by the security purchased by our parents sacrifice . Now , as we see a little gray in the mirror or a lot of gray and we watch our children moving into adulthood , we ask the question What will be the state of their union Members of Congress , the choices we make together will answer that question . Over the next several months , on issue after issue , let us do what Americans have always done , and build a better world for our children and grandchildren . First , we must be good stewards of this economy , and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely . America s economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation . In the past four years , we have provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes , overcome a recession , opened up new markets abroad , prosecuted corporate criminals , raised homeownership to the highest level in history , and in the last year alone , the United States has added 2 . 3 million new jobs . When action was needed , the Congress delivered and the nation is grateful . Now we must add to these achievements . By making our economy more flexible , more innovative , and more competitive , we will keep America the economic leader of the world . America s prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government . I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline . So next week I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation , makes tax relief permanent , and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 . My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results , or duplicate current efforts , or do not fulfill essential priorities . The principle here is clear a taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely , or not at all . To make our economy stronger and more dynamic , we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century . Under the No Child Left Behind Act , standards are higher , test scores are on the rise , and we are closing the achievement gap for minority students . Now we must demand better results from our high schools , so every high school diploma is a ticket to success . We will help an additional 200 , 000 workers to get training for a better career , by reforming our job training system and strengthening America s community colleges . And we will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education , by increasing the size of Pell Grants . To make our economy stronger and more competitive , America must reward , not punish , the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs . Small business is the path of advancement , especially for women and minorities , so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job creators from junk lawsuits . Justice is distorted , and our economy is held back , by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year . To make our economy stronger and more productive , we must make health care more affordable , and give families greater access to good coverage , and more control over their health decisions . I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low income workers buy insurance , a community health center in every poor county , improved information technology to prevent medical errors and needless costs , association health plans for small businesses and their employees , expanded health savings accounts , and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs , and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need . To keep our economy growing , we also need reliable supplies of affordable , environmentally responsible energy . Nearly four years ago , I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation , alternative sources , a modernized electricity grid , and more production here at home , including safe , clean nuclear energy . My Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens . And my budget provides strong funding for leading edge technology from hydrogen fueled cars , to clean coal , to renewable sources such as ethanol . Four years of debate is enough I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy . All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs but they are just the beginning of our duty . To build the prosperity of future generations , we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time . Year after year , Americans are burdened by an archaic , incoherent federal tax code . I have appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom . And when their recommendations are delivered , you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro growth , easy to understand , and fair to all . America s immigration system is also outdated unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country . We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families , and deny businesses willing workers , and invite chaos at our border . It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take , that rejects amnesty , that tells us who is entering and leaving our country , and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists . One of America s most important institutions a symbol of the trust between generations is also in need of wise and effective reform . Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century , and we must honor its great purposes in this new century . The system , however , on its current path , is headed toward bankruptcy . And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security . Today , more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits , and millions more are nearing retirement and for them the system is strong and fiscally sound . I have a message for every American who is 55 or older Do not let anyone mislead you . For you , the Social Security system will not change in any way . For younger workers , the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time . Social Security was created decades ago , for a very different era . In those days people did not live as long , benefits were much lower than they are today , and a half century ago , about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits . Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen . In today s world , people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades . And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary , right now it is only about three workers and over the next few decades , that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary . With each passing year , fewer workers are paying ever higher benefits to an ever larger number of retirees . So here is the result Thirteen years from now , in 2018 , Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in . And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall , bigger than the year before . For example , in the year 2027 , the government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion to keep the system afloat and by 2033 , the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion . By the year 2042 , the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt . If steps are not taken to avert that outcome , the only solutions would be drastically higher taxes , massive new borrowing , or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other government programs . I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem like a long way off . But those dates are not so distant , as any parent will tell you . If you have a 5 year old , you are already concerned about how you will pay for college tuition 13 years down the road . If you have got children in their 20s , as some of us do , the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter . And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress . You and I share a responsibility . We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all . Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open , candid review of the options . Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees . Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages . During the 1990s , my predecessor , President Clinton , spoke of increasing the retirement age . Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits . The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated . All these ideas are on the table . I know that none of these reforms would be easy . But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty , because our children s retirement security is more important than partisan politics . I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms . I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer . We must , however , be guided by some basic principles . We must make Social Security permanently sound , not leave that task for another day . We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes . We must ensure that lower income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement . We must guarantee that there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement . And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual , so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future . As we fix Social Security , we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers . And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts . Here is how the idea works . Right now , a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today s retirees . If you are a younger worker , I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account , so you can build a nest egg for your own future . Here is why personal accounts are a better deal . Your money will grow , over time , at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security . In addition , you will be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account , if you wish , to your children or grandchildren . And best of all , the money in the account is yours , and the government can never take it away . The goal here is greater security in retirement , so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts . We will make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds . We will make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees . We will make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement . We will make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once , but rather paid out over time , as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits . And we will make sure this plan is fiscally responsible , by starting personal retirement accounts gradually , and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time , eventually permitting all workers to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts . Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees , because you already have something similar , called the Thrift Savings Plan , which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds . It is time to extend the same security , and choice , and ownership to young Americans . Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society . So many of my generation , after a long journey , have come home to family and faith , and are determined to bring up responsible , moral children . Government is not the source of these values , but government should never undermine them . Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society , it should not be re defined by activist judges . For the good of families , children , and society , I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage . Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable , we must strive to build a culture of life . Medical research can help us reach that goal , by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities and I thank Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health . To build a culture of life , we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity , not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others . We should all be able to agree on some clear standards . I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts , and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity . America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious , aggressive , and always ethical . Because courts must always deliver impartial justice , judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law , not legislate from the bench . As President , I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy , and are well qualified to serve on the bench and I have done so . The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility Every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote . Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion , we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America . Our government will continue to support faith based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places . Now we need to focus on giving young people , especially young men in our cities , better options than apathy , or gangs , or jail . Tonight I propose a three year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs , and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence . Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at risk youth , which involves parents and pastors , coaches and community leaders , in programs ranging from literacy to sports . And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady , Laura Bush . Because HIV AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives , I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention , and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease . And as we update this important law , we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases , African American men and women . Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice , we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice . In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit so we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction . Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases , because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side . Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger , and protected by peace . We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy and chief among them is freedom from fear . In the three and a half years since September 11 , 2001 , we have taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans . We have created a new department of government to defend our homeland , focused the FBI on preventing terrorism , begun to reform our intelligence agencies , broken up terror cells across the country , expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack , improved border security , and trained more than a half million first responders . Police and firefighters , air marshals , researchers , and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer , and we thank them all . Our nation , working with allies and friends , has also confronted the enemy abroad , with measures that are determined , successful , and continuing . The Al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders but many of its top commanders have been removed . There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists but their number has declined . There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction but no longer without attention and without consequence . Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many , and intimidate us all and we will stay on the offensive against them , until the fight is won . Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror and I thank the Congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed . During this time of war , we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory . Other nations around the globe have stood with us . In Afghanistan , an international force is helping provide security . In Iraq , 28 countries have troops on the ground , the United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for elections , and NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers . We are cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative , to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials . We are working closely with governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions . Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and nine other countries have captured or detained Al Qaeda terrorists . In the next four years , my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time . In the long term , the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder . If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred , they will be the recruiting grounds for terror , and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades . The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror , and replace hatred with hope , is the force of human freedom . Our enemies know this , and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the evil principle of democracy . And we have declared our own intention America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond , with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world . The United States has no right , no desire , and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else . That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies . They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression , in which a tiny group of brutal , self appointed rulers control every aspect of every life . Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations , with governments that answer to their citizens , and reflect their own cultures . And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors , the advance of freedom will lead to peace . That advance has great momentum in our time shown by women voting in Afghanistan , and Palestinians choosing a new direction , and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a President . We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty . And in the coming years , we will add to that story . The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure . Tomorrow morning , Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas . She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful , independent democratic state . To promote this democracy , I will ask Congress for 350 million to support Palestinian political , economic , and security reforms . The goal of two democratic states , Israel and Palestine , living side by side in peace is within reach and America will help them achieve that goal . To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East , the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror , while we encourage a higher standard of freedom . Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain . The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future . And the great and proud nation of Egypt , which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East , can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East . To promote peace in the broader Middle East , we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder . Syria still allows its territory , and parts of Lebanon , to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . You have passed , and we are applying , the Syrian Accountability Act and we expect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom . Today , Iran remains the world s primary state sponsor of terror pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve . We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium re processing , and end its support for terror . And to the Iranian people , I say tonight As you stand for your own liberty , America stands with you . Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom , especially in the Middle East , is now being tested and honored in Iraq . That country is a vital front in the war on terror , which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there . Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq , so we do not have to face them here at home . And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror , inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran , bring more hope and progress to a troubled region , and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren . We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty as they showed the world last Sunday . Across Iraq , often at great risk , millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly . A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day , and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote . She said , hearing those explosions , it occurred to me the insurgents are weak , they are afraid of democracy , they are losing . . . . So I got my husband , and I got my parents , and we all came out and voted together . Americans recognize that spirit of liberty , because we share it . In any nation , casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility for millions of Iraqis , it was also an act of personal courage , and they have earned the respect of us all . One of Iraq s leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al Suhail . She says of her country , we were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein . That was the real occupation . . . . Thank you to the American people who paid the cost . . . but most of all to the soldiers . Eleven years ago , Safia s father was assassinated by Saddam s intelligence service . Three days ago in Baghdad , Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country and we are honored that she is with us tonight . The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy , and will continue to attack it . Yet the terrorists most powerful myth is being destroyed . The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces , they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis , expressed in free elections . And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people . We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom , and to write their own history . As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September , Ordinary Iraqis are anxious . . . to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible . This is the natural desire of an independent nation , and it also is the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq . The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country . At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground , and in consultation with the Iraqi government , we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces forces with skilled officers , and an effective command structure . As those forces become more self reliant and take on greater security responsibilities , America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role . In the end , Iraqis must be able to defend their own country and we will help that proud , new nation secure its liberty . Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter , Tell America not to abandon us . He and all Iraqis can be certain While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances , our commitment remains firm and unchanging . We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends , and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come . We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq , because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out . We are in Iraq to achieve a result A country that is democratic , representative of all its people , at peace with its neighbors , and able to defend itself . And when that result is achieved , our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned . Right now , Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world , often taking great risks on my orders . We have given them training and equipment and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud . The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle , unwavering in loyalty , unmatched in honor and decency , and every day they are making our nation more secure . Some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries , and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover . And we have said farewell to some very good men and women , who died for our freedom , and whose memory this nation will honor forever . One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville , Texas , who was killed during the assault on Fallujah . His mom , Janet , sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine , and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror . She wrote , When Byron was home the last time , I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born . He just hugged me and said You have done your job , mom . Now it is my turn to protect you . Ladies and gentlemen , with grateful hearts , we honor freedom s defenders , and our military families , represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood s mom and dad , Janet and Bill Norwood . In these four years , Americans have seen the unfolding of large events . We have known times of sorrow , and hours of uncertainty , and days of victory . In all this history , even when we have disagreed , we have seen threads of purpose that unite us . The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom s power to change the world . We are all part of a great venture To extend the promise of freedom in our country , to renew the values that sustain our liberty , and to spread the peace that freedom brings . As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans , each age is a dream that is dying , or one that is coming to birth . And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born . The abolition of slavery was only a dream until it was fulfilled . The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream until it was achieved . The fall of imperial communism was only a dream until , one day , it was accomplished . Our generation has dreams of its own , and we also go forward with confidence . The road of Providence is uneven and unpredictable yet we know where it leads It leads to freedom . Thank you , and may God bless America .<speech_sep>Good afternoon . Congress has just passed and sent to my desk two bills concerning the use of stem cells in biomedical research . These bills illustrate both the promise and perils we face in the age of biotechnology . In this new era , our challenge is to harness the power of science to ease human suffering without sanctioning the practices that violate the dignity of human life . In 2001 , I spoke to the American people and set forth a new policy on stem cell research that struck a balance between the needs of science and the demands of conscience . When I took office , there was no federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research . Under the policy I announced five years ago , my administration became the first to make federal funds available for this research , yet only on embryonic stem cell lines derived from embryos that had already been destroyed . My administration has made available more than 90 million for research on these lines . This policy has allowed important research to go forward without using taxpayer funds to encourage the further deliberate destruction of human embryos . One of the bills Congress has passed builds on the progress we have made over the last five years . So I signed it into law . Congress has also passed a second bill that attempts to overturn the balanced policy I set . This bill would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of finding medical benefits for others . It crosses a moral boundary that our decent society needs to respect , so I vetoed it . Like all Americans , I believe our nation must vigorously pursue the tremendous possibility that science offers to cure disease and improve the lives of millions . We have opportunities to discover cures and treatments that were unthinkable generations ago . Some scientists believe that one source of these cures might be embryonic stem cell research . Embryonic stem cells have the ability to grow into specialized adult tissues , and this may give them the potential to replace damaged or defective cells or body parts and treat a variety of diseases . Yet we must also remember that embryonic stem cells come from human embryos that are destroyed for their cells . Each of these human embryos is a unique human life with inherent dignity and matchless value . We see that value in the children who are with us today . Each of these children began his or her life as a frozen embryo that was created for in vitro fertilization , but remained unused after the fertility treatments were complete . Each of these children was adopted while still an embryo , and has been blessed with the chance to grow up in a loving family . These boys and girls are not spare parts . They remind us of what is lost when embryos are destroyed in the name of research . They remind us that we all begin our lives as a small collection of cells . And they remind us that in our zeal for new treatments and cures , America must never abandon our fundamental morals . Some people argue that finding new cures for disease requires the destruction of human embryos like the ones that these families adopted . I disagree . I believe that with the right techniques and the right policies , we can achieve scientific progress while living up to our ethical responsibilities . That is what I sought in 2001 , when I set forth my administration s policy allowing federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell lines where the life and death decision had already been made . This balanced approach has worked . Under this policy , 21 human embryonic stem cell lines are currently in use in research that is eligible for federal funding . Each of these lines can be replicated many times . And as a result , the National Institutes of Health have helped make more than 700 shipments to researchers since 2001 . There is no ban on embryonic stem cell research . To the contrary , even critics of my policy concede that these federally funded lines are being used in research every day by scientists around the world . My policy has allowed us to explore the potential of embryonic stem cells , and it has allowed America to continue to lead the world in this area . Since I announced my policy in 2001 , advances in scientific research have also shown the great potential of stem cells that are derived without harming human embryos . My administration has expanded the funding of research into stem cells that can be drawn from children , adults , and the blood in umbilical cords , with no harm to the donor . And these stem cells are already being used in medical treatments . With us today are patients who have benefited from treatments with adult and umbilical cord blood stem cells . And I want to thank you all for coming . They are living proof that effective medical science can also be ethical . Researchers are now also investigating new techniques that could allow doctors and scientists to produce stem cells just as versatile as those derived from human embryos . One technique scientists are exploring would involve reprogramming an adult cell . For example , a skin cell to function like an embryonic stem cell . Science offers the hope that we may one day enjoy the potential benefits of embryonic stem cells without destroying human life . We must continue to explore these hopeful alternatives and advance the cause of scientific research while staying true to the ideals of a decent and humane society . The bill I sign today upholds these humane ideals and draws an important ethical line to guide our research . The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act was sponsored by Senators Santorum and Brownback both who are here . And by Congressman Dave Weldon , along with Nathan Deal . Thank you , Congressmen . This good law prohibits one of the most egregious abuses in biomedical research , the trafficking in human fetuses that are created with the sole intent of aborting them to harvest their parts . Human beings are not a raw material to be exploited , or a commodity to be bought or sold , and this bill will help ensure that we respect the fundamental ethical line . I am disappointed that Congress failed to pass another bill that would have promoted good research . This bill was sponsored by Senator Santorum and Senator Arlen Specter and Congressman Roscoe Bartlett . Thanks for coming , Roscoe . It would have authorized additional federal funding for promising new research that could produce cells with the abilities of embryonic cells , but without the destruction of human embryos . This is an important piece of legislation . This bill was unanimously approved by the Senate it received 273 votes in the House of Representatives , but was blocked by a minority in the House using procedural maneuvers . I am disappointed that the House failed to authorize funding for this vital and ethical research . It makes no sense to say that you are in favor of finding cures for terrible diseases as quickly as possible , and then block a bill that would authorize funding for promising and ethical stem cell research . At a moment when ethical alternatives are becoming available , we cannot lose the opportunity to conduct research that would give hope to those suffering from terrible diseases , and help move our nation beyond the current controversies over embryonic stem cell research . We must pursue this research . And so I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services , Secretary Leavitt , and the Director of the National Institutes of Health to use all the tools at their disposal to aid the search for stem cell techniques that advance promising medical science in an ethical and morally responsible way . Unfortunately , Congress has sent me a bill that fails to meet this ethical test . This legislation would overturn the balanced policy on embryonic stem cell research that my administration has followed for the past five years . This bill would also undermine the principle that Congress , itself , has followed for more than a decade , when it has prohibited federal funding for research that destroys human embryos . If this bill would have become law , American taxpayers would , for the first time in our history , be compelled to fund the deliberate destruction of human embryos . And I am not going to allow it . I made it clear to the Congress that I will not allow our nation to cross this moral line . I felt like crossing this line would be a mistake , and once crossed , we would find it almost impossible to turn back . Crossing the line would needlessly encourage a conflict between science and ethics that can only do damage to both , and to our nation as a whole . If we are to find the right ways to advance ethical medical research , we must also be willing , when necessary , to reject the wrong ways . So today , I am keeping the promise I made to the American people by returning this bill to Congress with my veto . As science brings us ever closer to unlocking the secrets of human biology , it also offers temptations to manipulate human life and violate human dignity . Our conscience and history as a nation demand that we resist this temptation . America was founded on the principle that we are all created equal , and endowed by our Creator with the right to life . We can advance the cause of science while upholding this founding promise . We can harness the promise of technology without becoming slaves to technology . And we can ensure that science serves the cause of humanity instead of the other way around . America pursues medical advances in the name of life , and we will achieve the great breakthroughs we all seek with reverence for the gift of life . I believe America s scientists have the ingenuity and skill to meet this challenge . And I look forward to working with Congress and the scientific community to achieve these great and noble goals in the years ahead . Thank you all for coming and may God bless .<speech_sep>It is my honor to welcome our friend , the President of Nigeria , to the Rose Garden . President , welcome to Washington , the Rose Garden . And of course , Kofi Annan , the Secretary General of the United Nations , Secretary General , thank you for coming . As well , we are joined by two members of my Cabinet , Secretary of State Powell , Secretary of Health and Human Services , Tommy Thompson . I want to thank them both for being here . Scott Evertz , who is the Director of the National AIDS Policy Office is with us . Scott , thank you for being here . And , of course , Condoleezza Rice , the National Security Advisor . I am looking forward to meeting with the President on a range of issues that are important to our nations . This morning , we have spoken about another matter that involves countless lives . Together , we have been discussing a strategy to halt the spread of AIDS and other infectious diseases across the African continent and across the world . The devastation across the globe left by AIDmalaria , tuberculosis , the sheer number of those infected and dying is almost beyond comprehension . Suffering on the African continent has been especially great . AIDS alone has left at least 11 million orphans in sub Sahara Africa . In several African countries , as many as half of today s 15 year olds could die of AIDIn a part of the world where so many have suffered from war and want and famine , these latest tribulations are the cruelest of fates . We have the power to help . The United States is committed to working with other nations to reduce suffering and to spare lives . And working together is the key . Only through sustained and focused international cooperation can we address problems so grave and suffering so great . My guests today have been doing their part and more , and I thank them for their leadership . President Obasanjo last month led the nations of Africa in drafting the Abuja declaration which lays out crucial guidelines for the international effort we all envision . Secretary General Annan too has made this issue an urgent priority . He has been an eloquent voice in rallying the resources and conviction needed in this cause . When he visited the White House in March , we talked about the AIDS pandemic . We agreed on a goal of creating a global fund to fight HIV AIDmalaria and tuberculosis . The G 8 has been discussing the potential fund . Our high level task force chaired by Secretaries Powell and Thompson has developed a proposal that we have shared with officials , developing nations and our G 8 partners . We will need ideas from all sources . We must all show leadership and all share responsibility . For our part , I am today committing the United States of America to support a new worldwide fund with a founding contribution of 200 million . This is in addition to the billions we spend on research and to the 760 million we are spending this year to help the international effort to fight AIDThis 200 million will go exclusively to a global fund , with more to follow as we learn where our support can be most effective . Based on this morning s meetings , I believe a consensus is forming on the basic elements that must shape the Global Fund and its use . First , we agree on the need for partnerships across borders and among both the public and private sectors . We must call upon the compassion , energy and generosity of people everywhere . This means that not only governments can help but also private corporations , foundations , faith based groups and nongovernmental organizations as well . Second , we agree on an integrated approach that emphasizes prevention and training of medical personnel as well as treatment and care . Prevention is indispensable to any strategy of controlling a pandemic such as we now face . Third , we must concentrate our efforts on programs that work , proven best practices . Whenever the Global Fund supports any health program , we must know that it meets certain essential criteria . We must know that the money is well spent , victims are well cared for and local populations are well served . That leads to the fourth criterion , namely that all proposals must be reviewed for effectiveness by medical and public health experts . Addressing a plague of this magnitude requires scientific accountability to ensure results . And , finally , we understand the importance of innovation in creating lifesaving medicines that combat diseases . That is why we believe the fund must respect intellectual property rights , as an incentive for vital research and development . This morning , we have made a good beginning . I expect the upcoming Special Session and this summer s G 8 summit in Italy to turn these ideas into reality . This is one of those moments that reminds us all in public service why we are here . It challenges us to act wisely and act together and to act quickly . Across the world at this moment , there are people in true desperation , and we must help . It is now my honor to bring to the podium , the President of Nigeria . President . It has been my honor to host this very important announcement . It is also my honor to recognize two members of the United States Congress who are going to work with this administration to make sure that our commitment becomes reality , Senator Frist and Senator Leahy . We are so thrilled you are here . We appreciate your vision and we appreciate your leadership . Thank you all for coming .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . Please be seated . Thank you . Larry , thank you for the introduction . Thank you for giving Laura and me a chance to come to this historic hall to talk about a big issue facing the world . And today I appreciate you giving me a chance to come and for me to outline the steps that America and our partners are taking and are going to take to overcome this financial crisis . And I thank the Manhattan Institute for all you have done . I appreciate the fact that I am here in a fabulous city to give this speech . People say , are you confident about our future And the answer is , absolutely . And it is easy to be confident when you are a city like New York City . After all , there is an unbelievable spirit in this city . This is a city whose skyline has offered immigrants their first glimpse of freedom . This is a city where people rallied when that freedom came under attack . This is a city whose capital markets have attracted investments from around the world and financed the dreams of entrepreneurs all across America . This is a city that has been and will always be the financial capital of the world . And I am grateful to be in the presence of two men who serve ably and nobly New York City Mayor Koch and Mayor Giuliani . Thank you all for coming . Glad you are here . I thank the Manhattan Institute Board of Trustees and its Chairman Paul Singer for doing good work , being a good policy center . And before I begin , I must say , I would hope that Ray Kelly would tell New York s finest how much I appreciate the incredible hospitality that we are always shown here in New York City . You are the head of a fabulous police force , and we thank you very much , sir . We live in a world in which our economies are interconnected . Prosperity and progress have reached farther than any time in our history . Unfortunately , as we have seen in recent months , financial turmoil anywhere in the world affects economies everywhere in the world . And so this weekend I am going to host a Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy with leaders from developed and developing nations that account for nearly 90 percent of the world economy . Leaders of the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the United Nations , and the Financial Stability Forum are going to be there , as well . We will have dinner at the White House tomorrow night , and we will meet most of the day on Saturday . The leaders attending this weekend s meeting agree on a clear purpose to address the current crisis , and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future . We also agree that this undertaking is too large to be accomplished in a single session . The issues are too complex , the problem is too significant to try to solve , or to come up with reasonable recommendations in just one meeting . So this summit will be the first of a series of meetings . It will focus on five key objectives understanding the causes of the global crisis , reviewing the effectiveness of our responses thus far , developing principles for reforming our financial and regulatory systems , launching a specific action plan to implement those principles , and reaffirming our conviction that free market principles offer the surest path to lasting prosperity . First , we are working toward a common understanding of the causes behind the global crisis . Different countries will naturally bring different perspectives , but there are some points on which we can all agree Over the past decade , the world experienced a period of strong economic growth . Nations accumulated huge amounts of savings , and looked for safe places to invest them . Because of our attractive political , legal , and entrepreneurial climates , the United States and other developed nations received a large share of that money . The massive inflow of foreign capital , combined with low interest rates , produced a period of easy credit . And that easy credit especially affected the housing market . Flush with cash , many lenders issued mortgages and many borrowers could not afford them . Financial institutions then purchased these loans , packaged them together , and converted them into complex securities designed to yield large returns . These securities were then purchased by investors and financial institutions in the United States and Europe and elsewhere often with little analysis of their true underlying value . The financial crisis was ignited when booming housing markets began to decline . As home values dropped , many borrowers defaulted on their mortgages , and institutions holding securities backed by those mortgages suffered serious losses . Because of outdated regulatory structures and poor risk management practices , many financial institutions in America and Europe were too highly leveraged . When capital ran short , many faced severe financial jeopardy . This led to high profile failures of financial institutions in America and Europe , led to contractions and widespread anxiety all of which contributed to sharp declines in the equity markets . These developments have placed a heavy burden on hardworking people around the world . Stock market drops have eroded the value of retirement accounts and pension funds . The tightening of credit has made it harder for families to borrow money for cars or home improvements or education of the children . Businesses have found it harder to get loans to expand their operations and create jobs . Many nations have suffered job losses , and have serious concerns about the worsening economy . Developing nations have been hit hard as nervous investors have withdrawn their capital . We are faced with the prospect of a global meltdown . And so we have responded with bold measures . I am a market oriented guy , but not when I am faced with the prospect of a global meltdown . At Saturday s summit , we are going to review the effectiveness of our actions . Here in the United States , we have taken unprecedented steps to boost liquidity , recapitalize financial institutions , guarantee most new debt issued by insured banks , and prevent the disorderly collapse of large , interconnected enterprises . These were historic actions taken necessary to make necessary so that the economy would not melt down and affect millions of our fellow citizens . In Europe , governments are also purchasing equity in banks and providing government guarantees for loans . In Asia , nations like China and Japan and South Korea have lowered interest rates and have launched significant economic stimulus plans . In the Middle East , nations like Kuwait and the UAE have guaranteed deposits and opened up new government lending to banks . In addition , nations around the world have taken unprecedented joint measures . Last month , a number of central banks carried out a coordinated interest rate cut . The Federal Reserve is extending needed liquidity to central banks around the world . The IMF and World Bank are working to ensure that developing nations can weather this crisis . This crisis did not develop overnight , and it is not going to be solved overnight . But our actions are having an impact . Credit markets are beginning to thaw . Businesses are gaining access to essential short term financing . A measure of stability is returning to financial systems here at home and around the world . It is going to require more time for these improvements to fully take hold , and there is going to be difficult days ahead . But the United States and our partner are taking the right steps to get through this crisis . In addition to addressing the current crisis , we will also need to make broader reforms to strengthen the global economy over the long term . This weekend , leaders will establish principles for adapting our financial systems to the realities of the 21st century marketplace . We will discuss specific actions we can take to implement these principles . We will direct our finance ministers to work with other experts and report back to us with detailed recommendations on further reasonable actions . One vital principle of reform is that our nations must make our financial markets more transparent . For example , we should consider improving accounting rules for securities , so that investors around the world can understand the true value of the assets they purchase . Secondly , we must ensure that markets , firms , and financial products are properly regulated . For example , credit default swaps financial products that insure against potential losses should be processed through centralized clearinghouses instead of through unregulated , over the counter markets . By bringing greater stability to this large and important financial sector , we reduce the risk to our overall financial systems . Third , we must enhance the integrity of our financial markets . For example , authorities in every nation should take a fresh look at the rules governing market manipulation and fraud and ensure that investors are properly protected . Fourth , we must strengthen cooperation among the world s financial authorities . For example , leading nations should better coordinate national laws and regulations . We should also reform international financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank , which are based largely on the economic order of 1944 . To better reflect the realities of today s global economy , both the IMF and World Bank should modernize their governance structures . They should consider extending greater voter voting power to dynamic developing nations , especially as they increase their contributions to these institutions . They should consider ways to streamline their executive boards , and make them more representative . In addition to these important to these management changes , we should move forward with other reforms to make the IMF and World Bank more transparent , accountable , and effective . For example , the IMF should agree to work more closely with member countries to ensure that their exchange rate policies are market oriented and fair . And the World Bank should ensure its development programs reflect the priorities of the people they are designed to serve and focus on measurable results . All these steps require decisive actions from governments around the world . At the same time , we must recognize that government intervention is not a cure all . For example , some blame the crisis on insufficient regulation of the American mortgage market . But many European countries had much more extensive regulations , and still experienced problems almost identical to our own . History has shown that the greater threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement in the market , it is too much government involvement in the market . We saw this in the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . Because these firms were chartered by the United States Congress , many believed they were backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government . Investors put huge amounts of money into Fannie and Freddie , which they used to build up irresponsibly large portfolios of mortgage backed securities . And when the housing market declined , these securities , of course , plummeted in value . It took a taxpayer funded rescue to keep Fannie and Freddie from collapsing in a way that would have devastated the global financial system . And there is a clear lesson Our aim should not be more government it should be smarter government . All this leads to the most important principle that should guide our work While reforms in the financial sector are essential , the long term solution to today s problems is sustained economic growth . And the surest path to that growth is free markets and free people . This is a decisive moment for the global economy . In the wake of the financial crisis , voices from the left and right are equating the free enterprise system with greed and exploitation and failure . It is true this crisis included failures by lenders and borrowers and by financial firms and by governments and independent regulators . But the crisis was not a failure of the free market system . And the answer is not to try to reinvent that system . It is to fix the problems we face , make the reforms we need , and move forward with the free market principles that have delivered prosperity and hope to people all across the globe . Like any other system designed by man , capitalism is not perfect . It can be subject to excesses and abuse . But it is by far the most efficient and just way of structuring an economy . At its most basic level , capitalism offers people the freedom to choose where they work and what they do , the opportunity to buy or sell products they want , and the dignity that comes with profiting from their talent and hard work . The free market system provides the incentives that lead to prosperity the incentive to work , to innovate , to save , to invest wisely , and to create jobs for others . And as millions of people pursue these incentives together , whole societies benefit . Free market capitalism is far more than economic theory . It is the engine of social mobility the highway to the American Dream . It is what makes it possible for a husband and wife to start their own business , or a new immigrant to open a restaurant , or a single mom to go back to college and to build a better career . It is what allowed entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to change the way the world sells products and searches for information . It is what transformed America from a rugged frontier to the greatest economic power in history a nation that gave the world the steamboat and the airplane , the computer and the CAT scan , the Internet and the iPod . Ultimately , the best evidence for free market capitalism is its performance compared to other economic systems . Free markets allowed Japan , an island with few natural resources , to recover from war and grow into the world s second largest economy . Free markets allowed South Korea to make itself into one of the most technologically advanced societies in the world . Free markets turned small areas like Singapore and Hong Kong and Taiwan into global economic players . Today , the success of the world s largest economies comes from their embrace of free markets . Meanwhile , nations that have pursued other models have experienced devastating results . Soviet communism starved millions , bankrupted an empire , and collapsed as decisively as the Berlin Wall . Cuba , once known for its vast fields of cane , is now forced to ration sugar . And while Iran sits atop giant oil reserves , its people cannot put enough gasoline in its in their cars . The record is unmistakable If you seek economic growth , if you seek opportunity , if you seek social justice and human dignity , the free market system is the way to go . And it would be a terrible mistake to allow a few months of crisis to undermine 60 years of success . Just as important as maintaining free markets within countries is maintaining the free movement of goods and services between countries . When nations open their markets to trade and investment , their businesses and farmers and workers find new buyers for their products . Consumers benefit from more choices and better prices . Entrepreneurs can get their ideas off the ground with funding from anywhere in the world . Thanks in large part to open markets , the volume of global trade today is nearly 30 times greater than it was six decades ago and some of the most dramatic gains have come in the developing world . As President , I have seen the transformative power of trade up close . I have been to a Caterpillar factory in East Peoria , Illinois , where thousands of good paying American jobs are supported by exports . I have walked the grounds of a trade fair in Ghana , where I met women who support their families by exporting handmade dresses and jewelry . I have spoken with a farmer in Guatemala who decided to grow high value crops he could sell overseas and helped create more than 1 , 000 jobs . Stories like these show why it is so important to keep markets open to trade and investment . This openness is especially urgent during times of economic strain . Shortly after the stock market crash in 1929 , Congress passed the Smoot Hawley tariff a protectionist measure designed to wall off America s economy from global competition . The result was not economic security . It was economic ruin . And leaders around the world must keep this example in mind , and reject the temptation of protectionism . There are clear cut ways for nations to demonstrate the commitment to open markets . The United States Congress has an immediate opportunity by approving free trade agreements with Colombia , Peru , and South Korea . America and other wealthy nations must also ensure this crisis does not become an excuse to reverse our engagement with the developing world . And developing nations should continue policies that foster enterprise and investment . As well , all nations should pledge to conclude a framework this year that leads to a successful Doha agreement . We are facing this challenge together and we are going to get through it together . The United States is determined to show the way back to economic growth and prosperity . I know some may question whether America s leadership in the global economy will continue . The world can be confident that it will , because our markets are flexible and we can rebound from setbacks . We saw that resilience in the 1940s , when America pulled itself out of Depression , marshaled a powerful army , and helped save the world from tyranny . We saw that resilience in the 1980s , when Americans overcame gas lines , turned stagflation into strong economic growth , and won the Cold War . We saw that resilience after September the 11th , 2001 , when our nation recovered from a brutal attack , revitalized our shaken economy , and rallied the forces of freedom in the great ideological struggle of the 21st century . The world will see the resilience of America once again . We will work with our partners to correct the problems in the global financial system . We will rebuild our economic strength . And we will continue to lead the world toward prosperity and peace . Thanks for coming and God bless .<speech_sep>Thank you all . Chairman Chairman , delegates , fellow citizens I am honored by your support , and I accept your nomination for President of the United States . When I when I said those words four years ago , none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring . In the heart of this great city , we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning . We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger . We learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers . We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet . And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds , and charging through sandstorms , and liberating millions , with acts of valor that would make the men of Normandy proud . Since 2001 , Americans have been given hills to climb , and found the strength to climb them . Now , because we have made the hard journey , we can see the valley below . Now , because we have faced challenges with resolve , we have historic goals within our reach , and greatness in our future . We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold us back . In the work we have done , and the work we will do , I am fortunate to have a superb Vice President . I have counted on Dick Cheney s calm and steady judgment in difficult days , and I am honored to have him at my side . I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush . Americans Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago , and we love our First Lady . I am a fortunate father of two spirited , intelligent , and lovely young women . I am blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends . And I will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush . My father served eight years at the side of another great American Ronald Reagan . His spirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall , and are in our hearts , and will always define our party . Two months from today , voters will make a choice based on the records we have built , the convictions we hold , and the vision that guides us forward . A presidential election is a contest for the future . Tonight I will tell you where I stand , what I believe , and where I will lead this country in the next four years . I believe I believe every child can learn , and every school must teach so we passed the most important federal education reform in history . Because we acted , children are making sustained progress in reading and math , America s schools are getting better , and nothing will hold us back . I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America s seniors so I brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare . Now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine . Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage , and nothing will hold us back . I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America s workers , entrepreneurs , farmers , and ranchers so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation . Because we acted , our economy is growing again , and creating jobs , and nothing will hold us back . I believe the most solemn duty of the American President is to protect the American people . If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade , the world will drift toward tragedy . This will not happen on my watch . I am running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world , and a more hopeful America . I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy that government should help people improve their lives , not try to run their lives . I believe this nation wants steady , consistent , principled leadership and that is why , with your help , we will win this election . The story of America is the story of expanding liberty an ever widening circle , constantly growing to reach further and include more . Our nation s founding commitment is still our deepest commitment In our world , and here at home , we will extend the frontiers of freedom . The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically . The workers of our parents generation typically had one job , one skill , one career , often with one company that provided health care and a pension . And most of those workers were men . Today , workers change jobs , even careers , many times during their lives , and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen , two thirds of all moms also work outside the home . This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living , support your family , and have a rewarding career . And government must take your side . Many of our most fundamental systems the tax code , health coverage , pension plans , worker training were created for the world of yesterday , not tomorrow . We will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped , prepared and thus truly free to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams . My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy . We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods , but new competition for our workers . To create more jobs in America , America must be the best place in the world to do business . To create jobs , my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining federal spending , reducing regulation , and making the tax relief permanent . To create jobs , we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy . To create jobs , we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe . And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across America . Another drag on our economy is the current tax code , which is a complicated mess filled with special interest loopholes , saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperwork and headache every year . The American people deserve and our economic future demands a simpler , fairer , pro growth system . In a new term , I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code . Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better and higher paying jobs . In this time of change , many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher level skills . So we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our community colleges . I know that with the right skills , American workers can compete with anyone , anywhere in the world . In this time of change , opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others . To stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing , textile , and other jobs we will create American opportunity zones . In these areas , we will provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business , and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of America . As I have traveled the country , I have met many workers and small business owners who have told me they are worried they cannot afford health care . More than half of the uninsured are small business employees and their families . In a new term , we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies . We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts , and provide direct help for low income Americans to purchase them . These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness , the opportunity to save tax free for routine health expenses , and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs . We will provide low income Americans with better access to health care In a new term , I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center . As I have traveled our country , I have met too many good doctors , especially OB GYNwho are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits . To make health care more affordable and accessible , we must pass medical liability reform now . And in all we do to improve health care in America , we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients , not by bureaucrats in Washington , In this time of change , government must take the side of working families . In a new term , we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp time and flex time . Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family friendly workplace . Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society , because ownership brings security , and dignity , and independence . Thanks to our policies , homeownership in America is at an all time high . Tonight we set a new goal seven million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say Welcome to my home . In an ownership society , more people will own their health care plans , and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement . We will always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers . With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement , many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it . We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account a nest egg you can call your own , and government can never take away . In all these proposals , we seek to provide not just a government program , but a path a path to greater opportunity , more freedom , and more control over your own life . And the path begins with our youngest Americans . To build a more hopeful America , we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them . Tonight , I remind every parent and every teacher , I say to every child No matter what your circumstance , no matter where you live , your school will be the path to promise of America . We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results . We are insisting on accountability , empowering parents and teachers , and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools . By testing every child , we are identifying those who need help and we are providing a record level of funding to get them that help . In northeast Georgia , Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor and this year 90 percent of the students passed state tests in reading and math . The principal the principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way We do not focus on what we cannot do at this school we focus on what we can do . And we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line . See , this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations . And that is the spirit of our education reform , and the commitment of our country No dejaremos a ningn nio atrs . We will leave no child behind . We are making progress we are making progress , and there is more to do . In this time of change , most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college , yet only about one in four students gets there . In our high schools , we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk . We will place a new focus on math and science . As we make progress , we will require a rigorous exam before graduation . By raising performance in our high schools , and expanding Pell grants for low and middle income families , we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma . America s children must also have a healthy start in life . In a new term , we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government s health insurance programs . We will not allow a lack of attention , or information , to stand between these children and the health care they need . Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online . The web address is not very imaginative , but it is easy to remember GeorgeWBush . com . These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity . And here , you face a choice . My opponent s policies are dramatically different from ours . Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts . After supporting my education reforms , he now wants to dilute them . He opposes legal and medical liability reform . He opposed reducing the marriage penalty , opposed doubling the child credit , opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them . Wait a minute , wait a minute To be fair , there are some things my opponent is for . He is proposed more than two trillion dollars in new federal spending so far , and that is a lot , even for a senator from Massachusetts . And to pay for that spending , he is running on a platform of increasing taxes and that is the kind of promise a politician usually keeps . His tax his policies of tax and spend of expanding government rather than expanding opportunity are the policies of the past . We are on the path to the future and we are not turning back . In this world of change , some things do not change the values we try to live by , the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose . Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment . Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity , I support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work . Because a caring society will value its weakest members , we must make a place for the unborn child . Because because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion , our government must never discriminate against them . Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society , I support the protection of marriage against activist judges . And I will continue to appoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law . My opponent recently announced that he is the conservative the candidate of conservative values , which must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters . There is some problems with this claim . If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood , I am afraid you are not the candidate of conservative values . If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act , which President Clinton signed , you are not the candidate of conservative values . If you gave a speech , as my opponent did , calling the Reagan presidency eight years of moral darkness , then you may be a lot of things , but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them . This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism and you know where I stand . Three days after September the 11th , I stood where Americans died , in the ruins of the Twin Towers . Workers in hard hats were shouting to me , Whatever it takes . A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said , Do not let me down . Since that day , I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country . I will never relent in defending America , whatever it takes . So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride , not for power , but because the lives of our citizens are at stake . Our strategy is clear . We have tripled funding for homeland security and trained a half a million first responders , because we are determined to protect our homeland . We are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services . We are staying on the offensive striking terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home . And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East , because freedom will bring a future of hope , and the peace we all want . And we will prevail . Our strategy is succeeding . Four years ago , Afghanistan was the home base of al Qaeda , Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups , Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising , Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons , Iraq was a gathering threat , and al Qaeda was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks . Today , the government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror , Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders , Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests , Libya is dismantling its weapons programs , the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom , and more than three quarters of al Qaeda s key members and associates have been detained or killed . We have led , many have joined , and America and the world are safer . This progress involved careful diplomacy , clear moral purpose , and some tough decisions . And the toughest came on Iraq . We knew Saddam Hussein s record of aggression and support for terror . We knew his long history of pursuing , even using , weapons of mass destruction . And we know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently We must , and we will , confront threats to America before it is too late . In Saddam Hussein , we saw a threat . Members of both political parties , including my opponent and his running mate , saw the threat , and voted to authorize the use of force . We went to the United Nations Security Council , which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm , or face serious consequences . Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply . After more than a decade of diplomacy , we gave Saddam Hussein another chance , a final chance , to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world . He again refused , and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office a decision no president would ask for , but must be prepared to make . Do I forget the lessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman , or do I take action to defend our country Faced with that choice , I will defend America every time . Because we acted to defend our country , the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history , more than 50 million people have been liberated , and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East . In Afghanistan , terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October presidential election a resounding endorsement for democracy . Despite ongoing acts of violence , Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister , a national council , and national elections are scheduled for January . Our nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq , because when America gives its word , America must keep its word . As importantly , we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer . Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies , which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export . Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them , and that helps us keep the peace . So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear We will help new leaders to train their armies , and move toward elections , and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible . And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned . Our troops know the historic importance of our work . One Army Specialist wrote home We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place . The various terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq , he continued , are really aiming at you back in the United States . This is a test of will for our country . We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories and confronting the evil terrorists . That young man is right our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for America . Tonight I want to speak to all of them , and to their families You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion . Because of your service and sacrifice , we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan , and you are making America safer . Because of you , women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium . Because of you , the people of Iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves . Because of you , the world is more just and will be more peaceful . We owe you our thanks , and we owe you something more . We will give you all the resources , all the tools , and all the support you need for victory . Again , my opponent and I have different approaches . I proposed , and the Congress overwhelmingly passed , 87 billion in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq . My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets , and fuel , and vehicles , and body armor . When asked to explain his vote , the Senator said , I actually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it . Then he said he was proud of that vote . Then , when pressed , he said it was a complicated matter . There is nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat . Our allies also know the historic importance of our work . About 40 nations stand beside us in Afghanistan , and some 30 in Iraq . And I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard , and President Kwasniewski , and Prime Minister Berlusconi and , of course , Prime Minister Tony Blair . Again , my opponent takes a different approach . In the midst of war , he has called American allies , quote , a coalition of the coerced and the bribed . That would be nations like Great Britain , Poland , Italy , Japan , the Netherlands , Denmark , El Salvador , Australia , and others allies that deserve the respect of all Americans , not the scorn of a politician . I respect every soldier , from every country , who serves beside us in the hard work of history . America is grateful , and America will not forget . The people we have freed will not forget either . Not long ago , seven Iraqi men came to see me in the Oval Office . They had X s branded into their foreheads , and their right hands had been cut off , by Saddam Hussein s secret police , the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes . During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out , in Arabic , a prayer for God to bless America . I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed , and the greatest force for good on this earth . Others understand the historic importance of our work . The terrorists know . They know that a vibrant , successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical ideology of hate . They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent . The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear and they should be afraid , because freedom is on the march . I believe in the transformational power of liberty The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom . As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment , their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region . Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach , and so is peace with our good friend , Israel . Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming . Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty , not tyranny and terror . Reformers , and political prisoners , and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever . And as freedom advances heart by heart , and nation by nation America will be more secure and the world more peaceful . America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters . In 1946 , 18 months after the fall of Berlin to Allied forces , a journalist wrote in the New York Times , Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic , political and moral crisis . capitals are frightened . In every headquarters , one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed . End quote . Maybe that same person is still around , writing editorials . Fortunately , we had a resolute president named Truman , who , with the American people , persevered , knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace . And because that generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty , we live in a better and safer world today . The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come easily , or all at once . Yet Americans , of all people , should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations . That power brought settlers on perilous journeys , inspired colonies to rebellion , ended the sin of slavery , and set our nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century . We were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan and Nicaragua and Central Europe and the Baltics and that noble story goes on . I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century . I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty . I believe that given the chance , they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever devised by man . I believe all these things because freedom is not America s gift to the world , it is the almighty God s gift to every man and woman in this world . This moment in the life of our country will be remembered . Generations will know if we kept our faith and kept our word . Generations will know if we seized this moment , and used it to build a future of safety and peace . The freedom of many , and the future security of our nation , now depend on us . And tonight , my fellow Americans , I ask you to stand with me . In the last four years , you and I have come to know each other . Even when we do not agree , at least you know what I believe and where I stand . You may have noticed I have a few flaws , too . People sometimes have to correct my English . I knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it . Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger , which in Texas is called walking . Now and then I come across as a little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white haired lady sitting right up there . One thing one thing I have learned about the presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have , people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have , you are going to need them . These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget . I have tried to comfort Americans who lost the most on September the 11th people who showed me a picture or told me a story , so I would know how much was taken from them . I have learned first hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision , even when it is right . I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers , some with a very tough road ahead , who say they were just doing their job . I have held the children of the fallen , who are told their dad or mom is a hero , but would rather just have their mom or dad . I have met with the wives and husbands who have received a folded flag , and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved . I am awed that so many have used those meetings to say that I am in their prayers and to offer encouragement to me . Where does strength like that come from How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride It is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good . Because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost . And in those military families , I have seen the character of a great nation decent , idealistic , and strong . The world saw that spirit three miles from here , when the people of this city faced peril together , and lifted a flag over the ruins , and defied the enemy with their courage . My fellow Americans , for as long as our country stands , people will look to the resurrection of New York City and they will say Here buildings fell , here a nation rose . We see America s character in our military , which finds a way or makes one . We see it in our veterans , who are supporting military families in their days of worry . We see it in our young people , who have found heroes once again . We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs , who are renewing our economy with their effort and optimism . And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt Having come this far , our tested and confident nation can achieve anything . To everything we know there is a season a time for sadness , a time for struggle , a time for rebuilding . And now we have reached a time for hope . This young century will be liberty s century . By promoting liberty abroad , we will build a safer world . By encouraging liberty at home , we will build a more hopeful America . Like generations before us , we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom . This is the everlasting dream of America and tonight , in this place , that dream is renewed . Now we go forward grateful for our freedom , faithful to our cause , and confident in the future of the greatest nation on earth . God bless you , and may God continue to bless our great country .<speech_sep>Good evening . I appreciate you giving me a few minutes of your time tonight so I can discuss with you a complex and difficult issue , an issue that is one of the most profound of our time . The issue of research involving stem cells derived from human embryos is increasingly the subject of a national debate and dinner table discussions . The issue is confronted every day in laboratories as scientists ponder the ethical ramifications of their work . It is agonized over by parents and many couples as they try to have children , or to save children already born . The issue is debated within the church , with people of different faiths , even many of the same faith coming to different conclusions . Many people are finding that the more they know about stem cell research , the less certain they are about the right ethical and moral conclusions . My administration must decide whether to allow federal funds , your tax dollars , to be used for scientific research on stem cells derived from human embryos . A large number of these embryos already exist . They are the product of a process called in vitro fertilization , which helps so many couples conceive children . When doctors match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb , they usually produce more embryos than are planted in the mother . Once a couple successfully has children , or if they are unsuccessful , the additional embryos remain frozen in laboratories . Some will not survive during long storage others are destroyed . A number have been donated to science and used to create privately funded stem cell lines . And a few have been implanted in an adoptive mother and born , and are today healthy children . Based on preliminary work that has been privately funded , scientists believe further research using stem cells offers great promise that could help improve the lives of those who suffer from many terrible diseases from juvenile diabetes to Alzheimer s , from Parkinson s to spinal cord injuries . And while scientists admit they are not yet certain , they believe stem cells derived from embryos have unique potential . You should also know that stem cells can be derived from sources other than embryos from adult cells , from umbilical cords that are discarded after babies are born , from human placenta . And many scientists feel research on these type of stem cells is also promising . Many patients suffering from a range of diseases are already being helped with treatments developed from adult stem cells . However , most scientists , at least today , believe that research on embryonic stem cells offer the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body . Scientists further believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal funds . Federal dollars help attract the best and brightest scientists . They ensure new discoveries are widely shared at the largest number of research facilities and that the research is directed toward the greatest public good . The United States has a long and proud record of leading the world toward advances in science and medicine that improve human life . And the United States has a long and proud record of upholding the highest standards of ethics as we expand the limits of science and knowledge . Research on embryonic stem cells raises profound ethical questions , because extracting the stem cell destroys the embryo , and thus destroys its potential for life . Like a snowflake , each of these embryos is unique , with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being . As I thought through this issue , I kept returning to two fundamental questions First , are these frozen embryos human life , and therefore , something precious to be protected And second , if they are going to be destroyed anyway , should not they be used for a greater good , for research that has the potential to save and improve other lives I have asked those questions and others of scientists , scholars , bioethicists , religious leaders , doctors , researchers , members of Congress , my Cabinet , and my friends . I have read heartfelt letters from many Americans . I have given this issue a great deal of thought , prayer and considerable reflection . And I have found widespread disagreement . On the first issue , are these embryos human life well , one researcher told me he believes this five day old cluster of cells is not an embryo , not yet an individual , but a pre embryo . He argued that it has the potential for life , but it is not a life because it cannot develop on its own . An ethicist dismissed that as a callous attempt at rationalization . Make no mistake , he told me , that cluster of cells is the same way you and and all the rest of us , started our lives . One goes with a heavy heart if we use these , he said , because we are dealing with the seeds of the next generation . And to the other crucial question , if these are going to be destroyed anyway , why not use them for good purpose I also found different answers . Many argue these embryos are byproducts of a process that helps create life , and we should allow couples to donate them to science so they can be used for good purpose instead of wasting their potential . Others will argue there is no such thing as excess life , and the fact that a living being is going to die does not justify experimenting on it or exploiting it as a natural resource . At its core , this issue forces us to confront fundamental questions about the beginnings of life and the ends of science . It lies at a difficult moral intersection , juxtaposing the need to protect life in all its phases with the prospect of saving and improving life in all its stages . As the discoveries of modern science create tremendous hope , they also lay vast ethical mine fields . As the genius of science extends the horizons of what we can do , we increasingly confront complex questions about what we should do . We have arrived at that brave new world that seemed so distant in 1932 , when Aldous Huxley wrote about human beings created in test tubes in what he called a hatchery . In recent weeks , we learned that scientists have created human embryos in test tubes solely to experiment on them . This is deeply troubling , and a warning sign that should prompt all of us to think through these issues very carefully . Embryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards . The initial stem cell researcher was at first reluctant to begin his research , fearing it might be used for human cloning . Scientists have already cloned a sheep . Researchers are telling us the next step could be to clone human beings to create individual designer stem cells , essentially to grow another you , to be available in case you need another heart or lung or liver . I strongly oppose human cloning , as do most Americans . We recoil at the idea of growing human beings for spare body parts , or creating life for our convenience . And while we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease , it is equally important that we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stem cell research . Even the most noble ends do not justify any means . My position on these issues is shaped by deeply held beliefs . I am a strong supporter of science and technology , and believe they have the potential for incredible good to improve lives , to save life , to conquer disease . Research offers hope that millions of our loved ones may be cured of a disease and rid of their suffering . I have friends whose children suffer from juvenile diabetes . Nancy Reagan has written me about President Reagan s struggle with Alzheimer s . My own family has confronted the tragedy of childhood leukemia . And , like all Americans , I have great hope for cures . I also believe human life is a sacred gift from our Creator . I worry about a culture that devalues life , and believe as your President I have an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in America and throughout the world . And while we are all hopeful about the potential of this research , no one can be certain that the science will live up to the hope it has generated . Eight years ago , scientists believed fetal tissue research offered great hope for cures and treatments yet , the progress to date has not lived up to its initial expectations . Embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril . So I have decided we must proceed with great care . As a result of private research , more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist . They were created from embryos that have already been destroyed , and they have the ability to regenerate themselves indefinitely , creating ongoing opportunities for research . I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines , where the life and death decision has already been made . Leading scientists tell me research on these 60 lines has great promise that could lead to breakthrough therapies and cures . This allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line , by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life . I also believe that great scientific progress can be made through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord placenta , adult and animal stem cells which do not involve the same moral dilemma . This year , your government will spend 250 million on this important research . I will also name a President s council to monitor stem cell research , to recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations , and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation . This council will consist of leading scientists , doctors , ethicists , lawyers , theologians and others , and will be chaired by Leon Kass , a leading biomedical ethicist from the University of Chicago . This council will keep us apprised of new developments and give our nation a forum to continue to discuss and evaluate these important issues . As we go forward , I hope we will always be guided by both intellect and heart , by both our capabilities and our conscience . I have made this decision with great care , and I pray it is the right one . Thank you for listening . Good night , and God bless America .<speech_sep>My fellow citizens , at this hour , American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger . On my orders , coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein s ability to wage war . These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign . More than 35 countries are giving crucial support from the use of naval and air bases , to help with intelligence and logistics , to the deployment of combat units . Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense . To all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces now in the Middle East , the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you . That trust is well placed . The enemies you confront will come to know your skill and bravery . The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military . In this conflict , America faces an enemy who has no regard for conventions of war or rules of morality . Saddam Hussein has placed Iraqi troops and equipment in civilian areas , attempting to use innocent men , women and children as shields for his own military a final atrocity against his people . I want Americans and all the world to know that coalition forces will make every effort to spare innocent civilians from harm . A campaign on the harsh terrain of a nation as large as California could be longer and more difficult than some predict . And helping Iraqis achieve a united , stable and free country will require our sustained commitment . We come to Iraq with respect for its citizens , for their great civilization and for the religious faiths they practice . We have no ambition in Iraq , except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people . I know that the families of our military are praying that all those who serve will return safely and soon . Millions of Americans are praying with you for the safety of your loved ones and for the protection of the innocent . For your sacrifice , you have the gratitude and respect of the American people . And you can know that our forces will be coming home as soon as their work is done . Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly yet , our purpose is sure . The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder . We will meet that threat now , with our Army , Air Force , Navy , Coast Guard and Marines , so that we do not have to meet it later with armies of fire fighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities . Now that conflict has come , the only way to limit its duration is to apply decisive force . And I assure you , this will not be a campaign of half measures , and we will accept no outcome but victory . My fellow citizens , the dangers to our country and the world will be overcome . We will pass through this time of peril and carry on the work of peace . We will defend our freedom . We will bring freedom to others and we will prevail . May God bless our country and all who defend her .<speech_sep>Good morning . Thank you all for coming . I take great joy in making this announcement . It is going to be one of the most important initiatives that my administration not only discusses , but implements . First , it is good to have so many groups represented here religious and non religious Catholic , Jewish , Protestant , and Muslim foundations and other non profits . I want to thank you all for coming . This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer people who lead with their hearts , and in turn , have changed the communities in which they live for the better . This meeting is a picture of the strength and diversity and compassion of our country . This is a diverse group , but we share things in common . They provide more than practical help to people in need . They touch and change hearts . And for this , America is deeply appreciative . Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs and real suffering in the shadow of America s affluence . Problems like addiction and abandonment and gang violence , domestic violence , mental illness and homelessness . We are called by conscience to respond . As I said in my inaugural address , compassion is the work of a nation , not just a government . It is more than the calling of politicians it is the calling of citizens . It is citizens who turn mean streets into good neighborhoods . It is citizens who turn cold cities into real communities . It is one of the great goals of my administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement and citizenship . We will encourage faith based and community programs without changing their mission . We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment to pluralism . I approach this goal with some basic principles Government has important responsibilities for public health or public order and civil rights . Yet government and government will never be replaced by charities and community groups . Yet when we see social needs in America , my administration will look first to faith based programs and community groups , which have proven their power to save and change lives . We will not fund the religious activities of any group , but when people of faith provide social services , we will not discriminate against them . As long as there are secular alternatives , faith based charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis , and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice their mission . And we will make sure that help goes to large organizations and to small ones as well . We value large organizations with generations of experience . We also value neighborhood healers , who have only the scars and testimony of their own experience . Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative agenda . I will send to Congress a series of ideas and proposals . Today , I want to raise the priority and profile of these issues within my own administration . I want to ensure that faith based and community groups will always have a place at the table in our deliberations . In a few moments , I will sign two executive orders . The first executive order will create a new office , called the White House Office of Faith based and Community Initiatives . The head of this office will report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities . He will oversee our initiatives on this issue . He will make sure our government , where it works with private groups , is fair and supportive . And he will highlight groups as national models so others can learn from them . The second executive order will clear away the bureaucratic barriers in several important agencies that make private groups hesitate to work with government . It will establish centers in five agencies Justice , HUHHLabor and Education to ensure greater cooperation between the government and the independent sector . These centers will report back on regulatory barriers to working with non profit groups , and make recommendations on how those barriers can be removed . I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people first , Steve Goldsmith , known as one of the most innovative mayors in America , who pioneered ways to promote community efforts . He will continue to advise me on these issues . And I have asked Steve to serve on the board of the Corporation for National Service . This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of all ages . I have asked Steve to report to me on how we can make the corporation do better , and to get help where it is most needed . And secondly , Professor John Dilulio will head the new office I am announcing today . He is one of the most influential social entrepreneurs in America . I cannot tell you how honored I am for him to leave his post in academia to join us . He is the author of a respected textbook on American government . He has a servant s heart on the issues that we will confront . He is worked with disadvantaged children . He has been a major force in mobilizing the city of Philadelphia to support faith based and community groups . It is a fantastic team . I am honored to have them on my team . I look forward to hearing from them , as well as I look forward to working with the people in this room and the social entrepreneurs all across America who have heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they had like to be loved themselves to exist and work hard , not out of the love of money , but out of the love of their fellow human beings . I am absolutely convinced the great fabric of the nation exists in neighborhoods , amongst unsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis . It is the fabric of the country that makes America unique . It is the power of promise that makes the future so promising is the power of the missions that stand behind me . This is an effort that will be an effort from , now the second week of my administration to the last week of my administration , because I am confident that this initiative , when fully implemented , will help us realize the dream that America , its hopes , its promise , its greatness , will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood , all across the land . And now it is my honor to sign the two executive orders .<speech_sep>Good evening . I am speaking to you from the city of New Orleans nearly empty , still partly under water , and waiting for life and hope to return . Eastward from Lake Pontchartrain , across the Mississippi coast , to Alabama into Florida , millions of lives were changed in a day by a cruel and wasteful storm . In the aftermath , we have seen fellow citizens left stunned and uprooted , searching for loved ones , and grieving for the dead , and looking for meaning in a tragedy that seems so blind and random . We have also witnessed the kind of desperation no citizen of this great and generous nation should ever have to know fellow Americans calling out for food and water , vulnerable people left at the mercy of criminals who had no mercy , and the bodies of the dead lying uncovered and untended in the street . These days of sorrow and outrage have also been marked by acts of courage and kindness that make all Americans proud . Coast Guard and other personnel rescued tens of thousands of people from flooded neighborhoods . Religious congregations and families have welcomed strangers as brothers and sisters and neighbors . In the community of Chalmette , when two men tried to break into a home , the owner invited them to stay and took in 15 other people who had no place to go . At Tulane Hospital for Children , doctors and nurses did not eat for days so patients could have food , and eventually carried the patients on their backs up eight flights of stairs to helicopters . Many first responders were victims themselves , wounded healers , with a sense of duty greater than their own suffering . When I met Steve Scott of the Biloxi Fire Department , he and his colleagues were conducting a house to house search for survivors . Steve told me this I lost my house and I lost my cars , but I still got my family . . . and I still got my spirit . Across the Gulf Coast , among people who have lost much , and suffered much , and given to the limit of their power , we are seeing that same spirit a core of strength that survives all hurt , a faith in God no storm can take away , and a powerful American determination to clear the ruins and build better than before . Tonight so many victims of the hurricane and the flood are far from home and friends and familiar things . You need to know that our whole nation cares about you , and in the journey ahead you are not alone . To all who carry a burden of loss , I extend the deepest sympathy of our country . To every person who has served and sacrificed in this emergency , I offer the gratitude of our country . And tonight I also offer this pledge of the American people Throughout the area hit by the hurricane , we will do what it takes , we will stay as long as it takes , to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives . And all who question the future of the Crescent City need to know there is no way to imagine America without New Orleans , and this great city will rise again . The work of rescue is largely finished the work of recovery is moving forward . In nearly all of Mississippi , electric power has been restored . Trade is starting to return to the Port of New Orleans , and agricultural shipments are moving down the Mississippi River . All major gasoline pipelines are now in operation , preventing the supply disruptions that many feared . The breaks in the levees have been closed , the pumps are running , and the water here in New Orleans is receding by the hour . Environmental officials are on the ground , taking water samples , identifying and dealing with hazardous debris , and working to get drinking water and waste water treatment systems operating again . And some very sad duties are being carried out by professionals who gather the dead , treat them with respect , and prepare them for their rest . In the task of recovery and rebuilding , some of the hardest work is still ahead , and it will require the creative skill and generosity of a united country . Our first commitment is to meet the immediate needs of those who had to flee their homes and leave all their possessions behind . For these Americans , every night brings uncertainty , every day requires new courage , and in the months to come will bring more than their fair share of struggles . The Department of Homeland Security is registering evacuees who are now in shelters and churches , or private homes , whether in the Gulf region or far away . I have signed an order providing immediate assistance to people from the disaster area . As of today , more than 500 , 000 evacuee families have gotten emergency help to pay for food , clothing , and other essentials . Evacuees who have not yet registered should contact FEMA or the Red Cross . We need to know who you are , because many of you will be eligible for broader assistance in the future . Many families were separated during the evacuation , and we are working to help you reunite . Please call this number 1 877 568 3317 that is 1 877 568 3317 and we will work to bring your family back together , and pay for your travel to reach them . In addition , we are taking steps to ensure that evacuees do not have to travel great distances or navigate bureaucracies to get the benefits that are there for them . The Department of Health and Human Services has sent more than 1 , 500 health professionals , along with over 50 tons of medical supplies including vaccines and antibiotics and medicines for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes . The Social Security Administration is delivering checks . The Department of Labor is helping displaced persons apply for temporary jobs and unemployment benefits . And the Postal Service is registering new addresses so that people can get their mail . To carry out the first stages of the relief effort and begin rebuilding at once , I have asked for , and the Congress has provided , more than 60 billion . This is an unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis , which demonstrates the compassion and resolve of our nation . Our second commitment is to help the citizens of the Gulf Coast to overcome this disaster , put their lives back together , and rebuild their communities . Along this coast , for mile after mile , the wind and water swept the land clean . In Mississippi , many thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed . In New Orleans and surrounding parishes , more than a quarter million houses are no longer safe to live in . Hundreds of thousands of people from across this region will need to find longer term housing . Our goal is to get people out of the shelters by the middle of October . So we are providing direct assistance to evacuees that allows them to rent apartments , and many already are moving into places of their own . A number of states have taken in evacuees and shown them great compassion admitting children to school , and providing health care . So I will work with the Congress to ensure that states are reimbursed for these extra expenses . In the disaster area , and in cities that have received huge numbers of displaced people , we are beginning to bring in mobile homes and trailers for temporary use . To relieve the burden on local health care facilities in the region , we are sending extra doctors and nurses to these areas . We are also providing money that can be used to cover overtime pay for police and fire departments while the cities and towns rebuild . Near New Orleans , and Biloxi , and other cities , housing is urgently needed for police and firefighters , other service providers , and the many workers who are going to rebuild these cities . Right now , many are sleeping on ships we have brought to the Port of New Orleans and more ships are on their way to the region . And we will provide mobile homes , and supply them with basic services , as close to construction areas as possible , so the rebuilding process can go forward as quickly as possible . And the federal government will undertake a close partnership with the states of Louisiana and Mississippi , the city of New Orleans , and other Gulf Coast cities , so they can rebuild in a sensible , well planned way . Federal funds will cover the great majority of the costs of repairing public infrastructure in the disaster zone , from roads and bridges to schools and water systems . Our goal is to get the work done quickly . And taxpayers expect this work to be done honestly and wisely so we will have a team of inspectors general reviewing all expenditures . In the rebuilding process , there will be many important decisions and many details to resolve , yet we are moving forward according to some clear principles . The federal government will be fully engaged in the mission , but Governor Barbour , Governor Blanco , Mayor Nagin , and other state and local leaders will have the primary role in planning for their own future . Clearly , communities will need to move decisively to change zoning laws and building codes , in order to avoid a repeat of what we have seen . And in the work of rebuilding , as many jobs as possible should go to the men and women who live in Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama . Our third commitment is this When communities are rebuilt , they must be even better and stronger than before the storm . Within the Gulf region are some of the most beautiful and historic places in America . As all of us saw on television , there is also some deep , persistent poverty in this region , as well . That poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination , which cut off generations from the opportunity of America . We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action . So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday , and let us rise above the legacy of inequality . When the streets are rebuilt , there should be many new businesses , including minority owned businesses , along those streets . When the houses are rebuilt , more families should own , not rent , those houses . When the regional economy revives , local people should be prepared for the jobs being created . Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive , but to thrive not just to cope , but to overcome . We want evacuees to come home , for the best of reasons because they have a real chance at a better life in a place they love . When one resident of this city who lost his home was asked by a reporter if he would relocate , he said , Naw , I will rebuild but I will build higher . That is our vision for the future , in this city and beyond We will not just rebuild , we will build higher and better . To meet this goal , I will listen to good ideas from Congress , and state and local officials , and the private sector . I believe we should start with three initiatives that the Congress should pass . Tonight I propose the creation of a Gulf Opportunity Zone , encompassing the region of the disaster in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama . Within this zone , we should provide immediate incentives for job creating investment , tax relief for small businesses , incentives to companies that create jobs , and loans and loan guarantees for small businesses , including minority owned enterprises , to get them up and running again . It is entrepreneurship that creates jobs and opportunity it is entrepreneurship that helps break the cycle of poverty and we will take the side of entrepreneurs as they lead the economic revival of the Gulf region . I propose the creation of Worker Recovery Accounts to help those evacuees who need extra help finding work . Under this plan , the federal government would provide accounts of up to 5 , 000 , which these evacuees could draw upon for job training and education to help them get a good job , and for child care expenses during their job search . And to help lower income citizens in the hurricane region build new and better lives , I also propose that Congress pass an Urban Homesteading Act . Under this approach , we will identify property in the region owned by the federal government , and provide building sites to low income citizens free of charge , through a lottery . In return , they would pledge to build on the lot , with either a mortgage or help from a charitable organization like Habitat for Humanity . Home ownership is one of the great strengths of any community , and it must be a central part of our vision for the revival of this region . In the long run , the New Orleans area has a particular challenge , because much of the city lies below sea level . The people who call it home need to have reassurance that their lives will be safer in the years to come . Protecting a city that sits lower than the water around it is not easy , but it can , and has been done . City and parish officials in New Orleans , and state officials in Louisiana will have a large part in the engineering decisions to come . And the Army Corps of Engineers will work at their side to make the flood protection system stronger than it has ever been . The work that has begun in the Gulf Coast region will be one of the largest reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen . When that job is done , all Americans will have something to be very proud of and all Americans are needed in this common effort . It is the armies of compassion charities and houses of worship , and idealistic men and women that give our reconstruction effort its humanity . They offer to those who hurt a friendly face , an arm around the shoulder , and the reassurance that in hard times , they can count on someone who cares . By land , by sea , and by air , good people wanting to make a difference deployed to the Gulf Coast , and they have been working around the clock ever since . The cash needed to support the armies of compassion is great , and Americans have given generously . For example , the private fundraising effort led by former Presidents Bush and Clinton has already received pledges of more than 100 million . Some of that money is going to the Governors to be used for immediate needs within their states . A portion will also be sent to local houses of worship to help reimburse them for the expense of helping others . This evening the need is still urgent , and I ask the American people to continue donating to the Salvation Army , the Red Cross , other good charities , and religious congregations in the region . It is also essential for the many organizations of our country to reach out to your fellow citizens in the Gulf area . So I have asked USA Freedom Corps to create an information clearinghouse , available at usafreedomcorps . gov , so that families anywhere in the country can find opportunities to help families in the region , or a school can support a school . And I challenge existing organizations churches , and Scout troops , or labor union locals to get in touch with their counterparts in Mississippi , Louisiana , or Alabama , and learn what they can do to help . In this great national enterprise , important work can be done by everyone , and everyone should find their role and do their part . The government of this nation will do its part , as well . Our cities must have clear and up to date plans for responding to natural disasters , and disease outbreaks , or a terrorist attack , for evacuating large numbers of people in an emergency , and for providing the food and water and security they would need . In a time of terror threats and weapons of mass destruction , the danger to our citizens reaches much wider than a fault line or a flood plain . I consider detailed emergency planning to be a national security priority , and therefore , I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to undertake an immediate review , in cooperation with local counterparts , of emergency plans in every major city in America . I also want to know all the facts about the government response to Hurricane Katrina . The storm involved a massive flood , a major supply and security operation , and an evacuation order affecting more than a million people . It was not a normal hurricane and the normal disaster relief system was not equal to it . Many of the men and women of the Coast Guard , the Federal Emergency Management Agency , the United States military , the National Guard , Homeland Security , and state and local governments performed skillfully under the worst conditions . Yet the system , at every level of government , was not well coordinated , and was overwhelmed in the first few days . It is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces the institution of our government most capable of massive logistical operations on a moment s notice . Four years after the frightening experience of September the 11th , Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency . When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation , as President , am responsible for the problem , and for the solution . So I have ordered every Cabinet Secretary to participate in a comprehensive review of the government response to the hurricane . This government will learn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina . We are going to review every action and make necessary changes , so that we are better prepared for any challenge of nature , or act of evil men , that could threaten our people . The United States Congress also has an important oversight function to perform . Congress is preparing an investigation , and I will work with members of both parties to make sure this effort is thorough . In the life of this nation , we have often been reminded that nature is an awesome force , and that all life is fragile . We are the heirs of men and women who lived through those first terrible winters at Jamestown and Plymouth , who rebuilt Chicago after a great fire , and San Francisco after a great earthquake , who reclaimed the prairie from the Dust Bowl of the 1930s . Every time , the people of this land have come back from fire , flood , and storm to build anew and to build better than what we had before . Americans have never left our destiny to the whims of nature and we will not start now . These trials have also reminded us that we are often stronger than we know with the help of grace and one another . They remind us of a hope beyond all pain and death , a God who welcomes the lost to a house not made with hands . And they remind us that we are tied together in this life , in this nation and that the despair of any touches us all . I know that when you sit on the steps of a porch where a home once stood , or sleep on a cot in a crowded shelter , it is hard to imagine a bright future . But that future will come . The streets of Biloxi and Gulfport will again be filled with lovely homes and the sound of children playing . The churches of Alabama will have their broken steeples mended and their congregations whole . And here in New Orleans , the street cars will once again rumble down Charles , and the passionate soul of a great city will return . In this place , there is a custom for the funerals of jazz musicians . The funeral procession parades slowly through the streets , followed by a band playing a mournful dirge as it moves to the cemetery . Once the casket has been laid in place , the band breaks into a joyful second line symbolizing the triumph of the spirit over death . Tonight the Gulf Coast is still coming through the dirge yet we will live to see the second line . Thank you , and may God bless America .<speech_sep>
