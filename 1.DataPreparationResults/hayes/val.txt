To the House of Representatives After a careful consideration of the bill entitled An act to prohibit military interference at elections , I return it to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , with the following objections to its approval In the communication sent to the House of Representatives on the 29th of last month , returning to the House without my approval the bill entitled An act making appropriations for the support of the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1880 , and for other purposes , I endeavored to show , by quotations from the statutes of the United States now in force and by a brief statement of facts in regard to recent elections in the several States , that no additional legislation was necessary to prevent interference with the elections by the military or naval forces of the United States . The fact was presented in that communication that at the time of the passage of the act of June 18 , 1878 , in relation to the employment of the Army as a posse comitatus or otherwise , it was maintained by its friends that it would establish a vital and fundamental principle which would secure to the people protection against a standing army . The fact was also referred to that since the passage of this act Congressional , State , and municipal elections have been held throughout the Union , and that in no instance has complaint been made of the presence of United States soldiers at the polls . Holding , as I do , the opinion that any military interference whatever at the polls is contrary to the spirit of our institutions and would tend to destroy the freedom of elections , and sincerely desiring to concur with Congress in all of its measures , it is with very great regret that I am forced to the conclusion that the bill before me is not only unnecessary to prevent such interference , but is a dangerous departure from long settled and important constitutional principles . The true rule as to the employment of military force at the elections is not doubtful . No intimidation or coercion should be allowed to control or influence citizens in the exercise of their right to vote , whether it appears in the shape of combinations of evil disposed persons , or of armed bodies of the militia of a State , or of the military force of the United States . The elections should be free from all forcible interference , and , as far as practicable , from all apprehensions of such interference . No soldiers , either of the Union or of the State militia , should be present at the polls to take the place or to perform the duties of the ordinary civil police force . There has been and will be no violation of this rule under orders from me during this Administration but there should be no denial of the right of the National Government to employ its military force on any day and at any place in case such employment is necessary to enforce the Constitution and laws of the United States . The bill before me is as follows Be it enacted , etc . , That it shall not be lawful to bring to or employ at any place where a general or special election is being held in a State any part of the Army or Navy of the United States , unless such force be necessary to repel the armed enemies of the United States or to enforce section 4 , Article Iof the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof , on application of the legislature or executive of the State where such force is to be used and so much of all laws as is inconsistent herewith is hereby repealed . It will be observed that the bill exempts from the general prohibition against the employment of military force at the polls two specified cases . These exceptions recognize and concede the soundness of the principle that military force may properly and constitutionally be used at the place of elections when such use is necessary to enforce the Constitution and the laws but the excepted cases leave the prohibition so extensive and far reaching that its adoption will seriously impair the efficiency of the executive department of the Government . The first act expressly authorizing the use of military power to execute the laws was passed almost as early as the organization of the Government under the Constitution , and was approved by President Washington May 2 , 1792 . It is as follows SE2 . And be it further enacted , That whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals by this act , the same being notified to the President of the United States by an associate justice or the district judge , it shall be lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia of such State to suppress such combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed . And if the militia of a State where such combination may happen shall refuse or be insufficient to suppress the same , it shall be lawful for the President , if the Legislature of the United States be not in session , to call forth and employ such numbers of the militia of any other State or States most convenient thereto as may be necessary and the use of militia so to be called forth may be continued , if necessary , until the expiration of thirty days after the commencement of the ensuing session . In 1795 this provision was substantially reenacted in a law which repealed the act of 1792 . In 1807 the following act became the law by the approval of President Jefferson That in all cases of insurrection or obstruction to the laws , either of the United States or of any individual State or Territory , where it is lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of suppressing such insurrection or of causing the laws to be duly executed , it shall be lawful for him to employ for the same purposes such part of the land or naval force of the United States as shall be judged necessary , having first observed all the prerequisites of the law in that respect . By this act it will be seen that the scope of the law of 1795 was extended so as to authorize the National Government to use not only the militia , but the Army and Navy of the United States , in causing the laws to be duly executed . The important provision of the acts of 1792 , 1795 , and 1807 , modified in its terms from time to time to adapt it to the existing emergency , remained in force until , by an act approved by President Lincoln July 29 , 1861 , it was reenacted substantially in the same language in which it is now found in the Revised Statutes , viz SE5298 . Whenever , by reason of unlawful obstructions , combinations , or assemblages of persons , or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States , it shall become impracticable , in the judgment of the President , to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the laws of the United States within any State or Territory , it shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all the States and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States or to suppress such rebellion , in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed . This ancient and fundamental law has been in force from the foundation of the Government . It is now proposed to abrogate it on certain days and at certain places . In my judgment no fact has been produced which tends to show that it ought to be repealed or suspended for a single hour at any place in any of the States or Territories of the Union . All the teachings of experience in the course of our history are in favor of sustaining its efficiency unimpaired . On every occasion when the supremacy of the Constitution has been resisted and the perpetuity of our institutions imperiled the principle of this statute , enacted by the fathers , has enabled the Government of the Union to maintain its authority and to preserve the integrity of the nation . At the most critical periods of our history my predecessors in the executive office have relied on this great principle . It was on this principle that President Washington suppressed the whisky rebellion in Pennsylvania in 1794 . In 1806 , on the same principle , President Jefferson broke up the Burr conspiracy by issuing orders for the employment of such force , either of the regulars or of the militia , and by such proceedings of the civil authorities , as might enable them to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise . And it was under the same authority that President Jackson crushed nullification in South Carolina and that President Lincoln issued his call for troops to save the Union in 1861 . On numerous other occasions of less significance , under probably every Administration , and certainly under the present , this power has been usefully exerted to enforce the laws , without objection by any party in the country , and almost without attracting public attention . The great elementary constitutional principle which was the foundation of the original statute of 1792 , and which has been its essence in the various forms it has assumed since its first adoption , is that the Government of the United States possesses under the Constitution , in full measure , the power of self protection by its own agencies , altogether independent of State authority , and , if need be , against the hostility of State governments . It should remain embodied in our statutes unimpaired , as it has been from the very origin of the Government . It should be regarded as hardly less valuable or less sacred than a provision of the Constitution itself . There are many other important statutes containing provisions that are liable to be suspended or annulled at the times and places of holding elections if the bill before me should become a law . I do not undertake to furnish a list of them . Many of them perhaps the most of them have been set forth in the debates on this measure . They relate to extradition , to crimes against the election laws , to quarantine regulations , to neutrality , to Indian reservations , to the civil rights of citizens , and to other subjects . In regard to them all it may be safely said that the meaning and effect of this bill is to take from the General Government an important part of its power to enforce the laws . Another grave objection to the bill is its discrimination in favor of the State and against the national authority . The presence or employment of the Army or Navy of the United States is lawful under the terms of this bill at the place where an election is being held in a State to uphold the authority of a State government then and there in need of such military intervention , but unlawful to uphold the authority of the Government of the United States then and there in need of such military intervention . Under this bill the presence or employment of the Army or Navy of the United States would be lawful and might be necessary to maintain the conduct of a State election against the domestic violence that would overthrow it , but would be unlawful to maintain the conduct of a national election against the same local violence that would overthrow it . This discrimination has never been attempted in any previous legislation by Congress , and is no more compatible with sound principles of the Constitution or the necessary maxims and methods of our system of government on occasions of elections than at other times . In the early legislation of 1792 and of 1795 , by which the militia of the States was the only military power resorted to for the execution of the constitutional powers in support of State or national authority , both functions of the Government were put upon the same footing . By the act of 1807 the employment of the Army and Navy was authorized for the performance of both constitutional duties in the same terms . In all later statutes on the same subject matter the same measure of authority to the Government has been accorded for the performance of both these duties . No precedent has been found in any previous legislation , and no sufficient reason has been given for the discrimination in favor of the State and against the national authority which this bill contains . Under the sweeping terms of the bill the National Government is effectually shut out from the exercise of the right and from the discharge of the imperative duty to use its whole executive power whenever and wherever required for the enforcement of its laws at the places and times when and where its elections are held . The employment of its organized armed forces for any such purpose would be an offense against the law unless called for by , and therefore upon permission of , the authorities of the State in which the occasion arises . What is this but the substitution of the discretion of the State governments for the discretion of the Government of the United States as to the performance of its own duties In my judgment this is an abandonment of its obligations by the National Government a subordination of national authority and an intrusion of State supervision over national duties which amounts , in spirit and tendency , to State supremacy . Though I believe that the existing statutes are abundantly adequate to completely prevent military interference with the elections in the sense in which the phrase is used in the title of this bill and is employed by the people of this country , I shall find no difficulty in concurring in any additional legislation limited to that object which does not interfere with the indispensable exercise of the powers of the Government under the Constitution and laws .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens We have assembled to repeat the public ceremonial , begun by Washington , observed by all my predecessors , and now a time honored custom , which marks the commencement of a new term of the Presidential office . Called to the duties of this great trust , I proceed , in compliance with usage , to announce some of the leading principles , on the subjects that now chiefly engage the public attention , by which it is my desire to be guided in the discharge of those duties . I shall not undertake to lay down irrevocably principles or measures of administration , but rather to speak of the motives which should animate us , and to suggest certain important ends to be attained in accordance with our institutions and essential to the welfare of our country . At the outset of the discussions which preceded the recent Presidential election it seemed to me fitting that I should fully make known my sentiments in regard to several of the important questions which then appeared to demand the consideration of the country . Following the example , and in part adopting the language , of one of my predecessors , I wish now , when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away , to repeat what was said before the election , trusting that my countrymen will candidly weigh and understand it , and that they will feel assured that the sentiments declared in accepting the nomination for the Presidency will be the standard of my conduct in the path before me , charged , as I now am , with the grave and difficult task of carrying them out in the practical administration of the Government so far as depends , under the Constitution and laws on the Chief Executive of the nation . The permanent pacification of the country upon such principles and by such measures as will secure the complete protection of all its citizens in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights is now the one subject in our public affairs which all thoughtful and patriotic citizens regard as of supreme importance . Many of the calamitous efforts of the tremendous revolution which has passed over the Southern States still remain . The immeasurable benefits which will surely follow , sooner or later , the hearty and generous acceptance of the legitimate results of that revolution have not yet been realized . Difficult and embarrassing questions meet us at the threshold of this subject . The people of those States are still impoverished , and the inestimable blessing of wise , honest , and peaceful local self government is not fully enjoyed . Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of things , the fact is clear that in the progress of events the time has come when such government is the imperative necessity required by all the varied interests , public and private , of those States . But it must not be forgotten that only a local government which recognizes and maintains inviolate the rights of all is a true self government . With respect to the two distinct races whose peculiar relations to each other have brought upon us the deplorable complications and perplexities which exist in those States , it must be a government which guards the interests of both races carefully and equally . It must be a government which submits loyally and heartily to the Constitution and the laws the laws of the nation and the laws of the States themselves accepting and obeying faithfully the whole Constitution as it is . Resting upon this sure and substantial foundation , the superstructure of beneficent local governments can be built up , and not otherwise . In furtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution , and in behalf of all that its attainment implies , all so called party interests lose their apparent importance , and party lines may well be permitted to fade into insignificance . The question we have to consider for the immediate welfare of those States of the Union is the question of government or no government of social order and all the peaceful industries and the happiness that belongs to it , or a return to barbarism . It is a question in which every citizen of the nation is deeply interested , and with respect to which we ought not to be , in a partisan sense , either Republicans or Democrats , but fellow citizens and fellowmen , to whom the interests of a common country and a common humanity are dear . The sweeping revolution of the entire labor system of a large portion of our country and the advance of 4 , 000 , 000 people from a condition of servitude to that of citizenship , upon an equal footing with their former masters , could not occur without presenting problems of the gravest moment , to be dealt with by the emancipated race , by their former masters , and by the General Government , the author of the act of emancipation . That it was a wise , just , and providential act , fraught with good for all concerned , is not generally conceded throughout the country . That a moral obligation rests upon the National Government to employ its constitutional power and influence to establish the rights of the people it has emancipated , and to protect them in the enjoyment of those rights when they are infringed or assailed , is also generally admitted . The evils which afflict the Southern States can only be removed or remedied by the united and harmonious efforts of both races , actuated by motives of mutual sympathy and regard and while in duty bound and fully determined to protect the rights of all by every constitutional means at the disposal of my Administration , I am sincerely anxious to use every legitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient local self government as the true resource of those States for the promotion of the contentment and prosperity of their citizens . In the effort I shall make to accomplish this purpose I ask the cordial cooperation of all who cherish an interest in the welfare of the country , trusting that party ties and the prejudice of race will be freely surrendered in behalf of the great purpose to be accomplished . In the important work of restoring the South it is not the political situation alone that merits attention . The material development of that section of the country has been arrested by the social and political revolution through which it has passed , and now needs and deserves the considerate care of the National Government within the just limits prescribed by the Constitution and wise public economy . But at the basis of all prosperity , for that as well as for every other part of the country , lies the improvement of the intellectual and moral condition of the people . Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education . To this end , liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the State governments , and , if need be , supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority . Let me assure my countrymen of the Southern States that it is my earnest desire to regard and promote their truest interest the interests of the white and of the colored people both and equally and to put forth my best efforts in behalf of a civil policy which will forever wipe out in our political affairs the color line and the distinction between North and South , to the end that we may have not merely a united North or a united South , but a united country . I ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform in our civil service a reform not merely as to certain abuses and practices of so called official patronage which have come to have the sanction of usage in the several Departments of our Government , but a change in the system of appointment itself a reform that shall be thorough , radical , and complete a return to the principles and practices of the founders of the Government . They neither expected nor desired from public officers any partisan service . They meant that public officers should owe their whole service to the Government and to the people . They meant that the officer should be secure in his tenure as long as his personal character remained untarnished and the performance of his duties satisfactory . They held that appointments to office were not to be made nor expected merely as rewards for partisan services , nor merely on the nomination of members of Congress , as being entitled in any respect to the control of such appointments . The fact that both the great political parties of the country , in declaring their principles prior to the election , gave a prominent place to the subject of reform of our civil service , recognizing and strongly urging its necessity , in terms almost identical in their specific import with those I have here employed , must be accepted as a conclusive argument in behalf of these measures . It must be regarded as the expression of the united voice and will of the whole country upon this subject , and both political parties are virtually pledged to give it their unreserved support . The President of the United States of necessity owes his election to office to the suffrage and zealous labors of a political party , the members of which cherish with ardor and regard as of essential importance the principles of their party organization but he should strive to be always mindful of the fact that he serves his party best who serves the country best . In furtherance of the reform we seek , and in other important respects a change of great importance , I recommend an amendment to the Constitution prescribing a term of six years for the Presidential office and forbidding a reelection . With respect to the financial condition of the country , I shall not attempt an extended history of the embarrassment and prostration which we have suffered during the past three years . The depression in all our varied commercial and manufacturing interests throughout the country , which began in September , 1873 , still continues . It is very gratifying , however , to be able to say that there are indications all around us of a coming change to prosperous times . Upon the currency question , intimately connected , as it is , with this topic , I may be permitted to repeat here the statement made in my letter of acceptance , that in my judgment the feeling of uncertainty inseparable from an irredeemable paper currency , with its fluctuation of values , is one of the greatest obstacles to a return to prosperous times . The only safe paper currency is one which rests upon a coin basis and is at all times and promptly convertible into coin . I adhere to the views heretofore expressed by me in favor of Congressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption of specie payments , and I am satisfied not only that this is wise , but that the interests , as well as the public sentiment , of the country imperatively demand it . Passing from these remarks upon the condition of our own country to consider our relations with other lands , we are reminded by the international complications abroad , threatening the peace of Europe , that our traditional rule of noninterference in the affairs of foreign nations has proved of great value in past times and ought to be strictly observed . The policy inaugurated by my honored predecessor , President Grant , of submitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves and foreign powers points to a new , and incomparably the best , instrumentality for the preservation of peace , and will , as I believe , become a beneficent example of the course to be pursued in similar emergencies by other nations . If , unhappily , questions of difference should at any time during the period of my Administration arise between the United States and any foreign government , it will certainly be my disposition and my hope to aid in their settlement in the same peaceful and honorable way , thus securing to our country the great blessings of peace and mutual good offices with all the nations of the world . Fellow citizens , we have reached the close of a political contest marked by the excitement which usually attends the contests between great political parties whose members espouse and advocate with earnest faith their respective creeds . The circumstances were , perhaps , in no respect extraordinary save in the closeness and the consequent uncertainty of the result . For the first time in the history of the country it has been deemed best , in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case , that the objections and questions in dispute with reference to the counting of the electoral votes should be referred to the decision of a tribunal appointed for this purpose . That tribunal established by law for this sole purpose its members , all of them , men of long established reputation for integrity and intelligence , and , with the exception of those who are also members of the supreme judiciary , chosen equally from both political parties its deliberations enlightened by the research and the arguments of able counsel was entitled to the fullest confidence of the American people . Its decisions have been patiently waited for , and accepted as legally conclusive by the general judgment of the public . For the present , opinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several conclusions announced by that tribunal . This is to be anticipated in every instance where matters of dispute are made the subject of arbitration under the forms of law . Human judgment is never unerring , and is rarely regarded as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful party in the contest . The fact that two great political parties have in this way settled a dispute in regard to which good men differ as to the facts and the law no less than as to the proper course to be pursued in solving the question in controversy is an occasion for general rejoicing . Upon one point there is entire unanimity in public sentiment that conflicting claims to the Presidency must be amicably and peaceably adjusted , and that when so adjusted the general acquiescence of the nation ought surely to follow . It has been reserved for a government of the people , where the right of suffrage is universal , to give to the world the first example in history of a great nation , in the midst of the struggle of opposing parties for power , hushing its party tumults to yield the issue of the contest to adjustment according to the forms of law . Looking for the guidance of that Divine Hand by which the destinies of nations and individuals are shaped , I call upon you , Senators , Representatives , judges , fellow citizens , here and everywhere , to unite with me in an earnest effort to secure to our country the blessings , not only of material prosperity , but of justice , peace , and union a union depending not upon the constraint of force , but upon the loving devotion of a free people and that all things may be so ordered and settled upon the best and surest foundations that peace and happiness , truth and justice , religion and piety , may be established among us for all generations .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Whereas it has become known to me that certain evil disposed persons have within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States begun and set on foot preparations for an organized and forcible possession of and settlement upon the lands of what is known as the Indian Territory , west of the State of Arkansas , which Territory is designated , recognized , and described by the treaties and laws of the United States and by the executive authorities as Indian country , and as such is only subject to occupation by Indian tribes , officers of the Indian Department , military posts , and such persons as may be privileged to reside and trade therein under the intercourse laws of the United States and Whereas those laws provide for the removal of all persons residing and trading therein without express permission of the Indian Department and agents , and also of all persons whom such agents may deem to be improper persons to reside in the Indian country Now , therefore , for the purpose of properly protecting the interests of the Indian nations and tribes , as well as of the United States , in said Indian Territory , and of duly enforcing the laws governing the same , Rutherford Hayes , President of the United States , do admonish and warn all such persons so intending or preparing to remove upon said lands or into said Territory without permission of the proper agent of the Indian Department against any attempt to so remove or settle upon any of the lands of said Territory and I do further warn and notify any and all such persons who may so offend that they will be speedily and immediately removed therefrom by the agent , according to the laws made and provided and if necessary the aid and assistance of the military forces of the United States will be invoked to carry into proper execution the laws of the United States herein referred to . In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , this 26th day of April , 1879 , and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and third . RUTHERFORD HAYES By the President Wm . EVARTSecretary of State .<speech_sep>To the Senate I transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State and the accompanying papers , in response to the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 11th day of February last , requesting copies of all correspondence between this Government and any foreign government since February , 1869 , respecting a ship canal across the isthmus between North America and South America , together with copies of any projet of treaties respecting the same which the Department of State may have proposed or submitted since that date to any foreign power or its diplomatic representative . In further compliance with the resolution of the Senate , I deem it proper to state briefly my opinion as to the policy of the United States with respect to the construction of an interoceanic canal by any route across the American Isthmus . The policy of this country is a canal under American control . The United States can not consent to the surrender of this control to any European power or to any combination of European powers . If existing treaties between the United States and other nations or if the rights of sovereignty or property of other nations stand in the way of this policy a contingency which is not apprehended suitable steps should be taken by just and liberal negotiations to promote and establish the American policy on this subject consistently with the rights of the nations to be affected by it . The capital invested by corporations or citizens of other countries in such an enterprise must in a great degree look for protection to one or more of the great powers of the world . No European power can intervene for such protection without adopting measures on this continent which the United States would deem wholly inadmissible . If the protection of the United States is relied upon , the United States must exercise such control as will enable this country to protect its national interests and maintain the rights of those whose private capital is embarked in the work . An interoceanic canal across the American Isthmus will essentially change the geographical relations between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and between the United States and the rest of the world . It would be the great ocean thoroughfare between our Atlantic and our Pacific shores , and virtually a part of the coast line of the United States . Our merely commercial interest in it is greater than that of all other countries , while its relations to our power and prosperity as a nation , to our means of defense , our unity , peace , and safety , are matters of paramount concern to the people of the United States . No other great power would under similar circumstances fail to assert a rightful control over a work so closely and vitally affecting its interest and welfare . Without urging further the grounds of my opinion , I repeat , in conclusion , that it is the right and the duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects North and South America as will protect our national interests . This , I am quite sure , will be found not only compatible with but promotive of the widest and most permanent advantage to commerce and civilization .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives After mature consideration of the bill entitled An act making appropriations for the legislative , executive , and judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1880 , and for other purposes , I herewith return it to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , with the following objections to its approval The main purpose of the bill is to appropriate the money required to support during the next fiscal year the several civil departments of the Government . The amount appropriated exceeds in the aggregate 18 , 000 , 000 . This money is needed to keep in operation the essential functions of all the great departments of the Government legislative , executive , and judicial . If the bill contained no other provisions , no objection to its approval would be made . It embraces , however , a number of clauses , relating to subjects of great general interest , which are wholly unconnected with the appropriations which it provides for . The objections to the practice of tacking general legislation to appropriation bills , especially when the object is to deprive a coordinate branch of the Government of its right to the free exercise of its own discretion and judgment touching such general legislation , were set forth in the special message in relation to House bill No . 1 , which was returned to the House of Representatives on the 29th of last month . I regret that the objections which were then expressed to this method of legislation have not seemed to Congress of sufficient weight to dissuade from this renewed incorporation of general enactments in an appropriation bill , and that my constitutional duty in respect of the general legislation thus placed before me can not be discharged without seeming to delay , however briefly , the necessary appropriations by Congress for the support of the Government . Without repeating these objections , I respectfully refer to that message for a statement of my views on the principle maintained in debate by the advocates of this bill , viz , that to withhold appropriations is a constitutional means for the redress of what the majority of the House of Representatives may regard as a grievance . The bill contains the following clauses , viz And provided further , That the following sections of the Revised Statutes of the United States , namely , sections 2016 , 2018 , and 2020 , and all of the succeeding sections of said statutes down to and including section 2027 , and also section 5522 , be , and the same are hereby , repealed and that all the other sections of the Revised Statutes , and all laws and parts of laws authorizing the appointment of chief supervisors of elections , special deputy marshals of elections , or general deputy marshals having any duties to perform in respect , to any election , and prescribing their duties and powers and allowing them compensation , be , and the same are hereby , repealed . It also contains clauses amending sections 2017 , 2019 , 2028 , and 2031 of the Revised Statutes . The sections of the Revised Statutes which the bill , if approved , would repeal or amend are part of an act approved May 30 , 1870 , and amended February 28 , 1871 , entitled An act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of this Union , and for other purposes . All of the provisions of the above named acts which it is proposed in this bill to repeal or modify relate to the Congressional elections . The remaining portion of the law , which will continue in force after the enactment of this measure , is that which provides for the appointment , by a judge of the circuit court of the United States , of two supervisors of election in each election district at any Congressional election , on due application of citizens who desire , in the language of the law , to have such election guarded and scrutinized . The duties of the supervisors will be to attend at the polls at all Congressional elections , and to remain after the polls are open until every vote cast has been counted but they will have no authority to make arrests or to perform other duties than to be in the immediate presence of the officers holding the election and to witness all their proceedings , including the counting of the votes and the making of a return thereof . The part of the election law which will be repealed by the approval of this bill includes those sections which give authority to the supervisors of elections to personally scrutinize , count , and canvass each ballot , and all the sections which confer authority upon the United States marshals and deputy marshals in connection with the Congressional elections . The enactment of this bill will also repeal section 5522 of the criminal statutes of the United States , which was enacted for the protection of United States officers engaged in the discharge of their duties at the Congressional elections . This section protects supervisors and marshals in the performance of their duties by making the obstruction or the assaulting of these officers , or any interference with them , by bribery or solicitation or otherwise , crimes against the United States . The true meaning and effect of the proposed legislation are plain . The supervisors , with the authority to observe and witness the proceedings at the Congressional elections , will be left , but there will be no power to protect them , or to prevent interference with their duties , or to punish any violation of the law from which their powers are derived . If this bill is approved , only the shadow of the authority of the United States at the national elections will remain the substance will be gone . The supervision of the elections will be reduced to a mere inspection , without authority on the part of the supervisors to do any act whatever to make the election a fair one . All that will be left to the supervisors is the permission to have such oversight of the elections as political parties are in the habit of exercising without any authority of law , in order to prevent their opponents from obtaining unfair advantages . The object of the bill is to destroy any control whatever by the United States over the Congressional elections . The passage of this bill has been urged upon the ground that the election of members of Congress is a matter which concerns the States alone that these elections should be controlled exclusively by the States that there are and can be no such elections as national elections , and that the existing law of the United States regulating the Congressional elections is without warrant in the Constitution . It is evident , however , that the framers of the Constitution regarded the election of members of Congress in every State and in every district as in a very important sense justly a matter of political interest and concern to the whole country . The original provision of the Constitution on this subject is as follows sec . 4 , Art . I The times , places , and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof but the Congress may at any time , by law , make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . A further provision has been since added , which is embraced in the fifteenth amendment . It is as follows Sec . 1 . The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . Sec . 2 . The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation . Under the general provision of the Constitution sec . 4 , Art . 1 Congress in 1866 passed a comprehensive law which prescribed full and detailed regulations for the election of Senators by the legislatures of the several States . This law has been in force almost thirteen years . In pursuance of it all the members of the present Senate of the United States hold their seats . Its constitutionality is not called in question . It is confidently believed that no sound argument can be made in support of the constitutionality of national regulation of Senatorial elections which will not show that the elections of members of the House of Representatives may also be constitutionally regulated by the national authority . The bill before me itself recognizes the principle that the Congressional elections are not State elections , but national elections . It leaves in full force the existing statute under which supervisors are still to be appointed by national authority to observe and witness the Congressional elections whenever due application is made by citizens who desire said elections to be guarded and scrutinized . If the power to supervise in any respect whatever the Congressional elections exists under section 4 , Article 1 , of the Constitution , it is a power which , like every other power belonging to the Government of the United States , is paramount and supreme , and includes the right to employ the necessary means to carry it into effect . The statutes of the United States which regulate the election of members of the House of Representatives , an essential part of which it is proposed to repeal by this bill , have been in force about eight years . Four Congressional elections have been held under them , two of which were at the Presidential elections of 1872 and 1876 . Numerous prosecutions , trials , and convictions have been had in the courts of the United States in all parts of the Union for violations of these laws . In no reported case has their constitutionality been called in question by any judge of the courts of the United States . The validity of these laws is sustained by the uniform course of judicial action and opinion . If it is urged that the United States election laws are not necessary , an ample reply is furnished by the history of their origin and of their results . They were especially prompted by the investigation and exposure of the frauds committed in the city and State of New York at the elections of 1868 . Committees representing both of the leading political parties of the country have submitted reports to the House of Representatives on the extent of those frauds . A committee of the Fortieth Congress , after a full investigation , reached the conclusion that the number of fraudulent votes cast in the city of New York alone in 1868 was not less than 25 , 000 . A committee of the Forty fourth Congress in their report , submitted in 1877 , adopted the opinion that for every 100 actual voters of the city of New York in 1868 108 votes were cast , when in fact the number of lawful votes cast could not have exceeded 88 per cent of the actual voters of the city . By this statement the number of fraudulent votes at that election in the city of New York alone was between thirty and forty thousand . These frauds completely reversed the result of the election in the State of New York , both as to the choice of governor and State officers and as to the choice of electors of President and Vice President of the United States . They attracted the attention of the whole country . It was plain that if they could be continued and repeated with impunity free government was impossible . A distinguished Senator , in opposing the passage of the election laws , declared that he had for a long time believed that our form of government was a comparative failure in the larger cities . To meet these evils and to prevent these crimes the United States laws regulating Congressional elections were enacted . The framers of these laws have not been disappointed in their results . In the large cities , under their provisions , the elections have been comparatively peaceable , orderly , and honest . Even the opponents of these laws have borne testimony to their value and efficiency and to the necessity for their enactment . The committee of the Forty fourth Congress , composed of members a majority of whom were opposed to these laws , in their report on the New York election of 1876 , said The committee would commend to other portions of the country and to other cities this remarkable system , developed through the agency of both local and Federal authorities acting in harmony for an honest purpose . In no portion of the world and in no era of time where there has been an expression of the popular will through the forms of law has there been a more complete and thorough illustration of republican institutions . Whatever may have been the previous habit or conduct of elections in those cities , or howsoever they may conduct themselves in the future , this election of 1876 will stand as a monument of what good faith , honest endeavor , legal forms , and just authority may do for the protection of the electoral franchise . This bill recognizes the authority and duty of the United States to appoint supervisors to guard and scrutinize the Congressional elections , but it denies to the Government of the United States all power to make its supervision effectual . The great body of the people of all parties want free and fair elections . They do not think that a free election means freedom from the wholesome restraints of law or that the place of election should be a sanctuary for lawlessness and crime . On the day of an election peace and good order are more necessary than on any other day of the year . On that day the humblest and feeblest citizens , the aged and the infirm , should be , and should have reason to feel that they are , safe in the exercise of their most responsible duty and their most sacred right as members of society their duty and their right to vote . The constitutional authority to regulate the Congressional elections which belongs to the Government of the United States , and which it is necessary to exert to secure the right to vote to every citizen possessing the requisite qualifications , ought to be enforced by appropriate legislation . So far from public opinion in any part of the country favoring any relaxation of the authority of the Government in the protection of elections from violence and corruption , I believe it demands greater vigor both in the enactment and in the execution of the laws framed for that purpose . Any oppression , any partisan partiality , which experience may have shown in the working of existing laws may well engage the careful attention both of Congress and of the Executive , in their respective spheres of duty , for the correction of these mischiefs . As no Congressional elections occur until after the regular session of Congress will have been held , there seems to be no public exigency that would preclude a seasonable consideration at that session of any administrative details that might improve the present methods designed for the protection of all citizens in the complete and equal exercise of the right and power of the suffrage at such elections . But with my views , both of the constitutionality and of the value of the existing laws , I can not approve any measure for their repeal except in connection with the enactment of other legislation which may reasonably be expected to afford wiser and more efficient safeguards for free and honest Congressional elections . June 23 , 1879 Hayes vetoes this appropriations bill designated by Democrats , which excludes implementation of election law funds . To the House of Representatives After careful examination of the bill entitled An act making appropriations for certain judicial expenses , I return it herewith to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , with the following objections to its approval The general purpose of the bill is to provide for certain judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1880 , for which the sum of 2 , 690 , 000 is appropriated . These appropriations are required to keep in operation the general functions of the judicial department of the Government , and if this part of the bill stood alone there would be no objection to its approval . It contains , however , other provisions , to which I desire respectfully to ask your attention . At the present session of Congress a majority of both Houses , favoring a repeal of the Congressional election laws embraced in title 26 of the Revised Statutes , passed a measure for that purpose , as part of a bill entitled An act making appropriations for the legislative , executive , and judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1880 , and for other purposes . Unable to concur with Congress in that measure , on the 29th of May last I returned the bill to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , without my approval , for that further consideration for which the Constitution provides . On reconsideration the bill was approved by less than two thirds of the House , and failed to become a law . The election laws therefore remain valid enactments , and the supreme law of the land , binding not only upon all private citizens , but also alike and equally binding upon all who are charged with the duties and responsibilities of the legislative , the executive , and the judicial departments of the Government . It is not sought by the bill before me to repeal the election laws . Its object is to defeat their enforcement . The last clause of the first section is as follows And no part of the money hereby appropriated is appropriated to pay any salaries , compensation , fees , or expenses under or in virtue of title 26 of the Revised Statutes , or of any provision of said title . Title 26 of the Revised Statutes , referred to in the foregoing clause , relates to the elective franchise , and contains the laws now in force regulating the Congressional elections . The second section of the bill reaches much further . It is as follows Sec . 2 . That the sums appropriated in this act for the persons and public service embraced in its provisions are in full for such persons and public service for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1880 and no Department or officer of the Government shall during said fiscal year make any contract or incur any liability for the future payment of money under any of the provisions of title 26 of the Revised Statutes of the United States authorizing the appointment or payment of general or special deputy marshals for service in connection with elections or on election day until an appropriation sufficient to meet such contract or pay such liability shall have first been made by law . This section of the bill is intended to make an extensive and essential change in the existing laws . The following are the provisions of the statutes on the same subject which are now in force Sec . 3679 . No Department of the Government shall expend in any one fiscal year any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year , or involve the Government in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations . Sec . 3732 . No contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made unless the same is authorized by law or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment , except in the War and Navy Departments , for clothing , subsistence , forage , fuel , quarters , or transportation , which , however , shall not exceed the necessities of the current year . The object of these sections of the Revised Statutes is plain . It is , first , to prevent any money from being expended unless appropriations have been made therefor , and , second , to prevent the Government from being bound by any contract not previously authorized by law , except for certain necessary purposes in the War and Navy Departments . Under the existing laws the failure of Congress to make the appropriations required for the execution of the provisions of the election laws would not prevent their enforcement . The right and duty to appoint the general and special deputy marshals which they provide for would still remain , and the executive department of the Government would also be empowered to incur the requisite liability for their compensation . But the second section of this bill contains a prohibition not found in any previous legislation . Its design is to render the election laws inoperative and a dead letter during the next fiscal year . It is sought to accomplish this by omitting to appropriate money for their enforcement and by expressly prohibiting any Department or officer of the Government from incurring any liability under any of the provisions of title 26 of the Revised Statutes authorizing the appointment or payment of general or special deputy marshals for service on election days until an appropriation sufficient to pay such liability shall have first been made . The President is called upon to give his affirmative approval to positive enactments which in effect deprive him of the ordinary and necessary means of executing laws still left in the statute book and embraced within his constitutional duty to see that the laws are executed . If he approves the bill , and thus gives to such positive enactments the authority of law , he participates in the curtailment of his means of seeing that the law is faithfully executed , while the obligation of the law and of his constitutional duty remains unimpaired . The appointment of special deputy marshals is not made by the statute a spontaneous act of authority on the part of any executive or judicial officer of the Government , but is accorded as a popular right of the citizens to call into operation this agency for securing the purity and freedom of elections in any city or town having 20 , 000 inhabitants or upward . Section 2021 of the Revised Statutes puts it in the power of any two citizens of such city or town to require of the marshal of the district the appointment of these special deputy marshals . Thereupon the duty of the marshal becomes imperative , and its nonperformance would expose him to judicial mandate or punishment or to removal from office by the President , as the circumstances of his conduct might require . The bill now before me neither revokes this popular right of the citizens , nor relieves the marshal of the duty imposed by law , nor the President of his duty to see that this law is faithfully executed . I forbear to enter again upon any general discussion of the wisdom and necessity of the election laws or of the dangerous and unconstitutional principle of this bill that the power vested in Congress to originate appropriations involves the right to compel the Executive to approve any legislation which Congress may see fit to attach to such bills , under the penalty of refusing the means needed to carry on essential functions of the Government . My views on these subjects have been sufficiently presented in the special messages sent by me to the House of Representatives during their present session . What was said in those messages I regard as conclusive as to my duty in respect to the bill before me . The arguments urged in those communications against the repeal of the election laws and against the right of Congress to deprive the Executive of that separate and independent discretion and judgment which the Constitution confers and requires are equally cogent in opposition to this bill . This measure leaves the powers and duties of the supervisors of elections untouched . The compensation of those officers is provided for under permanent laws , and no liability for which an appropriation is now required would therefore be incurred by their appointment . But the power of the National Government to protect them in the discharge of their duty at the polls would be taken away . The States may employ both civil and military power at the elections , but by this bill even the civil authority to protect Congressional elections is denied to the United States . The object is to prevent any adequate control by the United States over the national elections by forbidding the payment of deputy marshals , the officers who are clothed with authority to enforce the election laws . The fact that these laws are deemed objectionable by a majority of both Houses of Congress is urged as a sufficient warrant for this legislation . There are two lawful ways to overturn legislative enactments . One is their repeal the other is the decision of a competent tribunal against their validity . The effect of this bill is to deprive the executive department of the Government of the means to execute laws which are not repealed , which have not been declared invalid , and which it is therefore the duty of the executive and of every other department of Government to obey and to enforce . I have in my former message on this subject expressed a willingness to concur in suitable amendments for the improvement of the election laws but I can not consent to their absolute and entire repeal , and I can not approve legislation which seeks to prevent their enforcement .<speech_sep>
