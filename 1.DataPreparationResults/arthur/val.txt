To the Senate of the United States After careful consideration of Senate bill No . 71 , entitled An act to execute certain treaty stipulations relating to Chinese , I herewith return it to the Senate , in which it originated , with my objections to its passage . A nation is justified in repudiating its treaty obligations only when they are in conflict with great paramount interests . Even then all possible reasonable means for modifying or changing those obligations by mutual agreement should be exhausted before resorting to the supreme fight of refusal to comply with them . These rules have governed the United States in their past intercourse with other powers as one of the family of nations . I am persuaded that if Congress can feel that this act violates the faith of the nation as pledged to China it will concur with me in rejecting this particular mode of regulating Chinese immigration , and will endeavor to find another which shall meet the expectations of the people of the United States without coming in conflict with the rights of China . The present treaty relations between that power and the United States spring from an antagonism which arose between our paramount domestic interests and our previous relations . The treaty commonly known as the Burlingame treaty conferred upon Chinese subjects the right of voluntary emigration to the United States for the purposes of curiosity or trade or as permanent residents , and was in all respects reciprocal as to citizens of the United States in China . It gave to the voluntary emigrant coming to the United States the right to travel there or to reside there , with all the privileges , immunities , or exemptions enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation . Under the operation of this treaty it was found that the institutions of the United States and the character of its people and their means of obtaining a livelihood might be seriously affected by the unrestricted introduction of Chinese labor . Congress attempted to alleviate this condition by legislation , but the act which it passed proved to be in violation of our treaty obligations , and , being returned by the President with his objections , failed to become a law . Diplomatic relief was then sought . A new treaty was concluded with China . Without abrogating the Burlingame treaty , it was agreed to modify it so far that the Government of the United States might regulate , limit , or suspend the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States or their residence therein , but that it should not absolutely prohibit them , and that the limitation or suspension should be reasonable and should apply only to Chinese who might go to the United States as laborers , other classes not being included in the limitations . This treaty is unilateral , not reciprocal . It is a concession from China to the United States in limitation of the rights which she was enjoying under the Burlingame treaty . It leaves us by our own act to determine when and how we will enforce those limitations . China may therefore fairly have a right to expect that in enforcing them we will take good care not to overstep the grant and take more than has been conceded to us . It is but a year since this new treaty , under the operation of the Constitution , became part of the supreme law of the land , and the present act is the first attempt to exercise the more enlarged powers which it relinquishes to the United States . In its first article the United States is empowered to decide whether the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States or their residence therein affects or threatens to affect our interests Or to endanger good order , either within the whole country or in any part of it . The act recites that in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities thereof . But the act itself is much broader than the recital . It acts upon residence as well as immigration , and its provisions are effective throughout the United States . I think it may fairly be accepted as an expression of the opinion of Congress that the coming of such laborers to the United States or their residence here affects our interests and endangers good order throughout the country . On this point I should feel it my duty to accept the views of Congress . The first article further confers the power upon this Government to regulate , limit , or suspend , but not actually to prohibit , the coming of such laborers to or their residence in the United States . The negotiators of the treaty have recorded with unusual fullness their understanding of the sense and meaning with which these words were used . As to the class of persons to be affected by the treaty , the Americans inserted in their draft a provision that the words Chinese laborers signify all immigration other than that for teaching , trade , travel , study , and curiosity . The Chinese objected to this that it operated to include artisans in the class of laborers whose immigration might be forbidden . The Americans replied that they could not consent that artisans shall be excluded from the class of Chinese laborers , for it is this very competition of skilled labor in the cities where the Chinese labor immigration concentrates which has caused the embarrassment and popular discontent . In the subsequent negotiations this definition dropped out , and does not appear in the treaty . Article II of the treaty confers the rights , privileges , immunities , and exemptions which are accorded to citizens and subjects of the most favored nation upon Chinese subjects proceeding to the United States as teachers , students , merchants , or from curiosity . The American commissioners report that the Chinese Government claimed that in this article they did by exclusion provide that nobody should be entitled to claim the benefit of the general provisions of the Burlingame treaty but those who might go to the United States in those capacities or for those purposes . I accept this as the definition of the word laborers as used in the treaty . As to the power of legislating respecting this class of persons , the new treaty provides that we may not absolutely prohibit their coming or their residence . The Chinese commissioners gave notice in the outset that they would never agree to a prohibition of voluntary emigration . Notwithstanding this the United States commissioners submitted a draft , in which it was provided that the United States might regulate , limit , suspend , or prohibit it . The Chinese refused to accept this . The Americans replied that they were willing to consult the wishes of the Chinese Government in preserving the principle of free intercourse between the people of the two countries , as established by existing treaties , provided that the right of the United States Government to use its discretion in guarding against any possible evils of immigration of Chinese laborers is distinctly recognized . Therefore if such concession removes all difficulty on the part of the Chinese commissioners but only in that case the United States commissioners will agree to remove the word prohibit from their article and to use the words regulate , limit , or suspend . The Chinese reply to this can only be inferred from the fact that in the place of an agreement , as proposed by our commissioners , that we might prohibit the coming or residence of Chinese laborers , there was inserted in the treaty an agreement that we might not do it . The remaining words , regulate , limit , and suspend , first appear in the American draft . When it was submitted to the Chinese , they said We infer that of the phrases regulate , limit , suspend , or prohibit , the first is a general expression referring to the others . We are entirely ready to negotiate with your excellencies to the end that a limitation either in point of time or of numbers may be fixed upon the emigration of Chinese laborers to the United States . At a subsequent interview they said that by limitation in number they meant , for example , that the United States , having , as they supposed , a record of the number of immigrants in each year , as well as the total number of Chinese now there , that no more should be allowed to go in any one year in future than either the greatest number which had gone in any year in the past , or that the total number should never be allowed to exceed the number now there . As to limitation of time they meant , for example , that Chinese should be allowed to go in alternate years , or every third year , or , for example , that they should not be allowed to go for two , three , or five years . At a subsequent conference the Americans said The Chinese commissioners have in their project explicitly recognized the right of the United States to use some discretion , and have proposed a limitation as to time and number . This is the right to regulate , limit , or suspend . In one of the conferences the Chinese asked the Americans whether they could give them any idea of the laws which would be passed to carry the powers into execution . The Americans answered that this could hardly be done that the United States Government might never deem it necessary to exercise this power . It would depend upon circumstances . If Chinese immigration concentrated in cities where it threatened public order , or if it confined itself to localities where it was an injury to the interests of the American people , the Government of the United States would undoubtedly take steps to prevent such accumulations of Chinese . If , on the contrary , there was no large immigration , or if there were sections of the country where such immigration was clearly beneficial , then the legislation of the United States under this power would be adapted to such circumstances . For example , there might be a demand for Chinese labor in the South and a surplus of such labor in California , and Congress might legislate in accordance with these facts . In general the legislation would be in view of and depend upon the circumstances of the situation at the moment such legislation became necessary . The Chinese commissioners said this explanation was satisfactory that they had not intended to ask for a draft of any special act , but for some general idea how the power would be exercised . What had just been said gave them the explanation which they wanted . With this entire accord as to the meaning of the words they were about to employ and the object of the legislation which might be had in consequence , the parties signed the treaty , in Article I of which The Government of China agrees that the Government of the United States may regulate , limit , or suspend such coming or residence , but may not absolutely prohibit it . The limitation or suspension shall be reasonable , and shall apply only to Chinese who may go to the United States as laborers , other classes not being included in the limitations . Legislation taken in regard to Chinese laborers will be of such a character only as is necessary to enforce the regulation , limitation , or suspension of immigration . The first section of the act provides that From and after the expiration of sixty days next after the passage of this act , and until the expiration of twenty years next after the passage of this act , the coming of Chinese laborers be , and the same is hereby , suspended and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come , or , having so come after the expiration of said sixty days , to remain within the United States . The examination which I have made of the treaty and of the declarations which its negotiators have left on record of the meaning of its language leaves no doubt in my mind that neither contracting party in concluding the treaty of 1880 contemplated the passage of an act prohibiting immigration for twenty years , which is nearly a generation , or thought that such a period would be a reasonable suspension or limitation , or intended to change the provisions of the Burlingame treaty to that extent . I regard this provision of the act as a breach of our national faith , and being unable to bring myself in harmony with the views of Congress on this vital point the honor of the country constrains me to return the act with this objection to its passage . Deeply convinced of the necessity of some legislation on this subject , and concurring fully with Congress in many of the objects which are sought to be accomplished , I avail myself of the opportunity to point out some other features of the present act which . in my opinion , can be modified to advantage . The classes of Chinese who still enjoy the protection of the Burlingame treaty are entitled to the privileges , immunities , and exemptions accorded to citizens and subjects of the most favored nation . We have treaties with many powers which permit their citizens and subjects to reside within the United States and carry on business under the same laws and regulations which are enforced against citizens of the United States . I think it may be doubted whether provisions requiring personal registration and the taking out of passports which are not imposed upon natives can be required of Chinese . Without expressing an opinion on that point , I may invite the attention of Congress to the fact that the system of personal registration and passports is undemocratic and hostile to the spirit of our institutions . I doubt the wisdom of putting an entering wedge of this kind into our laws . A nation like the United States , jealous of the liberties of its citizens , may well hesitate before it Incorporates into its polity a system which is fast disappearing in Europe before the progress of liberal institutions . A wide experience has shown how futile such precautions are , and how easily passports may be borrowed , exchanged , or even forged by persons interested to do so . If it is , nevertheless , thought that a passport is the most convenient way for identifying the Chinese entitled to the protection of the Burlingame treaty , it may still be doubted whether they ought to be required to register . It is certainly our duty under the Burlingame treaty to make their stay in the United States , in the operation of general laws upon them , as nearly like that of our own citizens as we can consistently with our right to shut out the laborers . No good purpose is served in requiring them to register . My attention has been called by the Chinese minister to the fact that the bill as it stands makes no provision for the transit across the United States of Chinese subjects now residing in foreign countries . I think that this point may well claim the attention of Congress in legislating on this subject . I have said that good faith requires us to suspend the immigration of Chinese laborers for a less period than twenty years I now add that good policy points in the same direction . Our intercourse with China is of recent date . Our first treaty with that power is not yet forty years old . It is only since we acquired California and established a great seat of commerce on the Pacific that we may be said to have broken down the barriers which fenced in that ancient Monarchy . The Burlingame treaty naturally followed . Under the spirit which inspired it many thousand Chinese laborers came to the United States . No one can say that the country has not profited by their work . They were largely instrumental in constructing the railways which connect the Atlantic with the Pacific . The States of the Pacific Slope are full of evidences of their industry . Enterprises profitable alike to the capitalist and to the laborer of Caucasian origin would have lain dormant but for them . A time has now come when it is supposed that they are not needed , and when it is thought by Congress and by those most acquainted with the subject that it is best to try to get along without them . There may , however , be other sections of the country where this species of labor may be advantageously employed without interfering with the laborers of our own race . In making the proposed experiment it may be the part of wisdom as well as of good faith to fix the length of the experimental period with reference to this fact . Experience has shown that the trade of the East is the key to national wealth and influence . The opening of China to the commerce of the whole world has benefited no section of it more than the States of our own Pacific Slope . The State of California , and its great maritime port especially , have reaped enormous advantages from this source . Blessed with an exceptional climate , enjoying an unrivaled harbor , with the riches of a great agricultural and mining State in its rear and the wealth of the whole Union pouring into it over its lines of railway , San Francisco has before it an incalculable future if our friendly and amicable relations with Asia remain undisturbed . It needs no argument to show that the policy which we now propose to adopt must have a direct tendency to repel Oriental nations from us and to drive their trade and commerce into more friendly lands . It may be that the great and paramount interest of protecting our labor from Asiatic competition may justify us in a permanent adoption of this policy but it is wiser in the first place to make a shorter experiment , with a view hereafter of maintaining permanently only such features as time and experience may commend . I transmit herewith copies of the papers relating to the recent treaty with China , which accompanied the confidential message of President Hayes to the Senate of the 10th January , 1881 , and also a copy of a memorandum respecting the act herewith returned , which was handed to the Secretary of State by the Chinese minister in Washington .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives of the United States Herewith I return House bill No . 2744 , entitled An act to regulate the carriage of passengers by sea , without my approval . In doing this I regret that I am not able to give my assent to an act which has received the sanction of the majority of both Houses of Congress . The object proposed to be secured by the act is meritorious and philanthropic . Some correct and accurate legislation upon this subject is undoubtedly necessary . Steamships that bring large bodies of emigrants must be subjected to strict legal enactments , so as to prevent the passengers from being exposed to hardship and suffering and such legislation should be made as will give them abundance of space and air and light , protecting their health by affording all reasonable comforts and conveniences and by providing for the quantity and quality of the food to be furnished and all of the other essentials of roomy , safe , and healthful accommodations in their passage across the sea . A statute providing for all this is absolutely needed , and in the spirit of humane legislation must be enacted . The present act , by most of its provisions , will obtain and secure this protection for such passengers , and were it not for some serious errors contained in it it would be most willingly approved by me . My objections are these In the first section , in lines from 13 to 24 , inclusive , it is provided that the compartments or spaces , etc . , shall be of sufficient dimensions to allow for each and any passenger , etc . , 100 cubic feet , if the compartment or space is located on the first deck next below the uppermost deck of the vessel , etc . , or 120 cubic feet for each passenger , etc . , if the compartment or space is located on the second deck below the uppermost deck of the vessel , etc . It shall not be lawful to carry or bring passengers on any deck other than the two decks mentioned , etc . Nearly all of the new and most of the improved ocean steamers have a spar deck , which is above the main deck . The main deck was in the old style of steamers the only uppermost deck . The spar deck is a comparatively new feature of the large and costly steamships , and is now practically the uppermost deck . Below this spar deck is the main deck . Because of the misuse of the words uppermost deck instead of the use of the words main deck by this act , the result will be to exclude nearly all of the large steamships from carrying passengers anywhere but on the main deck and on the deck below , which is the steerage deck , and to leave the orlop , or lower deck , heretofore used for passengers , useless and unoccupied by passengers . This objection , which is now presented in connection with others that will be presently explained , will , if this act is enforced as it is now phrased , render useless for passenger traffic and expose to heavy loss all of the great ocean steam lines and it will also hinder emigration , as there will not be ships enough that could accept these conditions to carry all who may now wish to come . The use of the new and the hitherto unknown term uppermost deck creates this difficulty , and I can not consent to have an abuse of terms like this to operate thus injuriously to these large fleets of ships . The passengers will not be benefited by such a statute , but emigration will be hindered , if not for a while almost prevented for many . Again , the act in the first section , from line 31 to line 35 , inclusive , provides And such passengers shall not be carried or brought in any between decks , nor in any compartment , etc . , the clear height of which is less than 7 feet . Between the decks of all ships are the beams they are about a foot in width . The legal method of ascertaining tonnage for the purpose of taxation is to measure between the beams from the floor to the ceiling . If this becomes a law the space required would be 8 feet from floor to ceiling , and this is impracticable , for in all ships the spaces between decks are adjusted in proportion to the dimensions of the ship and if these spaces between decks are changed so as not to correspond in their proportions with the dimensions of the vessel , the ship will not work well in the sea , her sailing qualities will be injured , and she will be rendered unfit for service . It is only in great ships of vast tonnage that the height between decks can be increased . All the ordinary sized ships are necessarily constructed with 7 feet space in the interval between the beams from the floor to the ceiling . To adopt this act , with this provision , would be to drive out of the service of transporting passengers most all of the steamships now in such trade , and no practical good obtained by it , for really , with the exception of the narrow beam , the space between the decks is now 7 feet . The purpose of the space commanded by the act is to obtain sufficient air and ventilation , and that is actually now given to the passenger by the 7 feet that exists in all of these vessels between floor and ceiling . There is also another objection that I must suggest . In section 12 from line 14 to line 24 , it is provided Before such vessel shall be cleared or may lawfully depart , etc . , the master of said vessel shall furnish , etc , a correct list of all passengers who have been or are intended to be taken on board the vessel , and shall specify , etc . This provision would prevent the clearing of the vessel . Steam vessels start at an appointed hour and with punctuality . Down almost to the very hour of their departure new passengers , other than those who have engaged their passage , constantly come on board . If this provision is to be the law , they must be rejected , for the ship can not , without incurring heavy penalties , take passengers whose names are not set forth on the list required before such vessel shall be cleared . They should be allowed to take such new passengers upon condition that they would furnish an additional list containing such persons 39 names . There are other points of objection of a minor character that might be presented for consideration if the bill could be reconsidered and amended , but the three that I have recited are conspicuous defects in a bill that ought to be a code for such a purpose , dear and explicit , free from all such objections . The practical result of this law would be to subject all of the competing lines of large ocean steamers to great losses . By restricting their carrying accommodations it would also stay the current of emigration that it is our policy to encourage as well as to protect . A good bill , correctly phrased , and expressing and naming in plain , well known technical terms the proper and usual places and decks where passengers are and ought to be placed and carried , will receive my prompt and immediate assent as a public necessity and blessing .<speech_sep>To the Congress of the United States At the threshold of your deliberations I congratulate you upon the favorable aspect of the domestic and foreign affairs of this Government . Our relations with other countries continue to be upon a friendly footing . With the Argentine Republic , Austria , Belgium , Brazil , Denmark , Hayti , Italy , Santo Domingo , and Sweden and Norway no incident has occurred which cars for special comment . The recent opening of new lines of telegraphic communication with Central America and Brazil permitted the interchange of messages of friendship with the Governments of those countries . During the year there have been perfected and proclaimed consular and commercial treaties with Servia and a consular treaty with Roumania , thus extending our intercourse with the Danubian countries , while our Eastern relations have been put upon a wider basis by treaties with Korea and Madagascar . The new boundary survey treaty with Mexico , a trade marks convention and a supplementary treaty of extradition with Spain , and conventions extending the duration of the Franco American Claims Commission have also been proclaimed . Notice of the termination of the fisheries articles of the treaty of Washington was duly given to the British Government , and the reciprocal privileges and exemptions of the treaty will accordingly cease on July 1 , 1885 . The fisheries industries , pursued by a numerous class of our citizens on the northern coasts , both of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , are worthy of the fostering care of Congress . Whenever brought into competition with the like industries of other countries , our fishermen , as well as our manufacturers of fishing appliances and preparers of fish products , have maintained a foremost place . I suggest that Congress create a commission to consider the general question of our rights in the fisheries and the means of opening to our citizens , under just and enduring conditions , the richly stocked fishing waters and sealing grounds of British North America . Question has arisen touching the deportation to the United States from the British Islands , by governmental or municipal aid , of persons unable there to gain a living and equally a burden on the community here . Such of these persons as fall under the pauper class as defined by law have been sent back in accordance with the provisions of our statutes . Her Majesty s Government has insisted that precautions have been taken before shipment to prevent these objectionable visitors from coming hither without guaranty of support by their relatives in this country . The action of the British authorities in applying measures for relief has , however , in so many cases proved ineffectual , and especially so in certain recent instances of needy emigrants reaching our territory through Canada , that a revision of our legislation upon this subject may be deemed advisable . Correspondence relative to the Clayton Bulwer treaty has been continued and will be laid before Congress . The legislation of France against the importation of prepared swine products from the United States has been repealed . That result is due no less to the friendly representations of this Government than to a growing conviction in France that the restriction was not demanded by any real danger to health . Germany still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from America . I extended to the Imperial Government a friendly invitation to send experts to the United States to inquire whether the use of those products was dangerous to health . This invitation was declined . I have believed it of such importance , however , that the exact facts should be ascertained and promulgated that I have appointed a competent commission to make a thorough investigation of the subject . Its members have shown their public spirit by accepting their trust without pledge of compensation , but I trust that Congress will see in the national and international bearings of the matter a sufficient motive for providing at least for reimbursement of such expenses as they may necessarily incur . The coronation of the Czar at Moscow afforded to this Government an occasion for testifying its continued friendship by sending a special envoy and a representative of the Navy to attend the ceremony . While there have arisen during the year no grave questions affecting the status in the Russian Empire of American citizens of other faith than that held by the national church , this Government remains firm in its conviction that the rights of its citizens abroad should be in no wise affected by their religious belief . It is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which now burden our trade with Cuba and Puerto Rico are under consideration by the Spanish Government . The proximity of Cuba to the United States and the peculiar methods of administration which there prevail necessitate constant discussion and appeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities . I regret to say that the just protests of this Government have not as yet produced satisfactory results . The commission appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens against the Spanish Government , after the recognition of a satisfactory rule as to the validity and force of naturalization in the United States , has finally adjourned . Some of its awards , though made more than two years ago , have not yet been paid . Their speedy payment is expected . Claims to a large amount which were held by the late commission to be without its jurisdiction have been diplomatically presented to the Spanish Government . As the action of the colonial authorities which has given rise to these claims was admittedly illegal , full reparation for the injury sustained by our citizens should be no longer delayed . The case of the Masonic has not yet reached a settlement . Manila court has found that the proceedings of which this Government has complained were unauthorized , and it is hoped that the Government of Spain will not withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice should impel it to offer for the unusual severity and unjust action of its subordinate colonial officers in the case of this vessel . The Helvetian Confederation has proposed the inauguration of a class of international treaties for the referment to arbitration of grave questions between nations . This Government has assented to the proposed negotiation of such a treaty with Switzerland . Under the treaty of Berlin liberty of conscience and civil rights are assured to all strangers in Bulgaria . As the United States have no distinct conventional relations with that country and are not a party to the treaty , they should , in my opinion , maintain diplomatic representation at Sofia for the improvement of intercourse and the proper protection of the many American citizens who resort to that country as missionaries and teachers . I suggest that I be given authority to establish an agency and consulate general at the Bulgarian capital . The United States are now participating in a revision of the tariffs of the Ottoman Empire . They have assented to the application of a license tax to foreigners doing business in Turkey , but have opposed the oppressive storage tax upon petroleum entering the ports of that country . The Government of the Khedive has proposed that the authority of the mixed judicial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of the United States accused of crime , who are now triable before consular courts . This Government is not indisposed to accept the change , but believes that its terms should be submitted for criticism to the commission appointed to revise the whole subject . At no time in our national history has there been more manifest need of close and lasting relations with a neighboring state than now exists with respect to Mexico . The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that country shows , by what has already been accomplished , the vast reciprocal advantages which must attend the progress of its internal development . The treaty of commerce and navigation of 1848 has been terminated by the Mexican Government , and in the absence of conventional engagements the rights of our citizens in Mexico now depend upon the domestic statutes of that Republic . There have been instances of harsh enforcement of the laws against our vessels and citizens in Mexico and of denial of the diplomatic resort for their protection . The initial step toward a better understanding has been taken in the negotiation by the commission authorized by Congress of a treaty which is still before the Senate awaiting its approval . The provisions for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by the troops in pursuit of hostile Indians have been prolonged for another year . The operations of the forces of both Governments against these savages have been successful , and several of their most dangerous bands have been captured or dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and Mexican soldiers fighting in a common cause . The convention for the resurvey of the boundary from the Rio Grande to the Pacific having been ratified and exchanged , the preliminary reconnoissance therein stipulated has been effected . It now rests with Congress to make provision for completing the survey and relocating the boundary monuments . A convention was signed with Mexico on July 13 , 1882 , providing for the rehearing of the cases of Benjamin Well and the Abra Silver Mining Company , in whose favor awards were made by the late American and Mexican Claims Commission . That convention still awaits the consent of the Senate . Meanwhile , because of those charges of fraudulent awards which have made a new commission necessary , the Executive has directed the suspension of payments of the distributive quota received from Mexico . Our geographical proximity to Central America and our political and commercial relations with the States of that country justify , in my judgment , such a material increase of our consular corps as will place at each capital a consul general . The contest between Bolivia , Chile , and Peru has passed from the stage of strategic hostilities to that of negotiation , in which the counsels of this Government have been exercised . The demands of Chile for absolute cession of territory have been maintained and accepted by the party of General Iglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty of peace with the Government of Chile in general conformity with the terms of the protocol signed in May last between the Chilean commander and General Iglesias . As a result of the conclusion of this treaty General Iglesias has been formally recognized by Chile as President of Peru and his government installed at Lima , which has been evacuated by the Chileans . A call has been issued by General Iglesias for a representative assembly , to be elected on the 13th of January , and to meet at Lima on the 1st of March next . Meanwhile the provisional government of General Iglesias has applied for recognition to the principal powers of America and Europe . When the will of the Peruvian people shall be manifested , I shall not hesitate to recognize the government approved by them . Diplomatic and naval representatives of this Government attended at Caracas the centennial celebration of the birth of the illustrious Bolivar . At the same time the inauguration of the statue of Washington in the Venezuelan capital testified to the veneration in which his memory is there held . Congress at its last session authorized the Executive to propose to Venezuela a reopening of the awards of the mixed commission of Caracas . The departure from this country of the Venezuelan minister has delayed the opening of negotiations for reviving the commission . This Government holds that until the establishment of a treaty upon this subject the Venezuelan Government must continue to make the payments provided for in the convention of 1866 . There is ground for believing that the dispute growing out of the unpaid obligations due from Venezuela to France will be satisfactorily adjusted . The French cabinet has proposed a basis of settlement which meets my approval , but as it involves a recasting of the annual quotas of the foreign debt it has been deemed advisable to submit the proposal to the judgment of the cabinets of Berlin , Copenhagen , The Hague , London , and Madrid . At the recent coronation of His Majesty King Kalakaua this Government was represented both diplomatically and by the formal visit of a vessel of war . The question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty with Hawaii is now before Congress . I am convinced that the charges of abuses and frauds under that treaty have been exaggerated , and I renew the suggestion of last year s message that the treaty be modified wherever its provisions have proved onerous to legitimate trade between the two countries . I am not disposed to favor the entire cessation of the treaty relations which have fostered good will between the countries and contributed toward the equality of Hawaii in the family of nations . In pursuance of the policy declared by ibis Government of extending our intercourse with the Eastern nations , legations have during the past year been established in Persia , Siam , and Korea . It is probable that permanent missions of those countries will ere long be maintained in the United States . A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither . Treaty relations with Korea were perfected by the exchange at Seoul , on the 19th of May last , of the ratifications of the lately concluded convention , and envoys from the King of Tab Chosen have visited this country and received a cordial welcome . Korea , as yet unacquainted with the methods of Western civilization , now invites the attention of those interested in the advancement of our foreign trade , as it needs the implements and products which the United States are ready to supply . We seek no monopoly of its commerce and no advantages over other nations , but as the Chosenese , in reaching for a higher civilization , have confided in this Republic , we can not regard with indifference any encroachment on their rights . China , by the payment of a money indemnity , has settled certain of the long pending claims of our citizens , and I have strong hopes that the remainder will soon be adjusted . Questions have arisen teaching the rights of American and other foreign manufacturers in China under the provisions of treaties which permit aliens to exercise their industries in that country . On this specific point our own treaty is silent , but under the operation of the most favored nation clause we have like privileges with those of other powers . While it is the duty of the Government to see that our citizens have the full enjoyment of every benefit secured by treaty , I doubt the expediency of leading in a movement to constrain China to admit an interpretation which we have only an indirect treaty right to exact . The transference to China of American capital for the employment there of Chinese labor would in effect inaugurate a competition for the control of markets now supplied by our home industries . There is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigration of Chinese has been violated , intentionally or otherwise , by the officials of China upon whom is devolved the duty of certifying that the immigrants belong to the excepted classes . Measures have been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this supposed infraction , and it is believed that the Government of China will cooperate with the United States in securing the faithful observance of the law . The same considerations which prompted Congress at its last session to return to Japan the Simonoseki indemnity seem to me to require at its hands like action in respect to the Canton indemnity fund , now amounting to 300 , 000 . The question of the general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan has been considered in an international conference held at Tokyo , but without definite result as yet . This Government is disposed to concede the requests of Japan to determine its own tariff duties , to provide such proper judicial tribunals as may commend themselves to the Western powers for the trial of causes to which foreigners are parties , and to assimilate the terms and duration of its treaties to those of other civilized states . Through our ministers at London and at Monrovia this Government has endeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with Great Britain touching the northwestern boundary of that Republic . There is a prospect of adjustment of the dispute by the adoption of the Mannah River as the line . This arrangement is a compromise of the conflicting territorial claims and takes from Liberia no country over which it has maintained effective jurisdiction . The rich and populous valley of the Kongo is being opened to commerce by a society called the International African Association , of which the King of the Belgians is the president and a citizen of the United States the chief executive officer . Large tracts of territory have been ceded to the association by native chiefs , roads have been opened , steamboats placed on the river , and the nuclei of states established at twenty two stations under one flag which offers freedom to commerce and prohibits the slave trade . The objects of the society are philanthropic . It does not aim at permanent political control , but seeks the neutrality of the valley . The United States can not be indifferent to this work nor to the interests of their citizens involved in it . It may become advisable for us to cooperate with other commercial powers in promoting the rights of trade and residence in the Kongo Valley free from the interference or political control of any one nation . In view of the frequency of invitations from foreign governments to participate in social and scientific congresses for the discussion of important matters of general concern , I repeat the suggestion of my last message that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power by the Executive in appointing delegates to such convocations . Able specialists are ready to serve the national interests in such capacity without personal profit or other compensation than the defrayment of expenses actually incurred , and this a comparatively small annual appropriation would suffice to meet . I have alluded in my previous messages to the injurious and vexatious restrictions suffered by our trade in the Spanish West Indies . Brazil , whose natural outlet for its great national staple , coffee , is in and through the United States , imposes a heavy export duty upon that product . Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports by restrictions as to storage and by onerous taxation . For these mischiefs adequate relief is not always afforded by reciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii or that lately negotiated with Mexico and now awaiting the action of the Senate . Is it not advisable to provide some measure of equitable retaliation in our relations with governments which discriminate against our own If , for example , the Executive were empowered to apply to Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Puerto Rico the same rules of treatment and scale of penalties for technical faults which are applied to our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles , a resort to that course might not be barren of good results . The report of the Secretary of the Treasury gives a full and interesting exhibit of the financial condition of the country . It shows that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1883 , amounted to 398 , 287 , 581 . 95 , whereof there was received From customs 214 , 706 , 496 . 93 From internal revenue 144 , 720 , 368 . 98 From sales of public lands 7 , 955 , 864 . 42 From tax on circulation and deposits of national banks 9 , 111 , 008 . 85 From profits on coinage , bullion deposits , and assays 4 , 460 , 205 . 17 From other sources 17 , 333 , 637 . 60 Total 398 , 287 , 581 . 95 For the same period the ordinary expenditures were For civil expenses 22 , 343 , 285 . 76 For foreign intercourse 2 , 419 , 275 . 24 For Indians 7 , 362 , 590 . 34 For Pensions 66 , 012 , 573 . 64 For the military establishment , including river and harbor improvements and arsenals 48 , 911 , 382 . 93 For the naval establishment , including vessels , machinery , and improvements at navy yards 15 , 283 , 437 . 17 For miscellaneous expenditures , including public buildings , light houses , and collecting the revenue 40 , 098 , 432 . 73 For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia 3 , 817 , 028 . 48 For interest on the public debt 59 , 160 , 131 . 25 Total 265 , 408 , 137 . 54 Leaving a surplus revenue of 132 , 879 , 444 . 41 , which , with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the Treasury of 1 , 299 , 312 . 55 , making 134 , 178 , 756 . 96 , was applied to the redemption Of bonds for the sinking fund 44 , 850 , 700 . 00 Of fractional currency for the sinking fund 46 , 556 . 96 Of funded loan of 1881 , continued at 3 12 per cent 65 , 380 , 250 . 00 Of loan of July and August , 1861 , continued at 3 1 2 per cent 20 , 594 , 600 . 00 Of funded loan of 19071 , 418 , 850 . 00 Of funded loan of 1881719 , 150 . 00 Of loan of February , 186118 , 000 . 00 Of loan of July and August , 1861266 , 600 . 00 Of loan of March , 1863116 , 850 . 00 Of loan of July , 188247 , 650 . 00 Of five twenties of 186210 , 300 . 00 Of five twenties of 18647 , 050 . 00 Of five twenties of 18659 , 600 . 00 Of ten forties of 1864133 , 550 . 00 Of consols of 186540 , 800 . 00 Of consols of 1867235 , 700 . 00 Of consols of 1868154 , 650 . 00 Of Oregon War debt 5 , 450 . 00 Of refunding certificates 109 , 150 . 00 Of old demand , compound interest and other notes 13 , 300 . 00 Total 134 , 178 , 756 . 96 The revenue for the present fiscal year , actual and estimated , is as follows Source For the quarter ended September 30 , 1883 actual For the remaining three quarters of the year estimated From customs 57 , 402 , 975 . 67 137 , 597 , 024 . 33 From internal revenue 29 , 662 , 078 . 6090 , 337 , 921 . 40 From sales of public lands 2 , 932 , 635 . 175 , 067 , 634 . 83 From tax on circulation and deposits of national banks 1 , 557 , 800 . 881 , 542 , 199 . 12 From repayment of interest and sinking fund , Pacific Railway companies 521 , 059 . 511 , 478 , 940 . 49 From customs fees , fines , penalties , etc 298 , 696 . 78901 , 303 . 22 From fees consular , letters patent , and lands 863 , 209 . 802 , 436 , 790 . 20 From proceeds of sales of Government property 112 , 562 . 23167 , 437 . 77 From profits on coinage , etc 950 , 229 . 463 , 149 , 770 . 54 From deposits for surveying public lands 172 , 461 . 31327 , 538 . 69 From revenues of the District of Columbia 256 , 017 . 991 , 643 , 982 . 01 From miscellaneous sources 1 , 237 , 189 . 632 , 382 , 810 . 37 Total receipts 95 , 966 , 917 . 03 247 , 033 , 082 . 97 The actual and estimated expenses for the same period are Object For the quarter ended September 30 , 1883 actual For the remaining three quarters of the year estimated For civil and miscellaneous expenses , including public buildings , light houses , and collecting the revenue 15 , 385 , 799 . 42 51 , 114 , 200 . 58 For Indians 2 , 623 , 390 . 544 , 126 , 609 . 46 For pensions 16 , 285 , 261 . 9853 , 714 , 738 . 02 For military establishment , including fortifications , river and harbor improvements , and arsenals 13 , 512 , 204 . 3326 , 487 , 795 . 67 For naval establishment , including vessels and machinery , and improvements at navy yards 4 , 199 , 299 . 6912 , 300 , 700 . 31 For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia 1 , 138 , 836 . 412 , 611 , 163 . 59 For interest on the public debt 14 , 797 , 297 . 9639 , 702 , 702 . 04 Total ordinary expenditures 67 , 942 , 090 . 33 190 , 057 , 909 . 67 Total receipts , actual and estimated 343 , 000 , 000 . 00 Total expenditures , actual and estimated 258 , 000 , 000 . 0085 , 000 , 000 . 00 Estimated amount due the sinking fund 45 , 816 , 741 . 07 Leaving a balance of 39 , 183 , 258 . 93 If the revenue for the fiscal year which will end on June 30 , 1885 , be estimated upon the basis of existing laws , the Secretary is of the opinion that for that year the receipts will exceed by 60 , 000 , 000 the ordinary expenditures including the amount devoted to the sinking fund . Hitherto the surplus , as rapidly as it has accumulated , has been devoted to the reduction of the national debt . As a result the only bonds now outstanding which are redeemable at the pleasure of the Government are the 3 percents , amounting to about 305 , 000 , 000 . The 4 1 2 percents , amounting to 250 , 000 , 000 , and the 737 , 000 , 000 4 percents are not payable until 1891 and 1907 , respectively . If the surplus shall hereafter be as large as the Treasury estimates now indicate , the 3 per cent bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before any of the 4 1 2 percents can be called in . The latter at the same rate of accumulation of surplus can be paid at maturity , and the moneys requisite for the redemption of the 4 percents will be in the Treasury many years before those obligations become payable . There are cogent reasons , however , why the national indebtedness should not be thus rapidly extinguished . Chief among them is the fact that only by excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable . In a communication to the Congress at its last session I recommended that all excise taxes be abolished except those relating to distilled spirits and that substantial reductions be also made in the revenues from customs . A statute has since been enacted by which the annual tax and tariff receipts of the Government have been cut down to the extent of at least fifty or sixty millions of dollars . While I have no doubt that still further reductions may be wisely made , I do not advise the adoption at this session of any measures for large diminution of the national revenues . The results of the legislation of the last session of the Congress have not as yet become sufficiently apparent to justify any radical revision or sweeping modifications of existing law . In the interval which must elapse before the effects of the act of March 3 , 1883 , can be definitely ascertained a portion at least of the surplus revenues may be wisely applied to the long neglected duty of rehabilitating our Navy and providing coast defenses for the protection of our harbors . This is a matter to which I shall again advert . Immediately associated with the financial subject just discussed is the important question what legislation is needed regarding the national currency . The aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit in the Treasury to support the national bank circulation is about 350 , 000 , 000 . Nearly 200 , 000 , 000 of this amount consists of 3 percents , which , as already stated , are payable at the pleasure of the Government and are likely to be called in within less than four years unless meantime the surplus revenues shall be diminished . The probable effect of such an extensive retirement of the securities which are the basis of the national bank circulation would be such a contraction of the volume of the currency as to produce grave commercial embarrassments . How can this danger be obviated The most effectual plan , and one whose adoption at the earliest practicable opportunity I shall heartily approve , has already been indicated . If the revenues of the next four years shall be kept substantially commensurate with the expenses , the volume of circulation will not be likely to suffer any material disturbance but if , on the other hand , there shall be great delay in reducing taxation , it will become necessary either to substitute some other form of currency in place of the national bank notes or to make important changes in the laws by which their circulation is now controlled . In my judgment the latter course is far preferable . I commend to your attention the very interesting and thoughtful suggestions upon this subject which appear in the Secretary s report . The objections which he urges against the acceptance of any other securities than the obligations of the Government itself as a foundation for national bank circulation seem to me insuperable . For averting the threatened contraction two courses have been suggested , either of which is probably feasible . One is the issuance of new bonds , having many years to run , bearing a low rate of interest , and exchangeable upon specified terms for those now outstanding . The other course , which commends itself to my own judgment as the better , is the enactment of a law repealing the tax on circulation and permitting the banks to issue notes for an amount equal to 90 per cent of the market value instead of , as now , the face value of their deposited bonds . I agree with the Secretary in the belief that the adoption of this plan would afford the necessary relief . The trade dollar was coined for the purpose of traffic in countries where silver passed at its value as ascertained by its weight and fineness . It never had a legal tender quality . Large numbers of these coins entered , however , into the volume of our currency . By common consent their circulation in domestic trade has now ceased , and they have thus become a disturbing element . They should not be longer permitted to embarrass our currency system . I recommend that provision be made for their reception by the Treasury and the mints , as bullion , at a small percentage above the current market price of silver of like fineness . The Secretary of the Treasury advises a consolidation of certain of the customs districts of the country , and suggests that the President be vested with such power in relation thereto as is now given him in respect to collectors of internal revenue by section 3141 of the Revised Statutes . The statistics upon this subject which are contained in his report furnish of themselves a strong argument in defense of his views . At the adjournment of Congress the number of internal revenue collection districts was 126 . By Executive order dated June 25 , 1883 , I directed that certain of these districts be consolidated . The result has been a reduction of one third their number , which at present is but 83 . From the report of the Secretary of War it will be seen that in only a single instance has there been any disturbance of the quiet condition of our Indian tribes . A raid from Mexico into Arizona was made in March last by a small party of Indians , which was pursued by General Crook into the mountain regions from which it had come . It is confidently hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur and that the Indian tribes which have for so many years disturbed the West will hereafter remain in peaceable submission . I again call your attention to the present condition of our extended seacoast , upon which are so many large cities whose wealth and importance to the country would in time of war invite attack from modern armored ships , against which our existing defensive works could give no adequate protection . Those works were built before the introduction of modern heavy rifled guns into maritime warfare , and if they are not put in an efficient condition we may easily be subjected to humiliation by a hostile power greatly inferior to ourselves . As germane to this subject , I call your attention to the importance of perfecting our submarine torpedo defenses . The board authorized by the last Congress to report upon the method which should be adopted for the manufacture of heavy ordnance adapted to modern warfare has visited the principal iron and steel works in this country and in Europe . It is hoped that its report will soon be made , and that Congress will thereupon be disposed to provide suitable facilities and plant for the manufacture of such guns as are now imperatively needed . On several occasions during the past year officers of the Army have at the request of the State authorities visited their militia encampments for inspection of the troops . From the reports of these officers I am induced to believe that the encouragement of the State militia organizations by the National Government would be followed by very gratifying results , and would afford it in sudden emergencies the aid of a large body of volunteers educated in the performance of military duties . The Secretary of the Navy reports that under the authority of the acts of August 5 , 1882 , and March 3 , 1883 , the work of strengthening our Navy by the construction of modern vessels has been auspiciously begun . Three cruisers are in process of construction the Chicago , of 4 , 500 tons displacement , and the Boston and Atlanta , each of 2 , 500 tons . They are to be built of steel , with the tensile strength and ductility prescribed by law , and in the combination of speed , endurance , and armament are expected to compare favorably with the best unarmored war vessels of other nations . A fourth vessel , the Dolphin , is to be constructed of similar material , and is intended to serve as a fleet dispatch boat . The double turreted monitors Puritan , Amphitrite , and Terror have been launched on the Delaware River and a contract has been made for the supply of their machinery . A similar monitor , the Monadnock , has been launched in California . The Naval Advisory Board and the Secretary recommend the completion of the monitors , the construction of four gunboats , and also of three additional steel vessels like the Chicago , Boston , and Dolphin . As an important measure of national defense , the Secretary urges also the immediate creation of an interior coast line of waterways across the peninsula of Florida , along the coast from Florida to Hampton Roads , between the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River , and through Cape Cod . I feel bound to impress upon the attention of Congress the necessity of continued progress in the reconstruction of the Navy . The condition of the public Treasury , as I have already intimated , makes the present an auspicious time for putting this branch of the service in a state of efficiency . It is no part of our policy to create and maintain a Navy able to cope with that of the other great powers of the world . We have no wish for foreign conquest , and the peace which we have long enjoyed is in no seeming danger of interruption . But that our naval strength should be made adequate for the defense of our harbors , the protection of our commercial interests , and the maintenance of our national honor is a proposition from which no patriotic citizen can withhold his assent . The report of the Postmaster General contains a gratifying exhibit of the condition and prospects of the interesting branch of the public service committed to his care . It appears that on June 30 , 1883 , the whole number of post offices was 47 , 863 , of which 1 , 632 were established during the previous fiscal year . The number of offices operating under the system of free delivery was 154 . At these latter offices the postage on local matter amounted to 4 , 195 , 230 . 52 , a sum exceeding by 1 , 021 , 894 . 01 the entire cost of the carrier service of the country . The rate of postage on drop letters passing through these offices is now fixed by law at 2 cents per half ounce or fraction thereof . In offices where the carrier system has not been established the rate is only half as large . It will be remembered that in 1863 , when free delivery was first established by law , the uniform single rate postage upon local letters was 1 cent , and so it remained until 1872 , when in those cities where carrier service was established it was increased in order to defray the expense of such service . It seems to me that the old rate may now with propriety be restored , and that , too , even at the risk of diminishing , for a time at least , the receipts from postage upon local letters . I can see no reason why that particular class of mail matter should be held accountable for the entire cost of not only its own collection and delivery , but the collection and delivery of all other classes and I am confident , after full consideration of the subject , that the reduction of rate would be followed by such a growing accession of business as to occasion but slight and temporary loss to the revenues of the Post Office . The Postmaster General devotes much of his report to the consideration in its various aspects of the relations of the Government to the telegraph . Such reflection as I have been able to give to this subject since my last annual message has not led me to change the views which I there expressed in dissenting from the recommendation of the then Postmaster General that the Government assume the same control over the telegraph which it has always exercised over the mail . Admitting that its authority in the premises is as ample as has ever been claimed for it , it would not , in my judgment , be a wise use of that authority to purchase or assume the control of existing telegraph lines , or to construct others with a view of entering into general competition with private enterprise . The objections which may be justly urged against either of those projects , and indeed against any system which would require an enormous increase in the civil service list , do not , however , apply to some of the plans which have lately provoked public comment and discussion . It has been claimed , for example , that Congress might wisely authorize the Postmaster General to contract with some private persons or corporation for the transmission of messages , or of a certain class of messages , at specified rates and under Government supervision . Various such schemes , of the same general nature , but widely differing in their special characteristics , have been suggested in the public prints , and the arguments by which they have been supported and opposed have doubtless attracted your attention . It is likely that the whole subject will be considered by you at the present session . In the nature of things it involves so many questions of detail that your deliberations would probably be aided slightly , if at all , by any particular suggestions which I might now submit . I avow my belief , however , that the Government should be authorized by law to exercise some sort of supervision over interstate telegraphic communication , and I express the hope that for attaining that end some measure may be devised which will receive your approbation . The Attorney General criticises in his report the provisions of existing law fixing the fees of jurors and witnesses in the Federal courts . These provisions are chiefly contained in the act of February 26 , 1853 , though some of them were introduced into that act from statutes which had been passed many years previous . It is manifest that such compensation as might when these laws were enacted have been just and reasonable would in many instances be justly regarded at the present day as inadequate . I concur with the Attorney General in the belief that the statutes should be revised by which these fees are regulated . So , too , should the laws which regulate the compensation of district attorneys and marshals . They should be paid wholly by salaries instead of in part by fees , as is now the case . The change would prove to be a measure of economy and would discourage the institution of needless and oppressive legal proceedings , which it is to be feared have in some instances been conducted for the mere sake of personal gain . Much interesting and varied information is contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior . I particularly call your attention to his presentation of certain phases of the Indian question , to his recommendations for the repeal of the preemption and timber culture acts , and for more stringent legislation to Prevent frauds under the pension laws . The statutes which prescribe the definitions and Punishments of crimes relating to pensions could doubtless be made more effective by certain amendments and additions which are pointed out in the Secretary s report . I have previously referred to the alarming state of illiteracy in certain portions of the country , and again submit for the consideration of Congress whether some Federal aid should not be extended to public primary education wherever adequate provision therefor has not already been made . The Utah Commission has submitted to the Secretary of the Interior its second annual report . As a result of its labors in supervising the recent election in that Territory , pursuant to the act of March 22 , 1882 , it appears that persons by that act disqualified to the number of about 12 , 000 , were excluded from the polls . This fact , however , affords little cause for congratulation , and I fear that it is far from indicating any real and substantial progress toward the extirpation of polygamy . All the members elect of the legislature are Mormons . There is grave reason to believe that they are in sympathy with the practices that this Government is seeking to suppress , and that its efforts in that regard will be more likely to encounter their opposition than to receive their encouragement and support . Even if this view should happily be erroneous , the law under which the commissioners have been acting should be made more effective by the incorporation of some such stringent amendments as they recommend , and as were included in bill No . 2238 on the Calendar of the Senate at its last session . I am convinced , however , that polygamy has become so strongly intrenched in the Territory of Utah that it is profitless to attack it with any but the stoutest weapons which constitutional legislation can fashion . I favor , therefore , the repeal of the act upon which the existing government depends , the assumption by the National Legislature of the entire political control of the Territory , and the establishment of a commission with such powers and duties as shall be delegated to it by law . The Department of Agriculture is accomplishing much in the direction of the agricultural development of the country , and the report of the Commissioner giving the results of his investigations and experiments will be found interesting and valuable . At his instance a convention of those interested in the cattle industry of the country was lately held at Chicago . The prevalence of pleuropneumonia and other contagious diseases of animals was one of the chief topics of discussion . A committee of the convention will invite your cooperation in investigating the causes of these diseases and providing methods for their prevention and cure . I trust that Congress will not fail at its present session to put Alaska under the protection of law . Its people have repeatedly remonstrated against our neglect to afford them the maintenance and protection expressly guaranteed by the terms of the treaty whereby that Territory was ceded to the United States . For sixteen years they have pleaded in vain for that which they should have received without the asking . They have no law for the collection of debts , the support of education , the conveyance of property , the administration of estates , or the enforcement of contracts none , indeed , for the punishment of criminals , except such as offend against certain customs , commerce , and navigation acts . The resources of Alaska , especially in fur , mines , and lumber , are considerable in extent and capable of large development , while its geographical situation is one of political and commercial importance . The promptings of interest , therefore , as well as considerations of honor and good faith , demand the immediate establishment of civil government in that Territory . Complaints have lately been numerous and urgent that certain corporations , controlling in whole or in part the facilities for the interstate carriage of persons and merchandise over the great railroads of the country , have resorted in their dealings with the public to divers measures unjust and oppressive in their character . In some instances the State governments have attacked and suppressed these evils , but in others they have been unable to afford adequate relief because of the jurisdictional limitations which are imposed upon them by the Federal Constitution . The question how far the National Government may lawfully interfere in the premises , and what , if any , supervision or control it ought to exercise , is one which merits your careful consideration . While we can not fail to recognize the importance of the vast railway systems of the country and their great and beneficent influences upon the development of our material wealth , we should , on the other hand , remember that no individual and no corporation ought to be invested with absolute power over the interest of any other citizen or class of citizens . The right of these railway corporations to a fair and profitable return upon their investments and to reasonable freedom in their regulations must be recognized but it seems only just that , so far as its constitutional authority will permit , Congress should protect the people at large in their interstate traffic against acts of injustice which the State governments are powerless to prevent . In my last annual message I called attention to the necessity of protecting by suitable legislation the forests situated upon the public domain . In many portions of the West the pursuit of general agriculture is only made practicable by resort to irrigation , while successful irrigation would itself be impossible without the aid afforded by forests in contributing to the regularity and constancy of the supply of water . During the past year severe suffering and great loss of property have been occasioned by profuse floods followed by periods of unusually low water in many of the great rivers of the country . These irregularities were in great measure caused by the removal from about the sources of the streams in question of the timber by which the water supply had been nourished and protected . The Preservation of such portions of the forests on the national domain as essentially contribute to the equable flow of important water courses is of the highest consequence . Important tributaries of the Missouri , the Columbia , and the Saskatchewan rise in the mountain region of Montana , near the northern boundary of the United States , between the Blackfeet and Flathead Indian reservations . This region is unsuitable for settlement , but upon the rivers which flow from it depends the future agricultural development of a vast tract of country . The attention of Congress is called to the necessity of withdrawing from public sale this part of the public domain and establishing there a forest preserve . The industrial exhibitions which have been held in the United States during the present year attracted attention in many foreign countries , where the announcement of those enterprises had been made public through the foreign agencies of this Government . The Industrial Exhibition at Boston and the Southern Exposition at Louisville were largely attended by the exhibitors of foreign countries , notwithstanding the absence of any professed national character in those undertakings . The Centennial Exposition to be held next year at New Orleans in commemoration of the centenary of the first shipment of cotton from a port of the United States bids fair to meet with like gratifying success . Under the act of Congress of the 10th of February , 1883 , declaring that exposition to be national and international in its character , all foreign governments with which the United States maintain relations have been invited to participate . The promoters of this important undertaking have already received assurances of the lively interest which it has excited abroad . The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia is herewith transmitted . I ask for it your careful attention , especially for those portions which relate to assessments , arrears of taxes , and increase of water supply . The commissioners who were appointed under the act of January 16 , 1883 , entitled An act to regulate and improve the civil service of the United States , entered promptly upon the discharge of their duties . A series of rules , framed in accordance with the spirit of the statute , was approved and promulgated by the President . In some particulars wherein they seemed defective those rules were subsequently amended . It will be perceived that they discountenance any political or religious tests for admission to those offices of the public service to which the statute relates . The act is limited in its original application to the classified clerkships in the several Executive Departments at Washington numbering about 5 , 600 and to similar positions in customs districts and post offices where as many as fifty persons are employed . A classification of these positions analogous to that existing in the Washington offices was duly made before the law went into effect . Eleven customs districts and twenty three post offices were thus brought under the immediate operation of the statute . The annual report of the Civil Service Commission which will soon be submitted to Congress will doubtless afford the means of a more definite judgment than I am now prepared to express as to the merits of the new system . I am persuaded that its effects have thus far proved beneficial . Its practical methods appear to be adequate for the ends proposed , and there has been no serious difficulty in carrying them into effect . Since the 16th of July last no person , so far as I am aware , has been appointed to the public service in the classified portions thereof at any of the Departments , or at any of the post offices and customs districts above named , except those certified by the Commission to be the most competent on the basis of the examinations held in conformity to the rules . At the time when the present Executive entered upon his office his death , removal , resignation , or inability to discharge his duties would have left the Government without a constitutional head . It is possible , of course , that a similar contingency may again arise unless the wisdom of Congress shall provide against its recurrence . The Senate at its last session , after full consideration , passed an act relating to this subject , which will now , I trust , commend itself to the approval of both Houses of Congress . The clause of the Constitution upon which must depend any law regulating the Presidential succession presents also for solution other questions of paramount importance . These questions relate to the proper interpretation of the phrase inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office , our organic law providing that when the President shall suffer from such inability the Presidential office shall devolve upon the Vice President , who must himself under like circumstances give place to such officer as Congress may by law appoint to act as President . I need not here set forth the numerous and interesting inquiries which are suggested by these words of the Constitution . They were fully stated in my first communication to Congress and have since been the subject of frequent deliberations in that body . It is greatly to be hoped that these momentous questions will find speedy solution , lest emergencies may arise when longer delay will be impossible and any determination , albeit the wisest , may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm . For the reasons fully stated in my last annual message I repeat my recommendation that Congress propose an amendment to that provision of the Constitution which prescribes the formalities for the enactment of laws , whereby , in respect to bills for the appropriation of public moneys , the Executive may be enabled , while giving his approval to particular items , to interpose his veto as to such others as do not commend themselves to his judgment . The fourteenth amendment of the Constitution confers the rights of citizenship upon all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof . It was the special purpose of this amendment to insure to members of the colored race the full enjoyment of civil and political rights . Certain statutory provisions intended to secure the enforcement of those rights have been recently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court . Any legislation whereby Congress may lawfully supplement the guaranties which the Constitution affords for the equal enjoyment by all the citizens of the United States of every right , privilege , and immunity of citizenship will receive my unhesitating approval .<speech_sep>To the Congress of the United States Since the close of your last session the American people , in the exercise of their highest right of suffrage , have chosen their Chief Magistrate for the four years ensuing . When it is remembered that at no period in the country s history has the long political contest which customarily precedes the day of the national election been waged with greater fervor and intensity , it is a subject of general congratulation that after the controversy at the polls was over , and while the slight preponderance by which the issue had been determined was as yet unascertained , the public peace suffered no disturbance , but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result . Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American citizen , his love of order , and his loyalty to law . Nothing could more signally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political institutions . Eight years have passed since a controversy concerning the result of a national election sharply called the attention of the Congress to the necessity of providing more precise and definite regulations for counting the electoral vote . It is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting claims to the Presidency shall again distract the country , and I am persuaded that by the people at large any of the measures of relief thus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction . Our relations with all foreign powers continue to be amicable . With Belgium a convention has been signed whereby the scope of present treaties has been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country within the jurisdiction of the other equal rights and privileges in the acquisition and alienation of property . A trade marks treaty has also been concluded . The war between Chile and Peru is at an end . For the arbitration of the claims of American citizens who during its continuance suffered through the acts of the Chilean authorities a convention will soon be negotiated . The state of hostilities between France and China continues to be an embarrassing feature of our Eastern relations . The Chinese Government has promptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens whose property was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton . I renew the recommendation of my last annual message , that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China . The true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country permitting the restriction of Chinese immigration is likely to be again the subject of your deliberations . It may be seriously questioned whether the statute passed at the last session does not violate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return certificates valid under the old law , and who now seem to be debarred from relanding for lack of the certificates required by the new . The recent purchase by citizens of the United States of a large trading fleet heretofore under the Chinese flag has considerably enhanced our commercial importance in the East . In view of the large number of vessels built or purchased by American citizens in other countries and exclusively employed in legitimate traffic between foreign ports under the recognized protection of our flag , it might be well to provide a uniform rule for their registration and documentation , so that the bona fide property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly guarded . Pursuant to the advice of the Senate at the last session , I recognized the flag of the International Association of the Kongo as that of a friendly government , avoiding in so doing any prejudgment of conflicting territorial claims in that region . Subsequently , in execution of the expressed wish of the Congress , I appointed a commercial agent for the Kongo basin . The importance of the rich prospective trade of the Kongo Valley has led to the general conviction that it should be open to all nations upon equal terms . At an international conference for the consideration of this subject called by the Emperor of Germany , and now in session at Berlin , delegates are in attendance on behalf of the United States . Of the results of the conference you will be duly advised . The Government of Korea has generously aided the efforts of the United States minister to secure suitable premises for the use of the legation . As the conditions of diplomatic intercourse with Eastern nations demand that the legation premises be owned by the represented power , I advise that an appropriation be made for the acquisition of this property by the Government . The United States already possess valuable premises at Tangier as a gift from the Sultan of Morocco . As is stated hereafter , they have lately received a similar gift from the Siamese Government . The Government of Japan stands ready to present to us extensive grounds at Tokyo whereon to erect a suitable building for the legation , court house , and jail , and similar privileges can probably be secured in China and Persia . The owning of such premises would not only effect a large saving of the present rentals , but would permit of the due assertion of extraterritorial rights in those countries , and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United States . The failure of Congress to make appropriation for our representation at the autonomous court of the Khedive has proved a serious embarrassment in our intercourse with Egypt and in view of the necessary intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to the participation of this Government as one of the treaty powers in all matters of administration there affecting the rights of foreigners , I advise the restoration of the agency and consulate general at Cairo on its former basis . I do not conceive it to be the wish of Congress that the United States should withdraw altogether from the honorable position they have hitherto held with respect to the Khedive , or that citizens of this Republic residing or sojourning in Egypt should hereafter be without the aid and protection of a competent representative . With France the traditional cordial relationship continues . The colossal statue of Liberty Enlightening the World , the generous gift of the people of France , is expected to reach New York in May next . I suggest that Congressional action be taken in recognition of the spirit which has prompted this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal upon which it is to be placed . Our relations with Germany , a country which contributes to our own some of the best elements of citizenship , continue to be cordial . The United States have extradition treaties with several of the German States , but by reason of the confederation of those States under the imperial rule the application of such treaties is not as uniform and comprehensive as the interests of the two countries require . I propose , therefore , to open negotiations for a single convention of extradition to embrace all the territory of the Empire . It affords me pleasure to say that our intercourse with Great Britain continues to be of a most friendly character . The Government of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for seven years the provisions of the existing reciprocity treaty . Such continuance , in view of the relations of that country to the American system of States , should , in my judgment , be favored . The revolution in Hayti against the established Government has terminated . While it was in progress it became necessary to enforce our neutrality laws by instituting proceedings against individuals and vessels charged with their infringement . These prosecutions were in all cases successful . Much anxiety has lately been displayed by various European Governments , and especially by the Government of Italy , for the abolition of our import duties upon works of art . It is well to consider whether the present discrimination in favor of the productions of American artists abroad is not likely to result , as they themselves seem very generally to believe it may , in the practical exclusion of our painters and sculptors from the rich fields for observation , study , and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed . There is prospect that the long pending revision of the foreign treaties of Japan may be concluded at a new conference to be held at Tokyo . While this Government fully recognizes the equal and independent station of Japan in the community of nations , it would not oppose the general adoption of such terms of compromise as Japan may be disposed to offer in furtherance of a uniform policy of intercourse with Western nations . During the past year the increasing good will between our own Government and that of Mexico has been variously manifested . The treaty of commercial reciprocity concluded January 20 , 1883 , has been ratified and awaits the necessary tariff legislation of Congress to become effective . This legislation will , I doubt not , be among the first measures to claim your attention . A full treaty of commerce , navigation , and consular rights is much to be desired , and such a treaty I have reason to believe that the Mexican Government stands ready to conclude . Some embarrassment has been occasioned by the failure of Congress at its last session to provide means for the due execution of the treaty of July 29 , 1882 , for the resurvey of the Mexican boundary and the relocation of boundary monuments . With the Republic of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded which authorizes the construction by the United States of a canal , railway , and telegraph line across the Nicaraguan territory . By the terms of this treaty 60 miles of the river San Juan , as well as Lake Nicaragua , an inland sea 40 miles in width , are to constitute a part of the projected enterprise . This leaves for actual canal construction 17 miles on the Pacific side and 36 miles on the Atlantic . To the United States , whose rich territory on the Pacific is for the ordinary purposes of commerce practically cut off from communication by water with the Atlantic ports , the political and commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated . It is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and liberality of its provisions will command universal approval at home and abroad . The death of our representative at Russia while at his post at Petersburg afforded to the Imperial Government a renewed opportunity to testify its sympathy in a manner befitting the intimate friendliness which has ever marked the intercourse of the two countries . The course of this Government in raising its representation at Bangkok to the diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship and augurs well for our enlarged intercourse . The Siamese Government has presented to the United States a commodious mansion and grounds for the occupancy of the legation , and I suggest that by joint resolution Congress attest its appreciation of this generous gift . This government has more than once been called upon of late to take action in fulfillment of its international obligations toward Spain . Agitation in the island of Cuba hostile to the Spanish Crown having been fomented by persons abusing the sacred rights of hospitality which our territory affords , the officers of this Government have been instructed to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West and at other points near the Cuban coast . I am happy to say that in the only instance where these precautionary measures were successfully eluded the offenders , when found in our territory , were subsequently tried and convicted . The growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between the Spanish Antilles and their natural market in the United States led to the adoption in January last of a commercial agreement looking to that end . This agreement has since been superseded by a more carefully framed and comprehensive convention , which I shall submit to the Senate for approval . It has been the aim of this negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of productions carried under the flag of either country as to make the intercourse between Cuba and Puerto Rico and ourselves scarcely less intimate than the commercial movement between our domestic ports , and to insure a removal of the burdens on shipping in the Spanish Indies , of which in the past our shipowners and shipmasters have so often had cause to complain . The negotiation of this convention has for a time postponed the prosecution of certain claims of our citizens which were declared to be without the jurisdiction of the late Spanish American Claims Commission , and which are therefore remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment . The speedy settlement of these claims will now be urged by this Government . Negotiations for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the Dominican Republic have been successfully concluded , and the result will shortly be laid before the Senate . Certain questions between the United States and the Ottoman Empire still remain unsolved . Complaints on behalf of our citizens are not satisfactorily adjusted . The Porte has sought to withhold from our commerce the right of favored treatment to which we are entitled by existing conventional stipulations , and the revision of the tariffs is unaccomplished . The final disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not as yet been reached , but I have good reason to expect an early settlement which will provide the means of reexamining the Caracas awards in conformity with the expressed desire of Congress , and which will recognize the justice of certain claims preferred against Venezuela . The Central and South American Commission appointed by authority of the act of July 7 , 1884 , will soon proceed to Mexico . It has been furnished with instructions which will be laid before you . They contain a statement of the general policy of the Government for enlarging its commercial intercourse with American States . The commissioners have been actively preparing for their responsible task by holding conferences in the principal cities with merchants and others interested in Central and South American trade . The International Meridian Conference lately convened in Washington upon the invitation of the Government of the United States was composed of representatives from twenty five nations . The conference concluded its labors on the 1st of November , having with substantial unanimity agreed upon the meridian of Greenwich as the starting point whence longitude is to be computed through 180 degrees eastward and westward , and upon the adoption , for all purposes for which it may be found convenient , of a universal day which shall begin at midnight on the initial meridian and whose hours shall be counted from zero up to twenty four . The formal report of the transactions of this conference will be hereafter transmitted to the Congress . This Government is in frequent receipt of invitations from foreign states to participate in international exhibitions , often of great interest and importance . Occupying , as we do , an advanced position in the world s production , and aiming to secure a profitable share for our industries in the general competitive markets , it is a matter of serious concern that the want of means for participation in these exhibitions should so often exclude our producers from advantages enjoyed by those of other countries . During the past year the attention of Congress was drawn to the formal invitations in this regard tendered by the Governments of England , Holland , Belgium , Germany , and Austria . The Executive has in some instances appointed honorary commissioners . This is , however , a most unsatisfactory expedient , for without some provision to meet the necessary working expenses of a commission it can effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors . An International Inventions Exhibition is to be held in London next May . This will cover a field of special importance , in which our country holds a foremost rank but the Executive is at present powerless to organize a proper representation of our vast national interests in this direction . I have in several previous messages referred to this subject . It seems to me that a statute giving to the Executive general discretionary authority to accept such invitations and to appoint honorary commissioners , without salary , and placing at the disposal of the Secretary of State a small fund for defraying their reasonable expenses , would be of great public utility . This Government has received official notice that the revised international regulations for preventing collisions at sea have been adopted by all the leading maritime powers except the United States , and came into force on the 1st of September last . For the due protection of our shipping interests the provisions of our statutes should at once be brought into conformity with these regulations . The question of securing to authors , composers , and artists copyright privileges in this country in return for reciprocal rights abroad is one that may justly challenge your attention . It is true that conventions will be necessary for fully accomplishing this result but until Congress shall by statute fix the extent to which foreign holders of copyright shall be here privileged it has been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such conventions . For this reason the United States were not represented at the recent conference at Berne . I recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States be so enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our territory and aimed against the peace of a friendly nation . Existing statutes prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict the shipment of explosives , though the enactments in the latter respect were not framed with regard to international obligations , but simply for the protection of passenger travel . All these statutes were intended to meet special emergencies that had already arisen . Other emergencies have arisen since , and modern ingenuity supplies means for the organization of hostilities without open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering parties . I see no reason why overt preparations in this country for the commission of criminal acts such as are here under consideration should not be alike punishable whether such acts are intended to be committed in our own country or in a foreign country with which we are at peace . The prompt and thorough treatment of this question is one which intimately concerns the national honor . Our existing naturalization laws also need revision . Those sections relating to persons residing within the limits of the United States in 1795 and 1798 have now only a historical interest . Section 2172 , recognizing the citizenship of the children of naturalized parents , is ambiguous in its terms and partly obsolete . There are special provisions of law favoring the naturalization of those who serve in the Army or in merchant vessels , while no similar privileges are granted those who serve in the Navy or the Marine Corps . An uniform rule of naturalization such as the Constitution contemplates should , among other things , clearly define the status of persons born within the United States subject to a foreign power section 1992 and of minor children of fathers who have declared their intention to become citizens but have failed to perfect their naturalization . It might be wise to provide for a central bureau of registry , wherein should be filed authenticated transcripts of every record of naturalization in the several Federal and State courts , and to make provision also for the vacation or cancellation of such record in cases where fraud had been practiced upon the court by the applicant himself or where he had renounced or forfeited his acquired citizenship . A just and uniform law in this respect would strengthen the hands of the Government in protecting its citizens abroad and would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of naturalization with foreign countries . The legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular service certain changes and reductions which have been productive of embarrassment . The population and commercial activity of our country are steadily on the increase , and are giving rise to new , varying , and often delicate relationships with other countries . Our foreign establishment now embraces nearly double the area of operations that it occupied twenty years ago . The confinement of such a service within the limits of expenditure then established is not , it seems to me , in accordance with true economy . A community of 60 , 000 , 000 people should be adequately represented in its intercourse with foreign nations . A project for the reorganization of the consular service and for recasting the scheme of extraterritorial jurisdiction is now before you . If the limits of a short session will not allow of its full consideration , I trust that you will not fail to make suitable provision for the present needs of the service . It has been customary to define in the appropriation acts the rank of each diplomatic office to which a salary is attached . I suggest that this course be abandoned and that it be left to the President , with the advice and consent Of the Senate , to fix from time to time the diplomatic grade of the representatives of this Government abroad as may seem advisable , provision being definitely made , however , as now , for the amount of salary attached to the respective stations . The condition of our finances and the operations of the various branches of the public service which are connected with the Treasury Department are very fully discussed in the report of the Secretary . It appears that the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1884 , were From customs 195 , 067 , 489 . 76From internal revenue121 , 586 , 072 . 51From all other sources31 , 866 , 307 . 65Total ordinary revenues 348 , 519 , 869 . 92 The public expenditures during the same period were For civil expenses 22 , 312 , 907 . 71For foreign intercourse1 , 260 , 766 . 37For Indians6 , 475 , 999 . 29For pensions55 , 429 , 228 . 06For the military establishment , including river and harborimprovements and arsenals39 , 429 , 603 . 36For the naval establishment , including vessels , machinery , and improvements at navy yards17 , 292 , 601 . 44For miscellaneous expenditures , including public buildings , light houses , and collecting the revenue43 , 939 , 710 . 00For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia3 , 407 , 049 . 62For interest on the public debt54 , 578 , 378 . 48For the sinking fund46 , 790 , 229 . 50Total ordinary expenditures290 , 926 , 473 . 83Leaving a surplus of57 , 603 , 396 . 09As compared with the preceding fiscal year , there was a net decrease of over 21 , 000 , 000 in the amount of expenditures . The aggregate receipts were less than those of the year previous by about 54 , 000 , 000 . The falling off in revenue from customs made up nearly 20 , 000 , 000 of this deficiency , and about 23 , 000 , 000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts from internal taxation . The Secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which will end June 30 , 1885 , at 330 , 000 , 000 and the total expenditures at 290 , 620 , 201 . 16 , in which sum are included the interest on the debt and the amount payable to the sinking fund . This would leave a surplus for the entire year of about 39 , 000 , 000 . The value of exports from the United States to foreign countries during the year ending June 30 , 1884 , was as follows Domestic merchandise 724 , 964 , 852Foreign merchandise15 , 548 , 757Total merchandise740 , 513 , 609Specie67 , 133 , 383Total exports of merchandise and specie 807 , 646 , 992 The cotton and cotton manufactures included in this statement were valued at 208 , 900 , 415 the breadstuffs at 162 , 544 , 715 the provisions at 114 , 416 , 547 , and the mineral oils at 47 , 103 , 248 . During the same period the imports were as follows Merchandise 667 , 697 , 693Gold and silver37 , 426 , 262Total 705 , 123 , 955 More than 63 per cent of the entire value of imported merchandise consisted of the following articles Sugar and molasses 103 , 884 , 274Wool and woolen manufactures53 , 842 , 292Silk and its manufactures49 , 949 , 128Coffee49 , 686 , 705Iron and steel and manufactures thereof41 , 464 , 599Chemicals38 , 464 , 965Flax , hemp , jute , and like substances , and manufactures thereof33 , 463 , 398Cotton and manufactures of cotton30 , 454 , 476Hides and skins other than fur skins22 , 350 , 906I concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending the immediate suspension of the coinage of silver dollars and of the issuance of silver certificates . This is a matter to which in former communications I have more than once invoked the attention of the National Legislature . It appears that annually for the past six years there have been coined , in Compliance with the requirements of the act of February 28 , 1878 , more than 27 , 000 , 000 silver dollars . The number now outstanding is reported by the Secretary to be nearly 185 , 000 , 000 , whereof but little more than 40 , 000 , 000 , or less than 22 per cent , are in actual circulation . The mere existence of this fact seems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute which has made such fact possible . But there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same direction . The Secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended silver is likely at no distant day to become our sole metallic standard . The commercial disturbance and the impairment of national credit that would be thus occasioned can scarcely be overestimated . I hope that the Secretary s suggestions respecting the withdrawal from circulation of the 1 and 2 notes will receive your approval . It is likely that a considerable portion of the silver now encumbering the vaults of the Treasury might thus find its way into the currency . While trade dollars have ceased , for the present at least , to be an element of active disturbance in our currency system , some provision should be made for their surrender to the Government . In view of the circumstances under which they were coined and of the fact that they have never had a legal tender quality , there should be offered for them only a slight advance over their bullion value . The Secretary in the course of his report considers the propriety of beautifying the designs of our subsidiary silver coins and of so increasing their weight that they may bear their due ratio of value to the standard dollar . His conclusions in this regard are cordially approved . In my annual message of 1882 I recommended the abolition of all excise taxes except those relating to distilled spirits . This recommendation is now renewed . In case these taxes shall be abolished the revenues that will still remain to the Government will , in my opinion , not only suffice to meet its reasonable expenditures , but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable when the results of recent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters those reductions can be most judiciously effected . One of the gravest of the problems which appeal to the wisdom of Congress for solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means for increasing our foreign trade and thus relieving the depression under which our industries are now languishing . The Secretary of the Treasury advises that the duty of investigating this subject be intrusted in the first instance to a competent commission . While fully recognizing the considerations that may be urged against this course , I am nevertheless of the opinion that upon the whole no other would be likely to effect speedier or better results . That portion of the Secretary s report which concerns the condition of our shipping interests can not fail to command your attention . He emphatically recommends that as an incentive to the investment of American capital in American steamships the Government shall , by liberal payments for mail transportation or otherwise , lend its active assistance to individual enterprise , and declares his belief that unless that course be pursued our foreign carrying trade must remain , as it is to day , almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners . One phase of this subject is now especially prominent in view of the repeal by the act of June 26 , 1884 , of all statutory provisions arbitrarily compelling American vessels to carry the mails to and from the United States . As it is necessary to make provision to compensate the owners of such vessels for performing that service after April , 1885 , it is hoped that the whole subject will receive early consideration that will lead to the enactment of such measures for the revival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of Congress may deviseThe 3 per cent bonds of the Government to the amount of more than 100 , 000 , 000 have since my last annual message been redeemed by the Treasury . The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to little over 200 , 000 , 000 , about one fourth of which will be retired through the operations of the sinking fund during the coming year . As these bonds still constitute the chief basis for the circulation of the national banks , the question how to avert the contraction of the currency caused by their retirement is one of constantly increasing importance . It seems to be generally conceded that the law governing this matter exacts from the banks excessive security , and that upon their present bond deposits a larger circulation than is now allowed may be granted with safety . I hope that the bill which passed the Senate at the last session , permitting the issue of notes equal to the face value of the deposited bonds , will commend itself to the approval of the House of Representatives . In the expenses of the War Department the Secretary reports a decrease of more than 9 , 000 , 000 . Of this reduction 5 , 600 , 000 was effected in the expenditures for rivers and harbors and 2 , 700 , 000 in expenditures for the Quartermaster s Department . Outside of that Department the annual expenses of all the Army bureaus proper except possibly the Ordnance Bureau are substantially fixed charges , which can not be materially diminished without a change in the numerical strength of the Army . The expenditures in the Quartermaster s Department can readily be subjected to administrative discretion , and it is reported by the Secretary of War that as a result of exercising such discretion in reducing the number of draft and pack animals in the Army the annual cost of supplying and caring for such animals is now 1 , 108 , 085 . 90 less than it was in 1881 . The reports of military commanders show that the last year has been notable for its entire freedom from Indian outbreaks . In defiance of the President s proclamation of July 1 , 1884 , certain intruders sought to make settlements in the Indian Territory . They were promptly removed by a detachment of troops . During the past session of Congress a bill to provide a suitable fire proof building for the Army Medical Museum and the library of the Surgeon General s Office received the approval of the Senate . A similar bill , reported favorably to the House of Representatives by one of its committees , is still pending before that body . It is hoped that during the coming session the measure may become a law , and that thereafter immediate steps may be taken to secure a place of safe deposit for these valuable collections , now in a state of insecurity . The funds with which the works for the improvement of rivers and harbors were prosecuted during the past year were derived from the appropriations of the act of August 2 , 1882 , together with such few balances as were on hand from previous appropriations . The balance in the Treasury subject to requisition July 1 , 1883 , was 10 , 021 , 649 . 55 . The amount appropriated during the fiscal year 1884 was 1 , 319 , 634 . 62 and the amount drawn from the Treasury during the fiscal year was 8 , 228 , 703 . 54 , leaving a balance of 3 , 112 , 580 . 63 in the Treasury subject to requisition July 1 , 1884 . The Secretary of War submits the report of the Chief of Engineers as to the practicability of protecting our important cities on the seaboard by fortifications and other defenses able to repel modern methods of attack . The time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive , and when the possible result of delay in making such preparation is seriously considered delay seems inexcusable . For the most important cities those whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation adequate defenses , inclusive of guns , may be made by the gradual expenditure of 60 , 000 , 000 a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribution . An appropriation of about one tenth of that amount is asked to begin the work , and I concur with the Secretary of War in urging that it be granted . The War Department is proceeding with the conversion of 10 inch smoothbore guns into 8 inch rifles by lining the former with tubes of forged steel or of coil wrought iron . Fifty guns will be thus converted within the year . This , however , does not obviate the necessity of providing means for the construction of guns of the highest power both for the purposes of coast defense and for the armament of war vessels . The report of the Gun Foundry Board , appointed April 2 , 1883 , in pursuance of the act of March 3 , 1883 , was transmitted to Congress in a special message of February 18 , 1884 . In my message of March 26 , 1884 , I called attention to the recommendation of the board that the Government should encourage the production at private steel works of the required material for heavy cannon , and that two Government factories , one for the Army and one for the Navy , should be established for the fabrication of guns from such material . No action having been taken , the board was subsequently reconvened to determine more fully the plans and estimates necessary for carrying out its recommendation . It has received information which indicates that there are responsible steel manufacturers in this country who , although not provided at present with the necessary plant , are willing to construct the same and to make bids for contracts with the Government for the supply of the requisite material for the heaviest guns adapted to modern warfare if a guaranteed order of sufficient magnitude , accompanied by a positive appropriation extending over a series of years , shall be made by Congress . All doubts as to the feasibility of the plan being thus removed , I renew my recommendation that such action be taken by Congress as will enable the Government to construct its own ordnance upon its own territory , and so to provide the armaments demanded by considerations of national safety and honor . The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the progress which has been made on the new steel cruisers authorized by the acts of August 5 , 1882 , and March 3 , 1883 . Of the four vessels under contract , one , the Chicago , of 4 , 500 tons , is more than half finished the Atlanta , of 3 , 000 tons , has been successfully launched , and her machinery is now fitting the Boston , also of 3 , 000 tons , is ready for launching , and the Dolphin , a dispatch steamer of 1 , 500 tons , is ready for delivery . Certain adverse criticisms upon the designs of these cruisers are discussed by the Secretary , who insists that the correctness of the conclusions reached by the Advisory Board and by the Department has been demonstrated by recent developments in shipbuilding abroad . The machinery of the double turreted monitors Puritan , Terror , and Amphitrite , contracted for under the act of March 3 , 1883 , is in process of construction . No work has been done during the past year on their armor for lack of the necessary appropriations . A fourth monitor , the Monadnock , still remains unfinished at the navy yard in California . It is recommended that early steps be taken to complete these vessels and to provide also an armament for the monitor Miantonomoh . The recommendations of the Naval Advisory Board , approved by the Department , comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4 , 500 tons , one cruiser of 3 , 000 tons , two heavily armed gunboats , one light cruising gunboat , one dispatch vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon , one armored ram , and three torpedo boats . The general designs , all of which are calculated to meet the existing wants of the service , are now well advanced , and the construction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant the necessary authority . The act of Congress approved August 7 , 1882 , authorized the removal to the United States of the bodies of Lieutenant Commander George De Long and his companions of the Jeannette expedition . This removal has been successfully accomplished by Lieutenants Harber and Schuetze . The remains were taken from their grave in the Lena Delta in March , 1883 , and were retained at Yakutsk until the following winter , the season being too far advanced to admit of their immediate transportation . They arrived at New York February 20 , 1884 , where they were received with suitable honors . In pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress approved February 13 , 1884 , a naval expedition was fitted out for the relief of Lieutenant Greely , United States Army , and of the party who had been engaged under his command in scientific observations at Lady Franklin Bay . The fleet consisted of the steam sealer Thetis , purchased in England the Bear , purchased at Johns , Newfoundland , and the Alert , which was generously provided by the British Government . Preparations for the expedition were promptly made by the Secretary of the Navy , with the active cooperation of the Secretary of War . Commander George Coffin was placed in command of the Alert and Lieutenant William Emory in command of the Bear . The Thetis was intrusted to Commander Winfield Schley , to whom also was assigned the superintendence of the entire expedition . Immediately upon its arrival at Upernavik the fleet began the dangerous navigation of Melville Bay , and in spite of every obstacle reached Littleton Island on June 22 , a fortnight earlier than any vessel had before attained that point . On the same day it crossed over to Cape Sabine , where Lieutenant Greely and the other survivors of his party were discovered . After taking on board the living and the bodies of the dead , the relief ships sailed for Johns , where they arrived on July 17 . They were appropriately received at Portsmouth , H . , on August 1 and at New York on August 8 . One of the bodies was landed at the former place . The others were put on shore at Governors Island , and , with the exception of one , which was interred in the national cemetery , were forwarded thence to the destinations indicated by friends . The organization and conduct of this relief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its success . In this the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the Congress of the United States I can not too strongly urge upon its attention the duty of restoring our Navy as rapidly as possible to the high state of efficiency which formerly characterized it . As the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturbed , it is plain that the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by considerations of wise economy , of just regard for our future tranquillity , and of true appreciation of the dignity and honor of the Republic . The report of the Postmaster General acquaints you with the present condition and needs of the postal service . It discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in the rate of letter postage recommended in my message of December 4 , 1882 , and effected by the act of March 3 , 1883 , has been much less than was generally anticipated . My recommendation of this reduction was based upon the belief that the actual falling off in receipts from letter postages for the year immediately succeeding the change of rate would be 3 , 000 , 000 . It has proved to be only 2 , 275 , 000 . This is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to its former volume by the natural increase of sealed correspondence . I confidently repeat , therefore , the recommendation of my last annual message that the single rate postage upon drop letters be reduced to 1 cent wherever the payment of 2 cents is now required by law . The double rate is only exacted at offices where the carrier system is in operation , and it appears that at those offices the increase in the tax upon local letters defrays the cost not only of its own collection and delivery , but of the collection and delivery of all other mail matter . This is an inequality that ought no longer to exist . I approve the recommendation of the Postmaster General that the unit of weight in the rating of first class matter should be 1 ounce instead of one half ounce , as it now is . In view of the statistics furnished by the Department , it may well be doubted whether the change would result in any loss of revenue . That it would greatly promote the convenience of the public is beyond dispute . The free delivery system has been lately applied to five cities , and the total number of offices in which it is now in operation is 159 . Experience shows that its adoption , under proper conditions , is equally an accommodation to the public and an advantage to the postal service . It is more than self sustaining , and for the reasons urged by the Postmaster General may properly be extended . In the opinion of that officer it is important to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free delivery offices may be secured by payment of extraordinary postage . This scheme might be made effective by employment of a special stamp whose cost should be commensurate with the expense of the extra service . In some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to outstrip the Government mail carriers by affording for the prompt transmission of letters better facilities than have hitherto been at the command of the Post Office . It has always been the policy of the Government to discourage such enterprises , and in no better mode can that policy be maintained than in supplying the public with the most efficient mail service that , with due regard to its own best interests , can be furnished for its accommodation . The Attorney General renews the recommendation contained in his report of last year touching the fees of witnesses and jurors . He favors radical changes in the fee bill , the adoption of a system by which attorneys and marshals of the United States shall be compensated solely by salaries , and the erection by the Government of a penitentiary for the confinement of offenders against its laws . Of the varied governmental concerns in charge of the Interior Department the report of its Secretary presents an interesting summary . Among the topics deserving particular attention I refer you to his observations respecting our Indian affairs , the preemption and timber culture acts , the failure of railroad companies to take title to lands granted by the Government , and the operations of the Pension Office , the Patent Office , the Census Bureau , and the Bureau of Education . Allusion has been made already to the circumstance that , both as between the different Indian tribes and as between the Indians and the whites , the past year has been one of unbroken peace . In this circumstance the President is glad to find justification for the policy of the Government in its dealing with the Indian question and confirmation of the views which were fully expressed in his first communication to the Forty seventh Congress . The Secretary urges anew the enactment of a statute for the punishment of crimes committed on the Indian reservations , and recommends the passage of the bill now pending in the House of Representatives for the purchase of a tract of 18 , 000 square miles from the Sioux Reservation . Both these measures are worthy of approval . I concur with him also in advising the repeal of the preemption law , the enactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications touching lapsed grants to railroad companies , and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific railroads under such guaranty as shall effectually secure its ultimate payment . The report of the Utah Commission will be read with interest . It discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that Territory . I still believe that if that abominable practice can be suppressed by law it can only be by the most radical legislation consistent with the restraints of the Constitution . I again recommend , therefore , that Congress assume absolute political control of the Territory of Utah and provide for the appointment of commissioners with such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their hands . In the course of this communication reference has more than once been made to the policy of this Government as regards the extension of our foreign trade . It seems proper to declare the general principles that should , in my opinion , underlie our national efforts in this direction . The main conditions of the problem may be thus stated We are a people apt in mechanical pursuits and fertile in invention . We cover a vast extent of territory rich in agricultural products and in nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manufacture . We have a system of productive establishments more than sufficient to supply our own demands . The wages of labor are nowhere else so great . The scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher moral and intellectual qualities that go to the making of good citizens . Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present needs of the Government . These are the elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which , without unfavorably changing the condition of the workingman , our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets provided for the sale beyond our borders of the manifold fruits of our industrial enterprises . The problem is complex and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or reform . The countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for the United States the natural marts of supply and demand . It is from them that we should obtain what we do not produce or do not produce in sufficiency , and it is to them that the surplus productions of our fields , our mills , and our workshops should flow , under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition . Four paths of policy seem to point to this end First . A series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of America which shall foster between us and them an unhampered movement of trade . The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce , in return for the admission free or under a favored scheme of duties of our own products , the benefits of such exchange to apply only to goods carried under the flag of the parties to the contract the removal on both sides from the vessels so privileged of all tonnage dues and national imposts , so that those vessels may ply unhindered between our ports and those of the other contracting parties , though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade the removal or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries coming within the benefits of the treaties , and the avoidance of the technical restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse with those countries is at present hampered . Secondly . The establishment of the consular service of the United States on a salaried footing , thus permitting the relinquishment of consular fees not only as respects vessels under the national flag , but also as respects vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the treaties . Thirdly . The enactment of measures to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United States . Fourthly . The establishment of an uniform currency basis for the countries of America , so that the coined products of our mines may circulate on equal terms throughout the Whole system of commonwealths . This would require a monetary union of America , whereby the output of the bullion producing countries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver could be adjusted in conformity with the population , wealth , and commercial needs of each . As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock , the surplus production of our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step taken toward the general remonetization of silver . To the accomplishment of these ends , so far as they can be attained by separate treaties , the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed and the favor which this enlarged policy has thus far received warrants the belief that its operations will ere long embrace all , or nearly all , the countries of this hemisphere . It is by no means desirable , however , that the policy under consideration should be applied to these countries alone . The healthful enlargement of our trade with Europe , Asia , and Africa should be sought by reducing tariff burdens on such of their wares as neither we nor the other American States are fitted to produce , and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in return a better market for our supplies of food , of raw materials , and of the manufactures in which we excel . It seems to me that many of the embarrassing elements in the great national conflict between protection and free trade may thus be turned to good account that the revenue may be reduced so as no longer to overtax the people that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome that our shipping interests may be judiciously encouraged , the currency fixed on firm bases , and , above all , such an unity of interests established among the States of the American system as will be of great and ever increasing advantage to them all . All treaties in the line of this policy which have been negotiated or are in process of negotiation contain a provision deemed to be requisite under the clause of the Constitution limiting to the House of Representatives the authority to originate bills for raising revenue . On the 29th of February last I transmitted to the Congress the first annual report of the Civil Service Commission , together with communications from the heads of the several Executive Departments of the Government respecting the practical workings of the law under which the Commission had been acting . The good results therein foreshadowed have been more than realized . The system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in securing competent and faithful public servants and in protecting the appointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment . The law has had the unqualified support of the President and of the heads of the several Departments , and the members of the Commission have performed their duties with zeal and fidelity . Their report will shortly be submitted , and will be accompanied by such recommendations for enlarging the scope of the existing statute as shall commend themselves to the Executive and the Commissioners charged with its administration . In view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commercial community for a national bankrupt law , I hope that the differences of sentiment which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the present session . The pestilence which for the past two years has been raging in the countries of the East recently made its appearance in European ports with which we are in constant communication . The then Secretary of the Treasury , in pursuance of a proclamation of the President , issued certain regulations restricting and for a time prohibiting the importation of rags and the admission of baggage of immigrants and of travelers arriving from infected quarters . Lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law , I approve the recommendation of the present Secretary that the Congress take action in the premises , and I also recommend the immediate adoption of such measures as will be likely to ward off the dreaded epidemic and to mitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily extend to our shores . The annual report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews the operations of the several departments of its municipal government . I ask your careful consideration of its suggestions in respect to legislation , especially commending such as relate to a revision of the civil and criminal code , the performance of labor by persons sentenced to imprisonment in the jail , the construction and occupation of wharves along the river front , and the erection of a suitable building for District offices . I recommend that in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses Grant , late General of the armies of the United States and twice President of this nation , the Congress confer upon him a suitable pension . Certain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient I have now , in obedience to the Constitution , recommended for your adoption . As respects others of no less importance I shall content myself with renewing the recommendations already made to the Congress , without restating the grounds upon which such recommendations were based . The preservation of forests on the public domain , the granting of Government aid for popular education , the amendment of the Federal Constitution so as to make effective the disapproval by the President of particular items in appropriation bills , the enactment of statutes in regard to the filling of vacancies in the Presidential office , and the determining of vexed questions respecting Presidential inability are measures which may justly receive your serious consideration . As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service , I can not refrain from expressing to the members of the National Legislature with whom I have been brought into personal and official intercourse my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and of their harmonious cooperation with the Executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation . And to my fellow citizens generally I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accorded me in my administration of the executive department of this Government .<speech_sep>
