My countrymen , the chief trouble today is that the World War wrought the destruction of healthful competition , left our storehouses empty , and there is a minimum production when our need is maximal . Maximum , not minimum , is the call of America . War never fails to leave depleted storehouses , and always impairs the efficiency of production . War also establishes its higher standards for wages and they abide . I wish the higher wage to abide on one explicit condition that the wage earner will give full return for the wage received . It is the best assurance we can have for a reduced cost of living . I am ready to acclaim the highest standard of pay , but I would be blind to the responsibilities that mark this fateful hour if I did not caution the wage earners of America that mounting wages and decreased production can lead only to industrial and economic ruin . I want somehow to appeal to the sons and daughters of the Republic , to every producer , to join hand and brain in production , honest production , patriotic production . Profiteering is a crime of commission . Underproduction is a crime of omission . We must work our most and best , else the inevitable reaction will bring its train of suffering , disappointment , and reversals . We want to forestall such reactions . We want to hold all advanced ground , and fortify it with general good fortune . Let us return to the necessity for understanding , particularly that understanding that concerns ourselves at home . I decline to recognize any conflict of interest among the participants in industry . The destruction of one is the ruin of the other . The suspicion or rebellion of one unavoidably involves the other . In conflict is disaster , in understanding there is triumph . There is no issue relating to the foundation on which industry is builded because industry is bigger than any element in its modern making . The insistent call is for labor , management , and capital to reach understanding . The human element comes first . I want the employers in industry to understand the aspirations , the convictions , the yearnings of the millions of American wage earners . I want the wage earners to understand the problems , the anxieties , the obligations of management and capital , and all of them must understand their relationship to the people and their obligation to the Republic . Out of this understanding will come the unanimous committal to economic justice and in economic justice lies that social justice which is the highest essential to human happiness . I am speaking as one who has counted the contents of the pay envelope from the viewpoint of the earner , as well as the employer . No one pretends to deny the inequalities which are manifest in modern industrial life . They are less , in fact , than they were before organization and grouping on either side revealed the inequality and conscience has brought more justice than statutes have compelled . But the ferment of the world rivets our thoughts on the necessity of progressive solutions else our generation will suffer the experiments , which means chaos for our day to reestablish God s plan for the great tomorrow .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Conference , the United States welcomes you with unselfish hands . We harbor no fears we have no sordid ends to serve we suspect no enemy we contemplate or apprehend no conquest . Content with what we have , we seek nothing which is another s . We only wish to do with you that finer , nobler thing which no nation can do alone . We wish to sit with you at the table of international understanding and good will . In good conscience we are eager to meet you frankly , and invite and offer cooperation . The world demands a sober contemplation of the existing order and the realization that there can be no cure without sacrifice , not by one of us , but by all of us . I do not mean surrendered rights , or narrowed freedom , or denied aspirations , or ignored national necessities . Our republic would no more ask for these than it would give . No pride need be humbled , no nationality submerged , but I would have a mergence of minds committing all of us to less preparation for war and more enjoyment of fortunate peace . The higher hopes come of the spirit of our coming together . It is but just to recognize varying needs and peculiar positions . Nothing can be accomplished in disregard of national apprehensions . Rather , we should act together to remove the causes of apprehensions . This is not to be done in intrigue . Greater assurance is found in the exchange of simple honesty and directness among men resolved to accomplish as becomes leaders among nations , when civilization itself has come to its crucial test . It is not to be challenged that government fails when the excess of its cost robs the people of the way to happiness and the opportunity to achieve . If the finer sentiments were not urging , the cold , hard facts of excessive cost and the eloquence of economics would urge us to reduce our armaments . If the concept of a better order does not appeal , then let us ponder the burden and the blight of continued competition . It is not to be denied that the world has swung along throughout the ages without heeding this call from the kindlier hearts of men . But the same world never before was so tragically brought to realization of the utter futility of passion s sway when reason and conscience and fellowship point a nobler way . I can speak officially only for our United States . Our hundred millions frankly want less of armament and none of war . Wholly free from guile , sure in our own minds that we harbor no unworthy designs , we accredit the world with the same good intent . So I welcome you , not alone in good will and high purpose , but with high faith . We are met for a service to mankind . In all simplicity , in all honesty and all honor , there may be written here the avowals of world conscience refined by the consuming fires of war , and made more sensitive by the anxious aftermath . I hope for that understanding which will emphasize the guarantees of peace , and for commitments to less burdens and a better order which will tranquilize the world . In such an accomplishment there will be added glory to your flags and ours , and the rejoicing of mankind will make the transcending music of all succeeding time .<speech_sep>There grows on me the realization of the unusual character of this occasion . Our republic has been at war before , it has asked and received the supreme sacrifices of its sons and daughters , and faith in America has been justified . Many sons and daughters made the sublime offering and went to hallowed graves as the Nation s defenders . But we never before sent so many to battle under the flag in foreign land , never before was there the impressive spectacle of thousands of dead returned to find eternal resting place in the beloved homeland . The incident is without parallel in history that I know . These dead know nothing of our ceremony today . They sense nothing of the sentiment or the tenderness which brings their wasted bodies to the homeland for burial close to kin and friends and cherished associations . These poor bodies are but the clay tenements once possessed of souls which flamed in patriotic devotion , lighted new hopes on the battle grounds of civilization , and in their sacrifices sped on to accuse autocracy before the court of eternal justice . We are not met for them , though we love and honor and speak a grateful tribute . It would be futile to speak to those who do not hear or to sorrow for those who cannot sense it or to exalt those who cannot know . But we can speak for country , we can reach those who sorrowed and sacrificed through their service , who suffered through their going , who glory with the Republic through their heroic achievements , who rejoice in the civilization , their heroism preserved . Every funeral , every memorial , every tribute is for the living an offering in compensation of sorrow . When the light of life goes out there is a new radiance in eternity , and somehow the glow of it relieves the darkness which is left behind . Never a death but somewhere a new life never a sacrifice but somewhere an atonement never a service but somewhere and somehow an achievement . These had served , which is the supreme inspiration in living . They have earned everlasting gratitude , which is the supreme solace in dying . No one may measure the vast and varied affections and sorrows centering on this priceless cargo of bodies once living , fighting for , and finally dying for the Republic . One s words fail , his understanding is halted , his emotions are stirred beyond control when contemplating these thousands of beloved dead . I find a hundred thousand sorrows touching my heart , and there is ringing in my ears , like an admonition eternal , an insistent call , It must not be again It must not be again God grant that it will not be , and let a practical people join in cooperation with God to the end that it shall not be . I would not wish a Nation for which men are not willing to fight and , if need be , to die , but I do wish for a nation where it is not necessary to ask that sacrifice . I do not pretend that millennial days have come , but I can believe in the possibility of a Nation being so righteous as never to make a war of conquest and a Nation so powerful in righteousness that none will dare invoke her wrath . I wish for us such an America . These heroes were sacrificed in the supreme conflict of all human history . They saw democracy challenged and defended it . They saw civilization threatened and rescued it . They saw America affronted and resented it . They saw our Nation s rights imperiled and stamped those rights with a new sanctity and renewed security .<speech_sep>My countrymen , the surpassing war of all times has involved us , and found us utterly unprepared in either a mental or military sense . The Republic must awaken . The people must understand . Our safety lies in full realization the fate of the nation and the safety of the world will be decided on the western battlefront of Europe . Primarily the American Republic has entered the war in defense of its national rights . If we did not defend we could not hope to endure . Other big issues are involved but the maintained rights and defended honor of a righteous nation includes them all . Cherishing the national rights the fathers fought to establish , and loving freedom and civilization , we should have violated every tradition and sacrificed every inheritance if we had longer held aloof from the armed conflict which is to make the world safe for civilization . More , we are committed to sacrifice in battle in order to make America safe for Americans and establish their security on every lawful mission on the high seas or under the shining sun . We are testing popular government s capacity for self defense . We are resolved to liberate the soul of American life and prove ourselves an American people in fact , spirit , and purpose , and consecrate ourselves anew and everlastingly to human freedom and humanity s justice . Realizing our new relationship with the world , we want to make it fit to live in , and with might and fright and ruthlessness and barbarity crushed by the conscience of a real civilization . Ours is a small concern about the kind of government any people may choose , but we do mean to outlaw the nation which violates the sacred compacts of international relationships . The decision is to be final . If the Russian failure should become the tragic impotency of nations if Italy should yield to the pressure of military might if heroic France should be martyred on her flaming altars of liberty and justice and only the soul of heroism remain if England should starve and her sacrifices and resolute warfare should prove in vain if all these improbable disasters should attend , even then we should fight on and on , making the world s cause our cause . A republic worth living in is worth fighting for , and sacrificing for , and dying for . In the fires of this conflict we shall wipe out the disloyalty of those who wear American garb without the faith , and establish a new concord of citizenship and a new devotion , so that we should have made a safe America the home and hope of a people who are truly American in heart and soul .<speech_sep>Chairman , the message which you have formally conveyed brings me to a realization of responsibility which is not underestimated . It is a supreme task to interpret the covenant of a great political party , the activities of which are so woven into the history of this Republic . I believe in party government , as distinguished from personal government individual , dictatorial , autocratic , or what not . It was the intent of the founding fathers to give this Republic a dependable and enduring popular government , representative in form , and it was designed to make political parties the effective agencies through which hopes and aspirations and convictions and conscience may be translated into public performance . Popular government has been an inspiration of liberty since the dawn of civilization . Republics have risen and fallen , and a transition from party to personal government has preceded every failure since the world began . Under the Constitution we have the charted the way to security in perpetuity . We know it gave to us the safe path to a developing eminence which no people in the world ever rivaled . It has guaranteed the rule of intelligent , deliberate public opinion expressed through parties . The American achievement under the plan of the fathers is nowhere disputed . The American example has been the model of every republic which glorifies the progress of liberty , and is everywhere the leaven of representative democracy which has expanded human freedom . No one man is big enough to run this great Republic . There never has been one . Such domination was never intended . Tranquility , stability , dependability all are assured in party sponsorship , and we mean to renew the assurances which were rended in the cataclysmal war . Our first committal is the restoration of representative popular government under the Constitution through the agency of the Republican Party . It is not difficult to make ourselves clear on the question of international relationships . We Republicans of the Senate conscious of our solemn oaths and mindful of our constitutional obligations , when we saw the structure of a world supergovernment taking visionary form joined in a becoming warning out of our devotion to this Republic . If the torch of constitutionalism had not been dimmed , the delayed peace of the world and the tragedy of disappointment and Europe s misunderstanding of America easily might have been avoided . The Republicans of the Senate halted the barter of independent American eminence and influence which it was proposed to exchange for an obscure and unequal place in the merged governments of the world . Our party means to hold the heritage of American nationality unimpaired and unsurrendered . The world will not misconstrue . We do not mean to hold aloof , we do not mean to shun a single responsibility of this Republic to world civilization . There is no hate in the American heart . We have no envy , no suspicion , no aversion for any people in the world . We hold to our rights , and mean to defend aye , we mean to sustain the rights of this nation and our citizens alike everywhere under the shining sun . Yet there is the concord of amity and sympathy and fraternity in every resolution . There is a genuine aspiration in every American breast for a tranquil friendship with all the world .<speech_sep>
