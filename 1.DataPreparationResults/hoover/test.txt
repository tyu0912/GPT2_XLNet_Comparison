My countrymen and women of the radio audience Of the untold values of the radio , one is the great intimacy it has brought among our people . Through its mysterious channels we come to wider acquaintance with surroundings and men . The microphone for these few moments has been brought to the President s study in the East Wing of the White House . This room from which I speak was the scene of work and accomplishment of our Presidents for over a century . Into this room first came John Adams , who had taken over the reins of administration of the newly established republic from George Washington . Each President in the long procession of years down to Roosevelt worked at this fireside . In the refurnishing of the White House by Roosevelt , the President s study was moved to another room which was used by our Presidents from Taft to Coolidge . But recent extensions to the White House made it possible for me to restore the President s study to this room , where still lingers the invisible presence of so many of our great men . It is here where the Adamses , father and son , Jefferson , Monroe , Jackson , Grant , McKinley , Roosevelt , and a score of other devoted men worked . Here worked Lincoln . In this room he signed the emancipation of the Negro race from slavery . It is a room crowded with memories of the courage and the high aspirations and the high accomplishment of p . 295 the American Presidents . It is a room in which have been marked many of our national triumphs . The problems of our country today crowd for entry here as they have each day for more than 130 years past . One problem has been ever constant , with each succeeding President that we should maintain and strengthen the will of the Nation and other nations for peace . In this room have been taken those reluctant steps which have led our Nation to war and those willing steps which have again led to peace . Never have we had a President who was either a pacifist or a militarist . Never has there been a President who did not pray that his administration might be one of peace , and that peace should be more assured for his successor . Yet these men have never hesitated when war became the duty of the Nation . And always in these years the thought of our Presidents has been adequate preparedness for defense as one of the assurances of peace . But that preparedness must not exceed the barest necessity for defense or it becomes a threat of aggression against others and thus a cause of fear and animosity of the world . And there are other assurances of peace which have been devised in this room , advanced and supported by our Presidents over the past half century . Great aid has been given by them to the advance of conciliation , arbitration , and judicial determination for settlement of international disputes . These are the steps which prevent war . Lately we and other nations have pledged ourselves never to use war as an instrument of national policy . And there is another such step which follows with impelling logic from those advances . That is the reduction of arms . Some months ago I proposed to the world that we should further reduce and limit naval arms . Today we are engaged in a most hopeful discussion with other governments leading to this end . These are proposals which would preserve our national defenses and yet would relieve the backs of those who toil from gigantic expenditures and the world from the hate and fear which flows from the rivalry in building warships . And daily in this room do I receive evidence of almost universal prayer that this negotiation shall succeed . For confidence that there will be peace is the first necessity of human progress .<speech_sep>I have not anything of any news here to announce . I thought perhaps you might like that I discuss the business situation with you just a little , but not from the point of view of publication at all simply for your own information . I see no particular reasons for making any public statements about it , either directly or indirectly . The question is one somewhat of analysis . We have had a period of over speculation that has been extremely widespread , one of those waves of speculation that are more or less uncontrollable , as evidenced by the efforts of the Federal Reserve Board , and that ultimately results in a crash due to its own weight . That crash was perhaps a little expedited by the foreign situation , in that one result of this whole phenomenon has been the congestion of capital in the loan market in New York in the driving up of money rates all over the world . The foreign central banks having determined that they would bring the crisis to an end , at least so far as their own countries were concerned , p . 367 advanced money rates very rapidly in practically every European country in order to attract capital that had drifted from Europe into New York , back into their own industry and commerce . Incidentally , the effect of increasing discount rates in Europe is much greater on their business structure than it is with us . Our business structure is not so sensitive to interest rates as theirs is . So their sharp advancement of discount rates tended to affect this market , and probably expedited or even started this movement . But once the movement has taken place we have a number of phenomena that rapidly develop . The first is that the domestic banks in the interior of the United States , and corporations , withdraw their money from the call market . There has been a very great movement out of New York into the interior of the United States , as well as some movement out of New York into foreign countries . The incidental result of that is to create a difficult situation in New York , but also to increase the available capital in the interior . In the interior there has been , in consequence , a tendency for interest rates to fall at once because of the unemployed capital brought back into interior points . Perhaps the situation might be clearer on account of its parallel with the last very great crisis , 1907 1908 . In that crash the same drain of money immediately took place into the interior . In that case there was no Federal Reserve System . There was no way to acquaint of capital movement over the country , and the interest rates ran up to 300 percent . The result was to bring about a monetary panic in the entire country . Here with the Federal Reserve System and the activity of the Board , and the ability with which the situation has been handled , there has been a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the rest of the business phenomena in the country . The Board , in cooperation with the banks in New York , has made ample capital available for the call market in substitution of the withdrawals . This has resulted in a general fall of interest rates , not only in the interior , but also in New York , as witness the reduction of the discount rate . So that instead of having a panic rise in interest rates with monetary rise following it , we have exactly the reverse phenomenon we have a fallen interest p . 368 rate . That is the normal thing to happen when capital is withdrawn from the call market through diminution in values . The ultimate result of it is a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the general business phenomenon . In other words , the financial world is functioning entirely normal and rather more easily today than it was 2 weeks ago , because interest rates are less and there is more capital available . The effect on production is purely psychological . So far there might be said to be from such a shock some tendency on the part of people through alarm to decrease their activities , but there has been no cancellation of any orders whatsoever . There has been some lessening of buying in some of the luxury contracts , but that is not a phenomenon itself . The ultimate result of the normal course of things would be that with a large release of capital from the speculative market there will be more capital available for the bond and mortgage market . That market has been practically starved for the last 4 or 5 months . There has been practically no or very little at least of mortgage or bond money available , practically no bond issues of any consequence . One result has been to create considerable reserves of business . A number of States have not been able to place their bonds for construction a number of municipalities with bond issues have been held up because of the inability to put them out at what they considered fair rates . There are a great number of business concerns that would proceed with their activities in expansion through mortgage and bond money which have had to delay . All of which comprises a very substantial reserve in the country at the present time . The normal result will be for the mortgage and bond market to spring up again and those reserves to come in with increased activities . The sum of it is , therefore , that we have gone through a crisis in the stock market , but for the first time in history the crisis has been isolated to the stock market itself . It has not extended into either the production activities of the country or the financial fabric of the country , and for that I think we may give the major credit to the constitution of the Federal Reserve System . And that is about a summary of the whole situation as it stands at this moment .<speech_sep>We are dealing here with a psychological situation to a very considerable degree . It is a question of fear . We have had a collapse in the stock market , out of which a good many people have lost money , and a lot of people who could not afford to , and a lot of unfortunate people have been brought in , the effect of which in the American mind creates an undue state of alarm , because our national thinking naturally goes back to previous occasions when events of that character have had a very considerable bearing upon the business situation , and in its final interpretation it is employment . Now , a great many people lifted their standards of living , and naturally the effect of such a thing tends to decrease consumption particularly for luxury and semi luxury , and those trades are no doubt still affected . But this occasion so far differs from all others in that the credit situation in the country is entirely isolated from it due to the Federal Reserve and the banks , and there is no credit consideration involved . But the natural recovery of increased interest rates by the withdrawal of capital from speculative securities takes that capital ultimately back into industry and commerce . It is ordinarily the tendency of industrial leaders and everyone else to sit back to see what happens and to be a little more cautious in his business than he might otherwise have been that we have to deal with . We have also to deal naturally with some unemployment in the semi necessity trades . But the real problem and the interpretation of it is one of maintenance of employment . This is not a question of bolstering stock markets or stock prices or anything of that kind . We are dealing with the vital question of maintaining employment in the United States and consequently the comfort and standard of living of the people and their ability to buy goods and proceed in the normal course of their lives . So that the purpose of this movement is to disabuse the public mind of the notion that there has been any serious or vital interruption in our economic system , and that it is going to proceed in the ordinary , normal manner , and to get that impression over not by preachment and talks but by definite and positive acts on the part of industry and business and p . 388 the Government and others . As I said before , I do not believe that words ever convince a discouraged person in these situations . The thing that brings him back is courage and the natural sight of other industries and other men going ahead with their programs and business . So I wanted you to get that background upon it all , because it seriously concerns the press to give the confidence to the public that the business fabric is now organizing itself , taking steps on its own responsibility to carry on that it is going to go even farther and stretch itself to meet any possible condition of employment is the thing that will give courage to the public rather than to say to them every day that they should not be alarmed . So that I am trying to get this problem across by action in different industries and other groups rather than by too much talking , and , therefore , I do not want to talk about it . I want the action to speak for itself . These conclusions are not a statement from me . That is the conclusion of those men who were present .<speech_sep>My Countrymen This occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an American citizen . It is a dedication and consecration under God to the highest office in service of our people . I assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of Almighty Providence can I hope to discharge its ever increasing burdens . It is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that I should express simply and directly the opinions which I hold concerning some of the matters of present importance . OUR PROGRESS If we survey the situation of our Nation both at home and abroad , we find many satisfactions we find some causes for concern . We have emerged from the losses of the Great War and the reconstruction following it within creased virility and strength . From this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world . What America has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people . In the large view , we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world . Through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before . The devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere . We are steadily building a new race a new civilization great in its own attainments . The influence and high purposes of our Nation are respected among the peoples of the world . We aspire to distinction in the world , but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives . For wise guidance in this great period of recovery the Nation is deeply indebted to Calvin Coolidge . But all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self government must be safeguarded . The strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease . The most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law . Crime is increasing . Confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing . I am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the American people . I am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the Federal Government to enforce its laws . It is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment . The problem is much wider than that . Many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment . To reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire Federal machinery of justice , the redistribution of its functions , the simplification of its procedure , the provision of additional special tribunals , the better selection of juries , and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift . While the authority of the Federal Government extends to but part of our vast system of national , State , and local justice , yet the standards which the Federal Government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure . We are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our Federal judges and attorneys . But the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present day conditions . Its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals . There is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities , subterfuge , and delay , the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost . Reform , reorganization , and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system , both in civil and criminal sides , have been advocated for years by statesmen , judges , and bar associations . First steps toward that end should not longer be delayed . Rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom , the basis of all ordered liberty , the vital force of progress . It must not come to be in our Republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen , by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law , or by combinations of criminals . Justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized . To consider these evils , to find their remedy , is the most sore necessity of our times . Of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment , part are due to the causes I have just mentioned but part are due to the failure of some States to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many State and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws . With the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor . But a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens . There would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it . We must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime . I have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country . I propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities , but the measure of success that the Government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you , as citizens , extend . The duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their Government to enforce the laws which exist . No greater national service can be given by men and women of good will who , I know , are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship than that they should , by their example , assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor . Our whole system of self government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizen select what laws they will support . The worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law . For our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life , of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws . If citizens do not like a law , their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation their right is openly to work for its repeal . To those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law . Fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people . Their activities must be stopped . A NATIONAL INVESTIGATION I propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our Federal system of jurisprudence , to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it . Its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of Federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable . In the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice as a beginning of more effective organization . The election has again confirmed the determination of the American people that regulation of private enterprise and not Government ownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our relation to business . In recent years we have established a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and public utilities on the other . In the former , our laws insist upon effective competition in the latter , because we substantially confer a monopoly by limiting competition , we must regulate their services and rates . The rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both groups is the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people , and it is just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large . Such regulation should be extended by the Federal Government within the limitations of the Constitution and only when the individual States are without power to protect their citizens through their own authority . On the other hand , we should be fearless when the authority rests only in the Federal Government . The larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders . Our people have in recent years developed a new found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare . It is an advance toward the highest conception of self government . Self government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone . Progress is born of cooperation in the community not from governmental restraints . The Government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self help by itself cooperating with them . Business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service , in stability , in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses . Such progress , however , can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law . There is an equally important field of cooperation by the Federal Government with the multitude of agencies , State , municipal and private , in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health , recreation , education , and the home . We have need further to perfect the means by which Government can be adapted to human service . Although education is primarily a responsibility of the States and local communities , and rightly so , yet the Nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality . Self government can succeed only through an instructed electorate . Our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy . The Nation has marched far beyond that . The more complex the problems of the Nation become , the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction . Moreover , as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and invention , we must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life . We can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people . One civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class . If we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people , we must draw constantly from the general mass . The full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership . In public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era . Many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure . Public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education . The returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits , and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness . The United States fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress , prosperity , and peace are interlocked with the progress , prosperity , and peace of all humanity . The whole world is at peace . The dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world . No suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country . Those who have a true understanding of America know that we have no desire for territorial expansion , for economic or other domination of other peoples . Such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom . Our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples . Superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population , in wealth and power except that of imperialism . They fail to see that the American people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system , a new social system , a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism . They fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning that our people are seeking a larger vision through art , literature , science , and travel that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our Nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man . They fail to see that the idealism of America will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel , but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization . It will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings . We not only desire peace with the world , but to see peace maintained throughout the world . We wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force . The recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations . Its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament , the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world . But its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations . In the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation , arbitration , and judicial settlement . American statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world , the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character . The Permanent Court of International Justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with American ideals and with American statesmanship . No more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment . The reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted . The United States seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court . The way should , and I believe will , be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace . Our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the League of Nations , which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries . They adhere to the belief that the independence of America from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress . I have lately returned from a journey among our sister Republics of the Western Hemisphere . I have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country . We are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them . They are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress . We wish only for the maintenance of their independence , the growth of their stability , and their prosperity . While we have had wars in the Western Hemisphere , yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world . Fortunately the New World is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the Old World . We should keep it so . It is impossible , my countrymen , to speak of peace without profound emotion . In thousands of homes in America , in millions of homes around the world , there are vacant chairs . It would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died . Surely civilization is old enough , surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace . Abroad , to west and east , are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields . Most of these nations have contributed to our race , to our culture , our knowledge , and our progress . From one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions . Their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own . Peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense . Peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies . But it will become a reality only through self restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness . I covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace . In our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties . We maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will , and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people . It follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power . But the government is that of the whole people the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being . The animosities of elections should have no place in our Government , for government must concern itself alone with the common weal . Action upon some of the proposals upon which the Republican Party was returned to power , particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff , cannot in justice to our farmers , our labor , and our manufacturers be postponed . I shall therefore request a special session of Congress for the consideration of these two questions . I shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the Congress . It appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the Constitution the vigorous enforcement of the laws the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by the Government in competition with its citizens the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations the more effective reorganization of the departments of the Federal Government the expansion of public works and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home . These were the more tangible determinations of the election , but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of America . These ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day to day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested . More than this , the Government must , so far as lies within its proper powers , give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations . No one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions . We do know what the attainments of these ideals should be The preservation of self government and its full foundations in local government the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields the maintenance of ordered liberty the denial of domination by any group or class the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity the stimulation of initiative and individuality absolute integrity in public affairs the choice of officials for fitness to office the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty the freedom of public opinion the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths the strengthening of the home the advancement of peace . There is no short road to the realization of these aspirations . Ours is a progressive people , but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience . Ill considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them . But if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals , we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children . This is not the time and place for extended discussion . The questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards they are not the problems of degeneration . They demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement . And that responsibility rests upon you , my countrymen , as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office . Ours is a land rich in resources stimulating in its glorious beauty filled with millions of happy homes blessed with comfort and opportunity . In no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced . In no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure . In no nation is the government more worthy of respect . No country is more loved by its people . I have an abiding faith in their capacity , integrity , and high purpose . I have no fears for the future of our country . It is bright with hope . In the presence of my countrymen , mindful of the solemnity of this occasion , knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves , I beg your tolerance , your aid , and your cooperation . I ask the help of Almighty God in this service to my country to which you have called me .<speech_sep>My fellow citizens This broadcast tonight marks the beginning of the mobilization of the whole Nation for a great undertaking to provide security for those of our citizens and their families who , through no fault of their own , face unemployment and privation during the coming winter . Its success depends upon the sympathetic and generous action of every man and woman in our country . No one with a spark of human sympathy can contemplate unmoved the possibilities of suffering that can crush many of our unfortunate fellow Americans if we shall fail them . The depression has been deepened by events from abroad which are beyond the control either of our citizens or our Government . Although it is but a passing incident in our national life , we must meet the consequences in unemployment which arise from it with that completeness of effort and that courage and spirit for which citizenship in this Nation always has and always must stand . As an important part of our plans for national unity of action in this emergency I have created a great national organization under the leadership of Walter Gifford to cooperate with the Governors , the State and the local agencies , and with the many national organizations of business , of labor , and of welfare , with the churches and our fraternal and patriotic societies so that the countless streams of human helpfulness which have been the mainstay of our country in all emergencies may be directed wisely and effectively . Over a thousand towns and cities have well organized and experienced unemployment relief committees , community chests , or other agencies for the efficient administration of this relief . With this occasion begins the nationwide movement to aid each of these volunteer organizations in securing the funds to meet their task over the forthcoming winter . This organized effort is our opportunity to express our sympathy , to lighten the burdens of the heavy laden , and to cast sunshine into the habitation of despair . The amounts sought by the committee in your town or city are in part to provide work , for it is through work that we wish to give help in keeping with the dignity of American manhood and womanhood . But much of their funds are necessary to provide direct relief to those families where circumstances and ill fortune can only be met by direct assistance . Included in many community appeals are the sums necessary to the vital measures of health and character building , the maintenance of which were never more necessary than in these times . The Federal Government is taking its part in aid to unemployment through the advancement and enlargement of public works in all parts of the Nation . Through these works , it is today providing a livelihood for nearly 700 , 000 families . All immigration has been stopped in order that our burdens should not be increased by unemployed immigrants from abroad . Measures have been adopted which will assure normal credits and thus stimulate employment in industry , in commerce , and in agriculture . The employers in national industries have spread work amongst their employees so that the maximum number may participate in the wages which are available . Our States , our counties , our municipalities , through the expansion of their public works and through tax supported relief activities , are doing their full part . Yet , beyond all this , there is a margin of relief which must be provided by voluntary action . Through these agencies Americans must meet the demands of national conscience that there be no hunger or cold amongst our people . Similar organization and generous support were provided during the past winter in localities where it was necessary . Under the leadership of Colonel Woods , we succeeded in the task of that time . We demonstrated that it could be done . But in many localities our need will be greater this winter than a year ago . While many are affected by the depression , the number who are threatened with privation is a minor percentage of our whole people . This task is not beyond the ability of these thousands of community organizations to solve . Each local organization from its experience last winter and summer has formulated careful plans and made estimates completely to meet the need of that community . I am confident that the generosity of each community will fully support these estimates . The sum of these community efforts will meet the needs of the Nation as a whole . To solve this problem in this way accords with the fundamental sense of responsibility , neighbor to neighbor , community to community , upon which our Nation is founded . The possible misery of helpless people gives me more concern than any other trouble that this depression has brought upon us . It is with these convictions in mind that I have the responsibility of opening this nationwide appeal to citizens in each community that they provide the funds with which , community by community , this task shall be met . The maintenance of a spirit of mutual self help through voluntary giving , through the responsibility of local government , is of infinite importance to the future of America . Everyone who aids to the full extent of his ability is giving support to the very foundations of our democracy . Everyone who from a sympathetic heart gives to these services is giving hope and courage to some deserving family . Everyone who aids in this service will have lighted a beacon of help on the stormy coast of human adversity . The success and the character of nations are to be judged by the ideals and the spirit of its people . Time and again the American people have demonstrated a spiritual quality , a capacity for unity of action , of generosity , a certainty of results in time of emergency that have made them great in the annals of the history of all nations . This is the time and this is the occasion when we must arouse that idealism , that spirit , that determination , that unity of action , from which there can be no failure in this primary obligation of every man to his neighbor and of a nation to its citizens , that none who deserve shall suffer . I would that I possessed the art of words to fix the real issue with which the troubled world is faced in the mind and heart of every American man and woman . Our country and the world are today involved in more than a financial crisis . We are faced with the primary question of human relations , which reaches to the very depths of organized society and to the very depths of human conscience . This civilization and this great complex , which we call American life , is builded and can alone survive upon the translation into individual action of that fundamental philosophy announced by the Savior 19 centuries ago . Part of our national suffering today is from failure to observe these primary yet inexorable laws of human relationship . Modern society cannot survive with the defense of Cain , Am I my brother s keeper No governmental action , no economic doctrine , no economic plan or project can replace that God imposed responsibility of the individual man and woman to their neighbors . That is a vital part of the very soul of a people . If we shall gain in this spirit from this painful time , we shall have created a greater and more glorious America . The trial of it is here now . It is a trial of the heart and the conscience , of individual men and women . In a little over a month we shall celebrate our time honored festival of Thanksgiving . I appeal to the American people to make November 26 next the outstanding Thanksgiving Day in the history of the United States that we may say on that day that America has again demonstrated her ideals that we have each of us contributed our full part that we in each of our communities have given full assurance against hunger and cold amongst our people that upon this Thanksgiving Day we have removed the fear of the forthcoming winter from the hearts of all who are suffering and in distress that we are our brother s keeper . I am on my way to participate in the commemoration of the victory of Yorktown . It is a name which brings a glow of pride to every American . It recalls the final victory of our people after years of sacrifice and privation . This Nation passed through Valley Forge and came to Yorktown .<speech_sep>Chairman and my fellow citizens In accepting the great honor that you have brought to me , I desire to speak so simply and so plainly that every man and woman in the United States who may hear or read my words cannot misunderstand . The last 3 years have been a time of unparalleled economic calamity . They have been years of greater suffering and hardship than any which have come to the American people since the aftermath of the Civil War . As we look back over these troubled years we realize that we have passed through two different stages of dislocation and distress . Before the storm broke we were steadily gaining in prosperity . Our wounds from the war were rapidly healing . Advances in science and invention had opened vast vistas of new progress . Being prosperous , we became optimistic all of us . From optimism some of us went to overexpansion in anticipation of the future , and from overexpansion to reckless speculation . In the soil poisoned by speculation grew those ugly weeds of waste , exploitation , and abuse of financial power . In this overproduction and speculative mania we marched with the rest of the whole world . Then 3 years ago came retribution by the inevitable worldwide slump in the consumption of goods , in prices , and employment . At that juncture it was the normal penalty for a reckless boom such as we have witnessed a score of times in our national history . Through such depressions we have always passed safely after a relatively short period of losses , of hardship , and of adjustment . We have adopted policies in the Government which were fitting to the situation . Gradually the country began to right itself . Eighteen months ago there was a solid basis for hope that recovery was in sight . Then , there came to us a new calamity , a blow from abroad of such dangerous character as to strike at the very safety of the Republic . The countries of Europe proved unable to withstand the stress of the depression . The memories of the world had ignored the fact that the insidious diseases left by the Great War had not been cured . The skill and intelligence of millions in Europe had been blotted out by battle , by disease , and by starvation . Stupendous burdens of national debt had been built up . Poisoned springs of political instability lay in the treaties which closed the war . Fear and hates held armament to double those before the great conflict . Governments were fallaciously seeking to build back by enlarged borrowing , by subsidizing industry and employment from taxes that slowly sapped the savings upon which industry and rejuvenated commerce must be built . Under these strains the financial systems of foreign countries crashed one by one . New blows with decreasing world consumption of goods and from failing financial systems rained upon our people . We are a part of the world the disturbance of whose remotest populations affects our financial system , our employment , our markets , and the prices of our farm products . Thus beginning 18 months ago , the worldwide storm grew rapidly to hurricane force and the greatest economic emergency in all the history of the world . Unexpected , unforeseen , violent shocks with every month brought new dangers and new emergencies to our country . Fear and apprehension gripped the heart of our people in every village and city . If we look back over the disasters of these 3 years , we find that three quarter of the population of the globe has suffered from the flames of revolution . Many nations have been subject to constant change and vacillation of government . Others have resorted to dictatorship or tyranny in desperate attempts to preserve some kind of social order . I may pause for one short illustration of the character of one single destructive force arising from these causes which we have been compelled to meet . That was its effect upon our financial structure . Foreign countries , in the face of their own failures , the failures of their neighbors , not believing that we had either the courage or the ability or the strength to meet this crisis , withdrew from the United States over 2 , 400 million , including a billion of gold . Our own alarmed citizens withdrew over 1 , 600 million of currency from our banks into hoarding . These actions , combined with the fears that they generated , caused a shrinkage of credit available for the conduct of industry and commerce by several times even these vast sums . Its visible expression was the failures of banks and business , the demoralization of security and real property values , of the commodity prices , and of employment . And that was but one of the invading forces of destruction that we have been compelled to meet in the last 18 months . Two courses were open to us . We might have done nothing . That would have been utter ruin . Instead , we met the situation with proposals to private business and to the Congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the Republic . We put that program in action . Our measures have repelled these attacks of fear and panic . We have maintained the financial integrity of the Government . We have cooperated to restore and stabilize the situation abroad . As a nation we have paid every dollar demanded of us . We have used the credit of the Government to aid and protect our institutions , both public and private . We have provided methods and assurances that none suffer from hunger or cold amongst our people . We have instituted measures to assist our farmers and our homeowners . We have created vast agencies for employment . Above all , we have maintained the sanctity of the principles upon which this Republic has grown great . In a large sense the test of the success of our program is simple . Our people , while suffering great hardships , have been and will be cared for . In the long view our institutions have been sustained intact and are now functioning with increasing confidence for the future . As a nation we are undefeated and unafraid . And again above all , government by the people has not been defiled . With the humility of one who by necessity has stood in the midst of this storm I can say with pride that the distinction for these accomplishments belongs not to the Government or to any individual . It is due to the intrepid soul of our people . It is to their character , their fortitude , their initiative , and their courage that we owe these results . We of this generation did not build this great Ship of State . But the policies that we have inaugurated have protected and aided its navigation in this terrible storm . These policies and programs have not been partisan . I gladly give tribute to those members of the Democratic Party in the Congress whose patriotic cooperation against factional and demagogic opposition has assisted in a score of great undertakings . I likewise give credit to Democratic as well as Republican leaders among our citizens for their cooperation and their help . A record of these dangers and these policies of the last 3 years will be set down in the books . Much of it is of interest only to history . Our interest now is in the future . I dwell upon these policies and these programs and problems only where they illustrate the questions of the day and our course for the future . As a government and as a people we still have much to do . We must continue the building of our measures of restoration . We must profit by the lessons of this experience . Before I enter upon a discussion of these policies I wish to say something of my conception of the relations of our Government to the people and the responsibilities of both , particularly as applied to these times . The spirit and the devising of this Government by the people was to sustain a dual purpose on the one hand to protect our people amongst nations and in domestic emergencies by great national power , and on the other to preserve individual liberty and freedom through local self government . The function of the Federal Government in these times is to use its reserve powers and its strength for the protection of citizens and local governments by the support to our institutions against forces beyond their control . It is not the function of the Government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbors , or to relieve private institutions of their responsibilities to the public , or the local government to the States , or the responsibilities of State governments to the Federal Government . In giving that protection and that aid the Federal Government must insist that all of them exert their responsibilities in full . It is vital that the programs of the Government shall not compete with or replace any of them but shall add to their initiative and to their strength . It is vital that by the use of public revenues and public credit in emergencies that the Nation shall be strengthened and not weakened . And in all these emergencies and crises , and in all our future policies , we must also preserve the fundamental principles of our social and our economic system . That system was rounded upon a conception of ordered freedom . The test of that freedom is that there should be maintained an equality of opportunity to every individual so that he may achieve for himself the best to which his character , ability , and ambition entitle him . It is only by the release of initiative , this insistence upon individual responsibility , that we accrue the great sums of individual accomplishment which carry this Nation forward . This is not an individualism which permits men to run riot in selfishness or to override equality of opportunity for others . It permits no violation of ordered liberty . In the race after false gods of materialism men and groups have forgotten their country . Equality of opportunity contains no conception of exploitation by any selfish , ruthless , class minded men or groups . They have no place in the American system . As against these stand the guiding ideals and the concepts of our Nation . I propose to maintain them . The solution of our many problems which arise from the shifting scene of national life is not to be found in haphazard experimentation or by revolution . It must be through organic development of our national life under these ideals . It must secure that cooperative action which brings initiative and strength outside of the Government . It does not follow , because our difficulties are stupendous , because there are some souls timorous enough to doubt the validity and effectiveness of our ideals and our system , that we must turn to a State controlled or State directed social or economic system in order to cure our troubles . That is not liberalism that is tyranny . It is the regimentation of men under autocratic bureaucracy with all its extinction of liberty , of hope , and of opportunity . Of course , no man of understanding says that our system works perfectly . It does not for the human race is not yet perfect . Nevertheless , the movement of true civilization is towards freedom rather than regimentation . And that is our ideal . Ofttimes the tendency of democracy in the presence of national danger is to strike blindly , to listen to demagogues and to slogans , all of which destroy and do not save . We have refused to be stampeded into such courses . Ofttimes democracy elsewhere in the world has been unable to move fast enough to save itself in emergency . There have been disheartening delays and failures in legislation and private action which have added to the losses of our people , yet this democracy of ours has proved its ability to act . Our emergency measures of the last 3 years form a definite strategy dominated in the background by these American principles and ideals , forming a continuous campaign waged against the forces of destruction on an ever widening and a constantly shifting front . Thus we have held that the Federal Government should in the presence of great national danger use its powers to give leadership to the initiative , the courage , and the fortitude of the people themselves , but that it must insist upon individual , community , and State responsibility . That it should furnish leadership to assure the coordination and unity of great existing agencies , governmental and private , for economic and humanitarian action . That where it becomes necessary to meet emergencies beyond the power of these agencies by the creation of new governmental instrumentalities , that they should be of such character as not to supplant or weaken , but rather to supplement and strengthen , the initiative and enterprise of our people . That they must , directly or indirectly , serve all of the people . And above all , that they should be set up in such form that once the emergency is past they can and must be demobilized and withdrawn , leaving our governmental , economic , and social structure strong and whole . We have not feared boldly to adopt unprecedented measures to meet unprecedented violences of the storm . But , because we have kept ever before us these eternal principles of our Nation , the American Government in its ideals is the same as it was when the people gave the Presidency to my trust . We shall keep it so . We have resolutely rejected the temptation , under pressure of immediate events , to resort to those panaceas and short cuts which , even if temporarily successful , would ultimately undermine and weaken what has slowly been built and molded by experience and effort throughout these 150 years . It was in accordance with these principles that at the first stage of the depression I called upon the leaders of business and of labor and of agriculture to meet with me and induced them , by their own initiative , to organize against the panic with all its devastating destruction to uphold wages until the cost of living was adjusted to spread existing employment through shortened hours and to advance construction work against future need . It was in pursuance of that same policy that I have each winter thereafter assumed the leadership in mobilizing all of the voluntary and official organizations throughout the country to prevent suffering from hunger and cold , and to protect millions of families stricken by drought . And when it became advisable to strengthen the States who could no longer carry the full burden of relief to distress , it was in accordance with these principles that we held that the Federal Government should do so through loans to the States and thus maintain the fundamental responsibility of the States themselves . We stopped the attempt to turn this effort to the politics of selfish sectional demands , and we kept it based upon human need . It was in accordance with these principles that , in aid to unemployment , we expend some 600 millions in Federal construction of such public works as can be justified as bringing early and definite returns . We have opposed the distortion of these needed works into pork barrel nonproductive works which impoverish the Nation . It is in accord with these principles and these purposes that we have made provision for 1 , 500 millions of loans to self supporting works so that we may increase employment in productive labor . We rejected projects of wasteful nonproductive work allocated for purposes of attracting votes instead of affording relief . Thereby , instead of wasteful drain upon the taxpayer , we secured the return of their cost to Government agencies and at the same time we increased the wealth of the Nation . It was in accordance with these principles that we have strengthened the capital of the Federal land banks that , on the one hand , confidence in their securities should not be impaired , and that on the other , the farmers indebted to them should not be unduly deprived of their homes . It was in accordance with these purposes that the Farm Board by emergency loan to farmers cooperatives served to stem panics in agricultural prices and saved hundreds of thousands of farmers and their creditors from bankruptcy . It was in accord with these ideas that we have created agencies to prevent bankruptcy and failure in their cooperative organizations that we are erecting new instrumentalities to give credit facilities for their livestock growers and their orderly marketing of their farm products . It is in accordance with these principles that in the face of the looming European crises we sought to change the trend of European economic degeneration by our proposals of the German moratorium and the standstill agreements on German private debts . We stemmed the tide of collapse in Germany and the consequent ruin of its people . In furtherance of world stability we have made proposals to reduce the cost of world armaments by 1 billion a year . It was in accordance with these principles that I first secured the creation by private initiative of the National Credit Association , whose efforts prevented the failure of hundreds of banks , and the loss to countless thousands of depositors who had loaned all of their savings to them . It was in accord with these ideas that as the storm grew in intensity we created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation with a capital of 2 billions more to uphold the credit structure of the Nation , and by thus raising the shield of Government credit we prevented the wholesale failure of banks , of insurance companies , of building and loan associations , of farm mortgage associations , and of railroads in all of which the public interest is paramount . This disaster has been averted through the saving of more than 5 , 000 institutions and the knowledge that adequate assistance was available to tide others over the stress . This has been done not to save a few stockholders , but to save 25 millions of American families , every one of whose very savings and employment might have been wiped out and whose whole future would have been blighted had these institutions gone down . It was in accordance with these principles that we expanded the functions and the powers of the Federal Reserve banks that they might counteract the stupendous shrinkage of credit due to fear and to hoarding and the foreign withdrawal of our resources . It was in accordance with these principles that we are now in process of establishing a new system of home loan banks so that through added strength and through cooperation between the building and loan associations , the savings banks and other institutes we may relax the pressures on forfeiture of homes and procure the release of new resources for the construction of more homes and the employment of more men . It was in accordance with these principles that we have insisted upon a reduction of governmental expenses , for no country can squander itself to prosperity on the ruins of its taxpayers . And it was in accordance with these purposes that we have sought new revenues to equalize the diminishing income of the Government in order that the power of the Federal Government to meet the emergency should be impregnable . It was in accordance with these principles that we have joined in the development of a world economic conference to bulwark the whole international fabric of finance , of monetary values , and the expansion of world commerce . It was in accordance with these principles and these policies that I am today organizing the private industrial and financial resources of the country to cooperate effectively with the vast governmental instrumentalities which we have in motion , so that through their united and coordinated efforts we may move from defense to a powerful attack upon the depression along the whole national front . These programs , unparalleled in the history of depressions of any country and in any time , to care for distress , to provide employment , to aid agriculture , to maintain the financial stability of the country , to safeguard the savings of the people , to protect their homes , are not in the past tense they are in action . I shall propose such other measures , public and private , as may be necessary from time to time to meet the changing situations that may occur and to further speed our economic recovery . That recovery may be slow , but we shall succeed . And come what may , I shall maintain through all these measures the sanctity of the great principles under which the Republic over a period of 150 years has grown to be the greatest Nation of the Earth . I should like to digress a second for an observation on the last 3 years which should exhilarate the faith of every American and that is the profound growth of the sense of social responsibility in our Nation which this depression has demonstrated . No Government in Washington has hitherto considered that it held so broad a responsibility for leadership in such times . Despite hardships , the devotion of our men and women to those in distress is demonstrated by the national averages of infant mortality , general mortality , and sickness , which are less today than in times even of prosperity . For the first time in the history of depressions , dividends and profits and the cost of living have been reduced before wages have been sacrificed . We have been more free from industrial conflict through strikes and lockouts and all forms of social disorder than even in normal times . The Nation is building the initiative of men and of women toward new fields of social cooperation and new fields of endeavor . So much for the great national emergency and the principles of government for which we stand and their application to the measures we have taken . There are national policies wider than the emergency , wider than the economic horizon . They are set forth in our platform . Having had the responsibility of this office , my views upon most of them are clearly and often set forth in public record . I may , however , summarize some of them . First I am squarely for a protective tariff . I am against the proposal of a competitive tariff for revenue as advocated by our opponents . That would place our farmers and our workers in competition with peasant and sweated labor products from abroad . Second I am against their proposals to destroy the usefulness of the bipartisan Tariff Commission , the establishment of whose effective powers we secured during this administration just 25 years after it was first advocated by President Theodore Roosevelt . That instrumentality enables us to correct any injustice and to readjust the rates of duty to shifting economic change , without constant tinkering and orgies of logrolling by Congress . If our opponents will descend from the vague generalization to any particular schedule , if it be higher than necessary to protect our people or insufficient for their protection , it can be remedied by this bipartisan Commission without a national election . Third My views in opposition to the cancellation of the war debt are a matter of detailed record in many public statements and in a recent message to the Congress . They mark a continuity of that policy maintained by my predecessors . I am hopeful of such drastic reduction of world armament as will save the taxpayers in debtor countries a large part of the cost of their payments to us . If for any particular annual payment we were offered some other tangible form of compensation , such as the expansion of markets for American agriculture and labor , and the restoration and maintenance of our prosperity , then I am sure our citizens would consider such a proposal . But it is a certainty that these debts must not be canceled or these burdens transferred to the backs of the American people . Fourth I insist upon an army and navy of a strength which guarantees that no foreign soldier will land upon the American soil . That strength is relative to other nations . I favor every arms reduction which preserves that relationship . I favor rigidly restricted immigration . I have by executive direction in order to relieve us of added unemployment , already reduced the inward movement to less than the outward movement . I shall adhere to that policy . Sixth I have repeatedly recommended to the Congress a revision of railway transportation laws , in order that we may create greater stability and greater assurance of that vital service in our transportation . I shall Persist in it . I have repeatedly recommended the Federal regulation of interstate power . I shall persist in that . I have opposed the Federal Government undertaking the operation of the power business . I shall continue in that opposition . I have for years supported the conservation of national resources . I have made frequent recommendations to the Congress in respect thereto , including legislation to correct the waste and destruction of these resources through the present interpretations of the antitrust laws . I shall continue to urge such action . This depression has exposed many weaknesses in our economic system . There has been exploitation and abuse of financial power . We will fearlessly and unremittingly reform these abuses . I have recommended to the Congress the reform of our banking laws . Unfortunately this legislation has not yet been enacted . The American people must have protection from insecure banking through a stronger banking system . They must be relieved from conditions which permit the credit machinery of the country to be made available without check for wholesale speculation in securities with ruinous consequence to millions of our citizens and to our national economy . I have recommended to Congress methods of emergency relief to the depositors of closed banks . For 7 years I have repeatedly warned against private loans abroad for nonproductive purposes . I shall persist in all those matters . I have insisted upon a balanced budget as the foundation of all public and private financial stability and of all public confidence . I shall insist on the maintenance of that policy . Recent increases in revenues , while temporary , should be again examined , and if they tend to sap the vitality of industry , and thus retard employment , they should be revised . The first necessity of the Nation , the wealth and income of whose citizens has been reduced , is to reduce the expenditures on government national , State , and local . It is in the relief of taxes from the backs of men through which we liberate their powers . It is through lower expenditures that we get lower taxes . This must be done . A considerable reduction in Federal expenditures has been attained . If we except those extraordinary expenditures imposed upon us by the depression , it will be found that the Federal Government is operating some 200 million less annually today than 4 years ago . The Congress rejected recommendations from the administration which would have saved an additional 150 million this fiscal year . The opposition leadership insisted , as the price of vital reconstruction legislation and over the protest of our leaders , upon adding 300 million of costs to the taxpayer through public works inadvisable at this time . I shall repeat these proposals for economy . The opposition leadership in the House of Representatives in the last 4 months secured the passage by that House of 3 billion in raids upon the Public Treasury . They have been stopped , and I shall continue to oppose such raids . I have repeatedly for 7 years urged the Congress either themselves to abolish obsolete bureaus and commissions and to reorganize the whole Government structure in the interest of economy , or to give someone the authority to do it . I have succeeded partially in securing that authority , but I regret that no great act under it can be effective until after the approval of the next Congress . With the collapse of world prices and the depreciated currencies the farmer was never so dependent upon his tariff protection for recovery as he is at the present time . We shall hold to that as a national policy . We have enacted many measures of emergency relief to agriculture . They are having their effect . I shall keep them functioning until the strain is past . The original purpose of the Farm Board was to strengthen the efforts of the farmer to establish his own farmer owned , farmer controlled marketing agencies . It has greatly succeeded in this purpose , even in these times of adversity . The departure of the Farm Board from its original purpose by making loans to farmers cooperatives to preserve prices from panic served an emergency , but such an action in normal times is absolutely destructive of the farmers own interest . We still have vast problems to solve in agriculture . But no power on Earth can restore prices except by restoration of the general recovery and by restoration of markets . Every measure that we have taken looking to general recovery is of benefit to the farmer . There is no relief to the farmer by extending governmental bureaucracy to control his production and thus to curtail his liberties , nor by subsidies that bring only more bureaucracy and their ultimate collapse . And I shall continue to oppose them . The most practicable relief to the farmer today aside from general economic recovery is a definite program of readjustment and coordination of national , State , and local taxation which will relieve real property , especially the farms , from the unfair burdens of taxation which the current readjustment in values have brought about . To that purpose I propose to devote myself . I have always favored the development of rivers and harbors and highways . These improvements have been greatly expedited in the last 30 years . We shall continue that work to completion . After 20 years of discussion between the United States and our great neighbor to the north , I have signed a treaty for the construction of the Great Lakes Lawrence seaway . That treaty does not injure the Chicago to the Gulf waterway , the work upon which , together with the whole Mississippi system , I have expedited , and in which I am equally interested . We shall undertake this great seaway , the greatest public improvement ever undertaken upon our continent , with its consequent employment of men as quickly as that treaty can be ratified . Our views upon sound currency require no elucidation . They are indelibly a part of Republican history and policies . We have affirmed them by preventing the Democratic majority in the House from effecting wild schemes of uncontrolled inflation in the last 4 months . There are many other important subjects set forth in the platform and in my public statements in the past for which I will not take your time . There are one or two others that do merit some emphasis . The leadership of the Federal Government is not to be confined to economic and international questions . There are problems of the home and the education of children and of citizenship . They are the most vital of all to the future of the Nation . Except in the case of aids to States which I have recommended for stimulation of the protection and health of children , they are not matters of legislation . We have given leadership to the initiative of our people for social advancement through this organization against illiteracy , through the White House conferences on the protection and health of children , through the national conferences on homeownership , through the stimulation of social and recreational agencies . These are the visible evidences of spiritual leadership in the Government . They will be continued , and they will be constantly invigorated . My foreign policies have been devoted to strengthening the foundations of world peace . We inaugurated the London Naval Treaty which reduced arms and limited the ratios between the fleets of the three powers . We have made concrete proposals at Geneva to reduce the armaments of the world by one third . It would save the taxpayers of the world a billion a year . We could save ourselves 200 millions a year . It would reduce fear and danger of war . We have expanded the arbitration of disputes . I have recommended joining the World Court under proper reservations preserving our freedom of action . Above all , we have given leadership in the transforming of the Kellogg Briand Pact from an inspiring outlawry of war to an organized instrument for peaceful settlements backed by definite mobilized world public opinion against aggression . We shall , under the spirit of that pact , consult with other nations in time of emergency to promote world peace . We shall enter into no agreements committing us to any future course of action or which call for use of force in order to preserve peace . I have projected a new doctrine into international affairs the doctrine that we do not and never will recognize title to the possession of territory gained in violation of the peace pacts which were signed with us . That doctrine has been accepted by all the nations of the world on a recent critical occasion , and within the last few days has been again accepted by all the nations of the Western Hemisphere . That is public opinion made tangible and effective . The world needs peace . It must have peace with justice . I shall continue to strive unceasingly , with every power of mind and spirit , to explore every possible path that leads towards a world in which right triumphs over force , in which reason rules over passion , in which men and women may rear their children not to be devoured by war but to pursue in safety the nobler arts of peace . I shall continue to build upon these designs . Across the path of the Nation s consideration of these vast problems of economic and social order there has arisen a bitter controversy over the control of the liquor traffic . I have always sympathized with the high purpose of the 18th amendment , and I have used every power at my command to make it effective over this entire country . I have hoped that it was the final solution of the evils of the liquor traffic against which our people have striven for generations . It has succeeded in great measure in those many communities where the majority sentiment is favorable to it . But in other and increasing numbers of communities there is a majority sentiment unfavorable to it . Laws which are opposed by the majority sentiment create resentments which undermine enforcement and in the end produce degeneration and crime . Our opponents pledge the members of their party to destroy every vestige of constitutional and effective Federal control of the traffic . That means that over large areas the return of the saloon system with its corruption , its moral and social abuse which debauched the home , its deliberate interference with the States endeavoring to find honest solution , its permeation of political parties , its perversion of legislatures , which reached even to the Capital of the Nation . The 18th amendment smashed that regime as by a stroke of lightning . I cannot consent to the return of that system again . We must recognize the difficulties which have developed in making the 18th amendment effective and that grave abuses have grown up . In order to secure the enforcement of the amendment under our dual form of government , the constitutional provision called for concurrent action on one hand by the State and local authorities and on the other by the Federal Government . Its enforcement requires , therefore , independent but coincident action of both agencies . An increasing number of States and municipalities are proving themselves unwilling to engage in that enforcement . Due to these forces there is in large sections increasing illegal traffic in liquor . But worse than this there has been in those areas a spread of disrespect not only for this law but for all laws , grave dangers of practical nullification of the Constitution , an increase in subsidized crime and violence . I cannot consent to a continuation of that regime . I refuse to accept either of these destinies , on the one hand to return to the old saloon with its political and social corruption , or on the other to endure the bootlegger and the speakeasy with their abuses and crime . Either of them are intolerable , and they are not the only ways out . Now , our objective must be a sane solution , not a blind leap back to old evils . Moreover , a step backwards would result in a chaos of new evils not yet experienced , because the local systems of prohibition and controls which were developed over generations have been in a large degree abandoned under this amendment . The Republican platform recommends submission of the question to the States and that the people themselves may determine whether they desire a change , but insists that this submission shall propose a constructive and not a destructive change . It does not dictate to the conscience of any member of the party . The first duty of the President of the United States is to enforce the laws as they exist . That I shall continue to do to the best of my ability . Any other course would be the abrogation of the very guarantees of liberty itself . Now , the Constitution gives the President no power or authority with respect to changes in the Constitution itself nevertheless , my countrymen have a right to know my conclusions upon this question . They are based upon the broad facts that I have stated , upon my experience in this high office , and upon my deep conviction that our purpose must be the elimination of the evils of this traffic from this civilization by practical measures . It is my belief that in order to remedy present evils a change is necessary by which we resummon a proper share of initiative and responsibility which the very essence of our Government demands shall rest upon the States and the local authorities . That change must avoid the return of the saloon . It is my conviction that the nature of this change , and one upon which all reasonable people can find common ground , is that each State shall be given the right to deal with the problem as it may determine , but subject to the absolute guarantees in the Constitution of the United States to protect each State from interference and invasion by its neighbors , and that in no part of the United States shall there be a return of the saloon system with its inevitable political and social corruption and its organized interference with other States and other communities . American statesmanship is capable of working out such a solution and making it effective . My fellow citizens , the discussion of great problems of economic life and of government seem abstract and cold . But within their right solution lies the happiness and the hope of a great people . Without such solution all else is mere verbal sympathy . Today millions of our fellow countrymen are out of work . Prices of farmers products are below a living standard . Many millions more who are in business or hold employment are haunted by fears for the future . No man with a spark of humanity can sit in my place without suffering from the picture of their anxieties and hardships before him day and night . They would be more than human if they were not led to blame their condition upon the government in power . I have understood their sufferings and have worked to the limits of my strength to produce action that would be of help to them . Much remains to be done to attain recovery . We have had a great and unparalleled shock . The emergency measures now in action represent an unparalleled use of national power to relieve distress , to provide employment , to serve agriculture , to preserve the stability of the Government , and to maintain the integrity of our institutions . Our policies prevent unemployment caused by floods of imported goods and of laborers . Our policies preserve peace in the world . They embrace cooperation with other nations in those fields in which we can serve . With patience and perseverance these measures will succeed . Despite the dislocation of economic life our great tools of production and distribution are more efficient than ever before our fabulous national resources , our farms and homes and our skill are unimpaired . From the hard won experience of this depression we shall build stronger methods of prevention and stronger methods of protection to our people from abuses that have become evident . We shall march to a far greater accomplishment . With the united effort we can and will turn the tide towards the restoration of business , of employment , and of agriculture . It does call for the utmost devotion and the utmost wisdom . Every reserve of American courage and vision must be called upon to sustain us and to plan wisely for the future . Through it all our first duty is to preserve unfettered that dominant American spirit which has produced our enterprise and our individual character . That is the bedrock of the past , and it is the sole guarantee of the future . Not regimented mechanisms but free men are our goal . Herein is the fundamental issue . A representative democracy , progressive and unafraid to meet its problems , but meeting them upon the foundations of experience and not upon the wave of emotion or the insensate demands of a radicalism which grasps at every opportunity to exploit the sufferings of a people . With these courses we shall emerge from this great national strain with our American system of life and government strengthened . Our people will be free to reassert their energy and their enterprise in a society eager to reward in full measure those whose industry serves its well being . Our youth will find the doors of equal opportunity still open . The problems of the next few years are not only economic . They are also moral and spiritual . The present check to our material success must deeply stir our national conscience upon the purposes of life itself . It must cause us to revalue and reshape our drift from materialism to a higher note of individual and national ideals . Underlying every purpose is the spiritual application of moral ideals which are the fundamental basis of the happiness of a people . This is a land of homes and of churches and schoolhouses dedicated to the sober and enduring satisfactions of family life and the rearing of children in an atmosphere of ideals and of religious faith . Only with those ideals and those high standards can we hold society together , and only from them can government survive and business prosper . They are the sole insurance to the safety of our children and to the continuity of the Nation . If it shall appear that while I have had the honor of the Presidency that I have contributed to the part required from this high office to bringing the Republic through this dark night , and if in my administration we shall see the break of dawn of the better day , I shall have done my part in the world . No man can have a greater honor than that . I have but one desire that is , to see my country again on the road to prosperity which shall be more sane and lasting through the lessons of this experience , to see the principles and ideals of the American people perpetuated . I rest the case of the Republican Party upon the intelligence and the just discernment of the American people . Should my countrymen again place upon me the responsibilities of this high office , I shall carry forward the work of reconstruction . I shall hope long before another 4 years have passed to see the world prosperous and at peace and every American home again in the sunshine of genuine progress and of genuine prosperity . I shall seek to maintain untarnished and unweakened those fundamental traditions and principles upon which our Nation was rounded , upon which it has grown . I shall invite and welcome the help of every man and woman in the preservation of the United States for the happiness of its people . This is my pledge to the Nation and my pledge to the Almighty God .<speech_sep>IN APRIL 1928 , as a result of discussions between our Secretary of State of the United States and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France , the President directed Secretary Kellogg to propose to the nations of the world that they should enter into a binding agreement as follows Article 1 The high contracting parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies , and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another . Article 2 The high contracting parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be , which may arise among them , shall never be sought except by pacific means . That was a proposal to the conscience and idealism of civilized nations . It suggested a new step in international law , rich with meaning , pregnant with new ideas in the conduct of world relations . It represented a platform from which there is instant appeal to the public opinion of the world as to specific acts and deeds . The magnificent response of the world to these proposals is well indicated by those now signatory to its provisions . Under the terms of the treaty there have been deposited in Washington the ratifications of the 15 signatory nations that is , Australia , Belgium , Canada , Czechoslovakia , France , Germany , Great Britain , India , Irish Free State , Italy , Japan , New Zealand , Poland , Union of South Africa , and the United States of America . Beyond this the Treaty has today become effective also with respect to 31 other countries , the Governments of which have deposited with the Government of the United States instruments evidencing their definitive adherence to the Treaty . These countries are Afghanistan , Albania , Austria , Bulgaria , China , Cuba , Denmark , Dominican Republic , Egypt , Estonia , Ethiopia , Finland , Guatemala , Hungary , Iceland , Latvia , p . 234 Liberia , Lithuania , the Netherlands , Nicaragua , Norway , Panama , Portugal , Peru , Rumania , Russia , Kingdom of the Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , Siam , Spain , Sweden , and Turkey . Moreover , according to information received through diplomatic channels , the instruments of definitive adherence of Greece , Honduras , Persia , Switzerland , and Venezuela have been fully completed according to their constitutional methods and are now on the way to Washington for deposit . I congratulate this assembly , the states it represents , and indeed , the entire world upon the coming into force of this additional instrument of humane endeavor to do away with war as an instrument of national policy and to obtain by pacific means alone the settlement of international disputes . I am glad of this opportunity to pay merited tribute to the two statesmen whose names the world has properly adopted in its designation of this Treaty . To Aristide Briand , Minister of Foreign Affairs of France , we owe the inception of the Treaty and to his zeal is due a very large share of the success which attended the subsequent negotiations . To Frank Kellogg , then Secretary of State of the United States , we owe its expansion to the proportions of a treaty open to the entire world and destined , as I most confidently hope , shortly to include among its parties every country of the world . Stimson has sent forward today a message of felicitation to Briand and to the people of France for whom he speaks . I am happy , Kellogg , to extend to you , who represented the people of the United States with such untiring devotion and with such a high degree of diplomatic skill in the negotiations of this Treaty , their everlasting gratitude . We are honored here by the presence of President Coolidge under whose administration this great step in world peace was initiated . Under his authority and with his courageous support you , Kellogg , succeeded in this great service . And I wish to mark also the high appreciation in which we hold Senators Borah and Swanson for their leadership during its confirmation in the Senate . May I ask you who represent governments which have accepted this Treaty , now a part of their supreme law and their most sacred obligations , to convey to them the high appreciation of the Government of the United States that through their cordial collaboration an act so auspicious for the future happiness of mankind has now been consummated . I dare predict that the influence of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War will be felt in a large proportion of all future international acts . The magnificent opportunity and the compelling duty now open to us should spur us on to the fulfillment of every opportunity that is calculated to implement this Treaty and to extend the policy which it so nobly sets forth . I have today proclaimed the Treaty to the American people in language as follows Whereas a Treaty between the President of the United States of America , the President of the German Reich , His Majesty the King of the Belgians , the President of the French Republic , His Majesty the King of Great Britain , Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas , Emperor of India , His Majesty the King of Italy , His Majesty the Emperor of Japan , the President of the Republic of Poland , and the President of the Czechoslovak Republic , providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy and that the solution of disputes among Parties shall never be sought except by pacific means , was concluded and signed by their respective Plenipotentiaries at Paris on August twenty seven , 1928 , And whereas it is stipulated in the said Treaty that it shall take effect as between the High Contracting Parties as soon as all the several instruments of ratification shall have been deposited at Washington , And whereas the said Treaty has been duly ratified on the parts of all the High Contracting Parties and their several instruments of ratification have been deposited with the Government of the United States of America , the last on July twenty fourth , 1929 Now , therefore , be it known that Herbert Hoover , President of the United States of America , have caused the said Treaty to be made public to the end that the same and every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with good faith by the United States and the citizens thereof . In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed . Done in the city of Washington this twenty fourth day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty fourth .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives The Constitution requires that the President shall , from time to time , give to the Congress information of the state of the Union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . In complying with that requirement I wish to emphasize that during the past year the Nation has continued to grow in strength our people have advanced in comfort we have gained in knowledge the education of youth has been more widely spread moral and spiritual forces have been maintained peace has become more assured . The problems with which we are confronted are the problems of growth and of progress . In their solution we have to determine the facts , to develop the relative importance to be assigned to such facts , to formulate a common judgment upon them , and to realize solutions in spirit of conciliation . We are not only at peace with all the world , but the foundations for future peace are being substantially strengthened . To promote peace is our long established policy . Through the Kellogg Briand pact a great moral standard has been raised in the world . By it fifty four nations have covenanted to renounce war and to settle all disputes by pacific means . Through it a new world outlook has been inaugurated which has profoundly affected the foreign policies of nations . Since its inauguration we have initiated new efforts not only in the organization of the machinery of peace but also to eliminate dangerous forces which produce controversies amongst nations . In January , 1926 , the Senate gave its consent to adherence to the Court of International Justice with certain reservations . In September of this year the statute establishing the court has , by the action of the nations signatory , been amended to meet the Senate s reservations and to go even beyond those reservations to make clear that the court is a true international court of justice . I believe it will be clear to everyone that no controversy or question in which this country has or claims an interest can be passed on by the court without our consent at the time the question arises . The doubt about advisory opinions has been completely safeguarded . Our adherence to the International Court is , as now constituted , not the slightest step toward entry into the League of Nations . As I have before indicated , I shall direct that our signature be affixed to the protocol of adherence and shall submit it for the approval of the Senate with a special message at some time when it is convenient to deal with it . In the hope of reducing friction in the world , and with the desire that we may reduce the great economic burdens of naval armament , we have joined in conference with Great Britain , France , Italy , and Japan to be held in London in January to consider the further limitation and reduction of naval arms . We hold high hopes that success may attend this effort . At the beginning of the present administration the neighboring State of Mexico was best with domestic insurrection . We maintained the embargo upon the shipment of arms to Mexico but permitted the duly constituted Government to procure supplies from our surplus war stocks . Fortunately , the Mexican Government by its own strength successfully withstood the insurrection with but slight damage . Opportunity of further peaceful development is given to that country . At the request of the Mexican Government , we have since lifted the embargo on shipment of arms altogether . The two governments have taken further steps to promote friendly relationships and so solve our differences . Conventions prolonging for a period of two years the life of the general and special claims commissions have been concluded . In South America we are proud to have had part in the settlement of the long standing dispute between Chile and Peru in the disposal of the question of Tacna Arica . The work of the commission of inquiry and conciliation between Bolivia and Paraguay , in which a representative of this Government participated , has successfully terminated an incident which seemed to threaten war . The proposed plan for final settlement as suggested by the neutral governments is still under consideration . This Government has continued its efforts to act as a mediator in boundary difficulties between Guatemala and Honduras . A further instance of profound importance in establishing good will was the inauguration of regular air mail service between the United States and Caribbean , Central American , and South American countries . We still have marines on foreign soil in Nicaragua , Haiti , and China . In the large sense we do not wish to be represented abroad in such manner . About 1 , 600 marines remain in Nicaragua at the urgent request of that government and the leaders of all parties pending the training of a domestic constabulary capable of insuring tranquility . We have already reduced these forces materially and we are anxious to withdraw them further as the situation warrants . In Haiti we have about 700 marines , but it is a much more difficult problem , the solution of which is still obscure . If Congress approves , I shall dispatch a commission to Haiti to review and study the matter in an endeavor to arrive at some more definite policy than at present . Our forces in China constitute 2 , 605 men , which we hope also further to reduce to the normal legation guard . It is my desire to establish more firmly our understanding and relationships with the Latin American countries by strengthening the diplomatic missions to those countries . It is my hope to secure men long experienced in our Diplomatic Service , who speak the languages of the peoples to whom they are accredited , as chiefs of our diplomatic missions in these States . I shall send to the Senate at an early date the nominations of several such men . The Congress has by numerous wise and foresighted acts in the past few years greatly strengthened the character of our representation abroad . It has made liberal provision for the establishment of suitable quarters for our foreign staffs in the different countries . In order , however , that we may further develop the most effective force in this , one of the most responsible functions of our Government , I shall recommend to the Congress more liberal appropriations for the work of the State Department . I know of no expenditure of public money from which a greater economic and moral return can come to us than by assuring the most effective conduct of our foreign relations . To preserve internal order and freedom from encroachment is the first purpose of government . Our Army and Navy are being maintained in a most efficient state under officers of high intelligence and zeal . The extent and expansion of their numbers and equipment as at present authorized are ample for this purpose . We can well be deeply concerned , however , at the growing expense . From a total expenditure for national defense purposes in 1914 of 267 , 000 , 000 , it naturally rose with the Great War , but receded again to 612 , 000 , 000 in 1924 , when again it began to rise until during the current fiscal year the expenditures will reach to over 730 , 000 , 000 , excluding all civilian services of those departments . Programs now authorized will carry it to still larger figures in future years . While the remuneration paid to our soldiers and sailors is justly at a higher rate than that of any other country in the world , and while the cost of subsistence is higher , yet the total of our expenditures is in excess of those of the most highly militarized nations of the world . Upon the conference shortly to be held in London will depend such moderation as we can make in naval expenditure . If we shall be compelled to undertake the naval construction implied in the Washington arms treaty as well as other construction which would appear to be necessary if no international agreement can be completed , we shall be committed during the next six years to a construction expenditure of upward of 1 , 200 , 000 , 000 besides the necessary further increase in costs for annual upkeep . After 1914 the various Army contingents necessarily expanded to the end of the Great War and then receded to the low point in 1924 , when expansion again began . In 1914 the officers and men in our regular forces , both Army and Navy , were about 164 , 000 , in 1924 there were about 256 , 000 , and in 1929 there were about 250 , 000 . Our citizens army , however , including the National Guard and other forms of reserves , increase these totals up to about 299 , 000 in 1914 , about 672 , 000 in 1924 , and about 728 , 000 in 1929 . Under the Kellogg pact we have undertaken never to use war as an instrument of national policy . We have , therefore , undertaken by covenant to use these equipments solely for defensive purposes . From a defense point of view our forces should be proportioned to national need and should , therefore , to some extent be modified by the prospects of peace , which were never brighter than to day . It should be borne in mind that the improvement in the National Guard by Federal support begun in 1920 has definitely strengthened our national security by rendering them far more effective than ever heretofore . The advance of aviation has also greatly increased our effectiveness in defense . In addition to the very large program of air forces which we are maintaining in the Army and Navy , there has been an enormous growth of commercial aviation . This has provided unanticipated reserves in manufacturing capacity and in industrial and air personnel , which again adds to our security . I recommend that Congress give earnest consideration to the possibilities of prudent action which will give relief from our continuously mounting expenditures . The finances of the Government are in sound condition . I shall submit the detailed evidences and the usual recommendations in the special Budget message . I may , however , summarize our position . The public debt on June 30 this year stood at 16 , 931 , 000 , 000 , compared to the maximum in August , 1919 , of 26 , 596 , 000 , 000 . Since June 30 it has been reduced by a further 238 , 000 , 000 . In the Budget to be submitted the total appropriations recommended for the fiscal year 1931 are 3 , 830 , 445 , 231 , as compared to 3 , 976 , 141 , 651 for the present fiscal year . The present fiscal year , however , includes 150 , 000 , 000 for the Federal Farm Board , as to which no estimate can as yet be determined for 1931 . Owing to the many necessary burdens assumed by Congress in previous years which now require large outlays , it is with extreme difficulty that we shall be able to keep the expenditures for the next fiscal year within the bounds of the present year . Economies in many directions have permitted some accommodation of pressing needs , the net result being an increase , as shown above , of about one tenth of 1 per cent above the present fiscal year . We can not fail to recognize the obligations of the Government in support of the public welfare but we must coincidentally bear in mind the burden of taxes and strive to find relief through some tax reduction . Every dollar so returned fertilizes the soil of prosperity . The estimate submitted to me by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Budget Director indicates that the Government will close the fiscal year 1930 with a surplus of about 225 , 000 , 000 and the fiscal year 1931 with a surplus of about 123 , 000 , 000 . Owing to unusual circumstances , it has been extremely difficult to estimate future revenues with accuracy . I believe , however , that the Congress will be fully justified in giving the benefits of the prospective surpluses to the taxpayers , particularly as ample provision for debt reduction has been made in both years through the form of debt retirement from ordinary revenues . In view of the uncertainty in respect of future revenues and the comparatively small size of the indicated surplus in 1931 , relief should take the form of a provisional revision of tax rates . I recommend that the normal income tax rates applicable to the incomes of individuals for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 5 , 3 , and 1 frac12 per cent , to 4 , 2 , and frac12 per cent , and that the tax on the income of corporations for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 12 to 11 per cent . It is estimated that this will result in a reduction of 160 , 000 , 000 in income taxes to be collected during the calendar year 1930 . The loss in revenue will be divided approximately equally between the fiscal years 1930 and 1931 . Such a program will give a measure of tax relief to the maximum number of taxpayers , with relatively larger benefits to taxpayers with small or moderate incomes . The past year has brought us near to completion of settlements of the indebtedness of foreign governments to the United States . The act of Congress approved February 4 , 1929 , authorized the settlement with the Government of Austria along lines similar to the terms of settlement offered by that Government to its other relief creditors . No agreement has yet been concluded with that government , but the form of agreement has been settled and its execution only awaits the Government of Austria securing the assent by all the other relief creditors of the terms offered . The act of Congress approved February 14 , 1929 , authorized the settlement with the Government of Greece , and an agreement was concluded on May 10 , 1929 . The Government of France ratified the agreement with us on July 27 , 1929 . This agreement will shortly be before the Congress and I recommend its approval . The only indebtedness of foreign governments to the United States now unsettled is that of Russia and Armenia . During the past year a committee of distinguished experts under American leadership submitted a plan looking to a revision of claims against Germany by the various Governments . The United States denied itself any participation in the war settlement of general reparations and our claims are comparatively small in amount . They arise from costs of the army of occupation and claims of our private citizens for losses under awards from the Mixed Claims Commission established under agreement with the German Government . In finding a basis for settlement it was necessary for the committee of experts to request all the Governments concerned to make some contribution to the adjustment and we have felt that we should share a proportion of the concessions made . The State and Treasury Departments will be in a position shortly to submit for your consideration a draft of an agreement to be executed between the United States and Germany providing for the payments of these revised amounts . A more extensive statement will be submitted at that time . The total amount of indebtedness of the various countries to the United States now funded is 11 , 579 , 465 , 885 . This sum was in effect provided by the issue of United States Government bonds to our own people . The payments of the various Governments to us on account of principal and interest for 1930 are estimated at a total of about 239 , 000 , 000 , for 1931 at about 236 , 000 , 000 , for 1932 at about 246 , 000 , 000 . The measure of American compromise in these settlements may be appreciated from the fact that our taxpayers are called upon to find annually about 475 , 000 , 000 in interest and in addition to redeem the principal of sums borrowed by the United States Government for these purposes . The wise determination that this property seized in war should be returned to its owners has proceeded with considerable rapidity . Of the original seized cash and property valued at a total of about 625 , 000 , 000 , all but 111 , 566 , 700 has been returned . Most of the remainder should be disposed of during the next year . The country has enjoyed a large degree of prosperity and sound progress during the past year with a steady improvement in methods of production and distribution and consequent advancement in standards of living . Progress has , of course , been unequal among industries , and some , such as coal , lumber , leather , and textiles , still lag behind . The long upward trend of fundamental progress , however , gave rise to over optimism as to profits , which translated itself into a wave of uncontrolled speculation in securities , resulting in the diversion of capital from business to the stock market and the inevitable crash . The natural consequences have been a reduction in the consumption of luxuries and semi necessities by those who have met with losses , and a number of persons thrown temporarily out of employment . Prices of agricultural products dealt in upon the great markets have been affected in sympathy with the stock crash . Fortunately , the Federal reserve system had taken measures to strengthen the position against the day when speculation would break , which together with the strong position of the banks has carried the whole credit system through the crisis without impairment . The capital which has been hitherto absorbed in stock market loans for speculative purposes is now returning to the normal channels of business . There has been no inflation in the prices of commodities there has been no undue accumulation of goods , and foreign trade has expanded to a magnitude which exerts a steadying influence upon activity in industry and employment . The sudden threat of unemployment and especially the recollection of the economic consequences of previous crashes under a much less secured financial system created unwarranted pessimism and fear . It was recalled that past storms of similar character had resulted in retrenchment of construction , reduction of wages , and laying off of workers . The natural result was the tendency of business agencies throughout the country to pause in their plans and proposals for continuation and extension of their businesses , and this hesitation unchecked could in itself intensify into a depression with widespread unemployment and suffering . I have , therefore , instituted systematic , voluntary measures of cooperation with the business institutions and with State and municipal authorities to make certain that fundamental businesses of the country shall continue as usual , that wages and therefore consuming power shall not be reduced , and that a special effort shall be made to expand construction work in order to assist in equalizing other deficits in employment . Due to the enlarged sense of cooperation and responsibility which has grown in the business world during the past few years the response has been remarkable and satisfactory . We have canvassed the Federal Government and instituted measures of prudent expansion in such work that should be helpful , and upon which the different departments will make some early recommendations to Congress . I am convinced that through these measures we have reestablished confidence . Wages should remain stable . A very large degree of industrial unemployment and suffering which would otherwise have occurred has been prevented . Agricultural prices have reflected the returning confidence . The measures taken must be vigorously pursued until normal conditions are restored . The agricultural situation is improving . The gross farm income as estimated by the Department of Agriculture for the crop season 1926 27 was 12 , 100 , 000 , 000 for 1927 28 it was 12 , 300 , 000 , 000 for 1928 29 it was 12 , 500 , 000 , 000 and estimated on the basis of prices since the last harvest the value of the 1929 30 crop would be over 12 , 650 , 000 , 000 . The slight decline in general commodity prices during the past few years naturally assists the farmers buying power . The number of farmer bankruptcies is very materially decreased below previous years . The decline in land values now seems to be arrested and rate of movement from the farm to the city has been reduced . Not all sections of agriculture , of course , have fared equally , and some areas have suffered from drought . Responsible farm leaders have assured me that a large measure of confidence is returning to agriculture and that a feeling of optimism pervades that industry . The most extensive action for strengthening the agricultural industry ever taken by any government was inaugurated through the farm marketing act of June 15 last . Under its provisions the Federal Farm Board has been established , comprised of men long and widely experienced in agriculture and sponsored by the farm organizations of the country . During its short period of existence the board has taken definite steps toward a more efficient organization of agriculture , toward the elimination of waste in marketing , and toward the upbuilding of farmers marketing organizations on sounder and more efficient lines . Substantial headway has been made in the organization of four of the basic commodities grain , cotton , livestock , and wool . Support by the board to cooperative marketing organizations and other board activities undoubtedly have served to steady the farmers market during the recent crisis and have operated also as a great stimulus to the cooperative organization of agriculture . The problems of the industry are most complex , and the need for sound organization is imperative . Yet the board is moving rapidly along the lines laid out for it in the act , facilitating the creation by farmers of farmer owned and farmer controlled organizations and federating them into central institutions , with a view to increasing the bargaining power of agriculture , preventing and controlling surpluses , and mobilizing the economic power of agriculture . The special session of Congress was called to expedite the fulfillment of party pledges of agricultural relief and the tariff . The pledge of farm relief has been carried out . At that time I stated the principles upon which I believed action should be taken in respect to the tariff An effective tariff upon agricultural products , that will compensate the farmer s higher costs and higher standards of living , has a dual purpose . Such a tariff not only protects the farmer in our domestic market but it also stimulates him to diversify his crops and to grow products that he could not otherwise produce , and thus lessens his dependence upon exports to foreign markets . The great expansion of production abroad under the conditions I have mentioned renders foreign competition in our export markets increasingly serious . It seems but natural , therefore , that the American farmer , having been greatly handicapped in his foreign market by such competition from the younger expanding countries , should ask that foreign access to our domestic market should be regulated by taking into account the differences in our costs of production . In considering the tariff for other industries than agriculture , we find that there have been economic shifts necessitating a readjustment of some of the tariff schedules . Seven years of experience under the tariff bill enacted in 1922 have demonstrated the wisdom of Congress in the enactment of that measure . On the whole it has worked well . In the main our wages have been maintained at high levels our exports and imports have steadily increased with some exceptions our manufacturing industries have been prosperous . Nevertheless , economic changes have taken place during that time which have placed certain domestic products at a disadvantage and new industries have come into being , all of which create the necessity for some limited changes in the schedules and in the administrative clauses of the laws as written in 1922 . It would seem to me that the test of necessity for revision is , in the main , whether there has been a substantial slackening of activity in an industry during the past few years , and a consequent decrease of employment due to insurmountable competition in the products of that industry . It is not as if we were setting up a new basis of protective duties . We did that seven years ago . What we need to remedy now is whatever substantial loss of employment may have resulted from shifts since that time . In determining changes in our tariff we must not fail to take into account the broad interests of the country as a whole , and such interests include our trade relations with other countries . No condition has arisen in my view to change these principles stated at the opening of the special session . I am firmly of the opinion that their application to the pending revision will give the country the kind of a tariff law it both needs and wants . It would be most helpful if action should be taken at an early moment , more especially at a time when business and agriculture are both cooperating to minimize future uncertainties . It is just that they should know what the rates are to be . Even a limited revision requires the consideration and readjustment of many items . The exhaustive inquiries and valuable debate from men representative of all parts of the country which is needed to determine the detailed rates must necessarily be accomplished in the Congress . However perfectly this rate structure may be framed at any given time , the shifting of economic forces which inevitably occurs will render changes in some items desirable between the necessarily long intervals of congressional revision . Injustices are bound to develop , such as were experienced by the dairymen , the flaxseed producers , the glass industry , and others , under the 1922 rates . For this reason , I have been most anxious that the broad principle of the flexible tariff as provided in the existing law should be preserved and its delays in action avoided by more expeditious methods of determining the costs of production at home and abroad , with executive authority to promulgate such changes upon recommendation of the Tariff Commission after exhaustive investigation . Changes by the Congress in the isolated items such as those to which I have referred would have been most unlikely both because of the concentrations of oppositions in the country , who could see no advantage to their own industry or State , and because of the difficulty of limiting consideration by the Congress to such isolated cases . There is no fundamental conflict between the interests of the farmer and the worker . Lowering of the standards of living of either tends to destroy the other . The prosperity of one rests upon the well being of the other . Nor is there any real conflict between the East and the West or the North and the South in the United States . The complete interlocking of economic dependence , the common striving for social and spiritual progress , our common heritage as Americans , and the infinite web of national sentiment , have created a solidarity in a great people unparalleled in all human history . These invisible bonds should not and can not be shattered by differences of opinion growing out of discussion of a tariff . Under the provisions of various acts of Congress 300 , 000 , 000 has been authorized for public buildings and the land upon which to construct them , being 75 , 000 , 000 for the District of Columbia and 225 , 000 , 000 for the country at large . Excluding 25 , 000 , 000 which is for the acquisition of land in the so called triangle in this city , this public building legislation provides for a five year program for the District of Columbia and between an eight and nine year program for the country at large . Of this sum approximately 27 , 400 , 000 was expended up to June 30 last , of which 11 , 400 , 000 has been expended in the District and 16 , 000 , 000 outside . Even this generous provision for both the District of Columbia and the country is insufficient For most pressing governmental needs . Expensive rents and inadequate facilities are extravagance and not economy . In the District even after the completion of these projects we shall have fully 20 , 000 clerks housed in rented and temporary war buildings which can last but a little longer . I therefore recommend that consideration should be given to the extension of authorizations both for the country at large and for the District of Columbia again distributed over a term of years . A survey of the need in both categories has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Postmaster General . It would be helpful in the present economic situation if such steps were taken as would enable early construction work . An expedition and enlargement of the program in the District would bring about direct economies in construction by enabling the erection of buildings in regular sequence . By maintaining a stable labor force in the city , contracts can be made on more advantageous terms . The earlier completion of this program which is an acknowledged need would add dignity to the celebration in 1932 of the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of President Washington . In consideration of these projects which contribute so much to dignify the National Capital I should like to renew the suggestion that the Fine Arts Commission should be required to pass upon private buildings which are proposed for sites facing upon public buildings and parks . Without such control much of the effort of the Congress in beautification of the Capital will be minimized . The development of inland waterways has received new impulse from the completion during this year of the canalization of the Ohio to a uniform 9 foot depth . The development of the other segments of the Mississippi system should be expedited and with this in view I am recommending an increase in appropriations for rivers and harbors from 50 , 000 , 000 to 55 , 000 , 000 per annum which , together with about 4 , 000 , 000 per annum released by completion of the Ohio , should make available after providing for other river and harbor works a sum of from 25 , 000 , 000 to 30 , 000 , 000 per annum for the Mississippi system and thus bring it to early completion . Conflict of opinion which has arisen over the proposed floodway from the Arkansas River to the Gulf of Mexico via the Atchafalaya River has led me to withhold construction upon this portion of the Mississippi flood control plan until it could be again reviewed by the engineers for any further recommendation to Congress . The other portions of the project are being vigorously prosecuted and I have recommended an increase in appropriations for this from 30 , 000 , 000 of the present year to 35 , 000 , 000 during the next fiscal year . Expansion of our intracoastal waterways to effective barge depths is well warranted . We are awaiting the action of Canada upon the Lawrence waterway project . There are over 3 , 000 , 000 miles of legally established highways in the United States , of which about 10 per cent are included in the State highway systems , the remainder being county and other local roads . About 626 , 000 miles have been improved with some type of surfacing , comprising some 63 per cent of the State highway systems and 16 per cent of the local roads . Of the improved roads about 102 , 000 miles are hard surfaced , comprising about 22 per cent of the State highway systems and about 8 per cent of the local roads . While proper planning should materially reduce the listed mileage of public roads , particularly in the agricultural districts , and turn these roads back to useful purposes , it is evident that road construction must be a long continued program . Progress in improvement is about 50 , 000 miles of all types per annum , of which some 12 , 000 miles are of the more durable types . The total expenditures of Federal , State , and local governments last year for construction and maintenance assumed the huge total of 1 , 660 , 000 , 000 . Federal aid in the construction of the highway systems in conjunction with the States has proved to be beneficial and stimulating . We must ultimately give consideration to the increase of our contribution to these systems , particularly with a view to stimulating the improvement of farm to market roads . Our Post Office deficit has now increased to over 80 , 000 , 000 a year , of which perhaps 14 , 000 , 000 is due to losses on ocean mail and air mail contracts . The department is making an exhaustive study of the sources of the deficit with view to later recommendation to Congress in respect to it . The Post Office quarters are provided in part by the Federal construction , in part by various forms of rent and lease arrangements . The practice has grown up in recent years of contracting long term leases under which both rent and amortization principal cost of buildings is included . I am advised that fully 40 per cent could be saved from many such rent and lease agreements even after allowing interest on the capital required at the normal Government rate . There are also many objectionable features to some of these practices . The provision of adequate quarters for the Post Office should be put on a sound basis . A revision of air mail rates upon a more systematic and permanent footing is necessary . The subject is under study , and if legislation should prove necessary the subject will be presented to the Congress . In the meantime I recommend that the Congress should consider the desirability of authorizing further expansion of the South American services . During the past year progress in civil aeronautics has been remarkable . This is to a considerable degree due to the wise assistance of the Federal Government through the establishment and maintenance of airways by the Department of Commerce and the mail contracts from the Post Office Department . The Government improved airways now exceed 25 , 000 miles more than 14 , 000 miles of which will be lighted and equipped for night flying operations by the close of the current year . Airport construction through all the States is extremely active . There are now 1 , 000 commercial and municipal airports in operation with an additional 1 , 200 proposed for early development . Through this assistance the Nation is building a sound aviation system , operated by private enterprise . Over 6 , 400 planes are in commercial use , and 9 , 400 pilots are licensed by the Government . Our manufacturing capacity has risen to 7 , 500 planes per annum . The aviation companies have increased regular air transportation until it now totals 90 , 000 miles per day one fourth of which is flown by night . Mail and express services now connect our principal cities , and extensive services for passenger transportation have been inaugurated , and others of importance are imminent . American air lines now reach into Canada and Mexico , to Cuba , Porto Rico , Central America , and most of the important countries of South America . As a whole , the railroads never were in such good physical and financial condition , and the country has never been so well served by them . The greatest volume of freight traffic ever tendered is being carried at a speed never before attained and with satisfaction to the shippers . Efficiencies and new methods have resulted in reduction in the cost of providing freight transportation , and freight rates show a continuous descending line from the level enforced by the World War . We have , however , not yet assured for the future that adequate system of transportation through consolidations which was the objective of the Congress in the transportation act . The chief purpose of consolidation is to secure well balanced systems with more uniform and satisfactory rate structure , a more stable financial structure , more equitable distribution of traffic , greater efficiency , and single line instead of multiple line hauls . In this way the country will have the assurance of better service and ultimately at lower and more even rates than would otherwise be attained . Legislation to simplify and expedite consolidation methods and better to protect public interest should be enacted . Consideration should also be given to relief of the members of the Commission from the necessity of detailed attention to comparatively inconsequential matters which , under the existing law , must receive their direct and personal consideration . It is in the public interest that the members of the Commission should not be so pressed by minor matters that they have inadequate time for investigation and consideration of the larger questions committed to them for solution . As to many of these minor matters , the function of the Commission might well be made revisory , and the primary responsibility delegated to subordinate officials after the practice long in vogue in the executive departments . Under the impulse of the merchant marine act of 1928 the transfer to private enterprise of the Government owned steamship lines is going forward with increasing success . The Shipping Board now operates about 18 lines , which is less than half the number originally established , and the estimate of expenditures for the coming fiscal year is based upon reduction in losses on Government lines by approximately one half . Construction loans have been made to the amount of approximately 75 , 000 , 000 out of the revolving fund authorized by Congress and have furnished an additional aid to American shipping and further stimulated the building of vessels in American yards . Desirous of securing the full values to the Nation of the great effort to develop our merchant marine by the merchant marine act soon after the inauguration of the present administration , I appointed an interdepartmental committee , consisting of the Secretary of Commerce , as chairman , the Secretary of the Navy , the Postmaster General , and the chairman of the Shipping Board , to make a survey of the policies being pursued under the act of 1928 in respect of mail contracts to inquire into its workings and to advise the Postmaster General in the administration of the act . In particular it seemed to me necessary to determine if the result of the contracts already let would assure the purpose expressed in the act , to further develop an American merchant marine , to assure its permanence in the transportation of the foreign trade of the United States , and for other purposes , and to develop a coordinated policy by which these purposes may be translated into actualities . In review of the mail contracts already awarded it was found that they aggregated 25 separate awards imposing a governmental obligation of a little over 12 , 000 , 000 per annum . Provision had been imposed in five of the contracts for construction of new vessels with which to replace and expand services . These requirements come to a total of 12 vessels in the 10 year period , aggregating 122 , 000 tons . Some other conditions in the contracts had not worked out satisfactorily . That study has now been substantially completed and the committee has advised the desirability and the necessity of securing much larger undertakings as to service and new construction in future contracts . The committee at this time is recommending the advertising of 14 additional routes , making substantial requirements for the construction of new vessels during the life of each contract recommended . A total of 40 new vessels will be required under the contracts proposed , about half of which will be required to be built during the next three years . The capital cost of this new construction will be approximately 250 , 000 , 000 , involving approximately 460 , 000 gross tons . Should bidders be found who will make these undertakings , it will be necessary to recommend to Congress an increase in the authorized expenditure by the Post Office of about 5 , 500 , 000 annually . It will be most advantageous to grant such an authority . A conflict as to the administration of the act has arisen in the contention of persons who have purchased Shipping Board vessels that they are entitled to mail contracts irrespective of whether they are the lowest bidder , the Post Office , on the other hand , being required by law to let contracts in that manner . It is urgent that Congress should clarify this situation . It is desirable that Congress should consider the revision of some portions of the banking law . The development of group and chain banking presents many new problems . The question naturally arises as to whether if allowed to expand without restraint these methods would dangerously concentrate control of credit , and whether they would not in any event seriously threaten one of the fundamentals of the American credit system which is that credit which is based upon banking deposits should be controlled by persons within those areas which furnish these deposits and thus be subject to the restraints of local interest and public opinion in those areas . To some degree , however , this movement of chain or group banking is a groping for stronger support to the banks and a more secure basis for these institutions . The growth in size and stability of the metropolitan banks is in marked contrast to the trend in the country districts , with its many failures and the losses these failures have imposed upon the agricultural community . The relinquishment of charters of national banks in great commercial centers in favor of State charters indicates that some conditions surround the national banks which render them unable to compete with State banks and their withdrawal results in weakening our national banking system . It has been proposed that permission should be granted to national banks to engage in branch banking of a nature that would preserve within limited regions the local responsibility and the control of such credit institutions . All these subjects , however , require careful investigation , and it might be found advantageous to create a joint commission embracing Members of the Congress and other appropriate Federal officials for subsequent report . The Federal Power Commission is now comprised of three Cabinet officers , and the duties involved in the competent conduct of the growing responsibilities of this commission far exceed the time and attention which these officials can properly afford from other important duties . I recommended that authority be given for the appointment of full time commissioners to replace them . It is also desirable that the authority of the commission should be extended to certain phases of power regulation . The nature of the electric utilities industry is such that about 90 per cent of all power generation and distribution is intrastate in character , and most of the States have developed their own regulatory systems as to certificates of convenience , rates , and profits of such utilities . To encroach upon their authorities and responsibilities would be an encroachment upon the rights of the States . There are cases , however , of interstate character beyond the jurisdiction of the States . To meet these cases it would be most desirable if a method could be worked out by which initial action may be taken between the commissions of the States whose joint action should be made effective by the Federal Power Commission with a reserve to act on its own motion in case of disagreement or nonaction by the States . I recommend the reorganization of the Radio Commission into a permanent body from its present temporary status . The requirement of the present law that the commissioners shall be appointed from specified zones should be abolished and a general provision made for their equitable selection from different parts of the country . Despite the effort of the commissioners , the present method develops a public insistence that the commissioners are specially charged with supervision of radio affairs in the zone from which each is appointed . As a result there is danger that the system will degenerate from a national system into five regional agencies with varying practices , varying policies , competitive tendencies , and consequent failure to attain its utmost capacity for service to the people as a whole . It is most desirable that this question should be disposed of . Under present conditions the income from these plants is less than could otherwise be secured for its use , and more especially the public is not securing the full benefits which could be obtained from them . It is my belief that such parts of these plants as would be useful and the revenues from the remainder should be dedicated for all time to the farmers of the United States for investigation and experimentation on a commercial scale in agricultural chemistry . By such means advancing discoveries of science can be systematically applied to agricultural need , and development of the chemical industry of the Tennessee Valley can be assured . I do not favor the operation by the Government of either power or manufacturing business except as an unavoidable by product of some other major public purpose . Any form of settlement of this question will imply entering upon a contract or contracts for the lease of the plants either as a whole or in parts and the reservation of facilities , products , or income for agricultural purposes . The extremely technical and involved nature of such contracts dealing with chemical and electrical enterprises , added to the unusual difficulties surrounding these special plants , and the rapid commercial changes now in progress in power and synthetic nitrogen manufacture , lead me to suggest that Congress create a special commission , not to investigate and report as in the past , but with authority to negotiate and complete some sort of contract or contracts on behalf of the Government , subject , of course , to such general requirements as Congress may stipulate . The Secretary of the Interior is making satisfactory progress in negotiation of the very complex contracts required for the sale of the power to be generated at this project . These contracts must assure the return of all Government outlays upon the project . I recommend that the necessary funds be appropriated for the initiation of this work as soon as the contracts are in the hands of Congress . Conservation of national resources is a fixed policy of the Government . Three important questions bearing upon conservation of the public lands have become urgent . Conservation of our oil and gas resources against future need is a national necessity . The working of the oil permit system in development of oil and gas resources on the public domain has been subject to great abuse . I considered it necessary to suspend the issuance of such permits and to direct the review of all outstanding permits as to compliance of the holders with the law . The purpose was not only to end such abuse but to place the Government in position to review the entire subject . We are also confronted with a major problem in conservation due to the overgrazing on public lands . The effect of overgrazing which has now become general is not only to destroy the ranges but by impairing the ground coverage seriously to menace the water supply in many parts of the West through quick run off , spring floods , and autumn drought . We have a third problem of major dimensions in the reconsideration of our reclamation policy . The inclusion of most of the available lands of the public domain in existing or planned reclamation projects largely completes the original purpose of the Reclamation Service . There still remains the necessity for extensive storage of water in the arid States which renders it desirable that we should give a wider vision and purpose to this service . To provide for careful consideration of these questions and also of better division of responsibilities in them as between the State and Federal Governments , including the possible transfer to the States for school purposes of the lands unreserved for forests , parks , power , minerals , etc . , I have appointed a Commission on Conservation of the Public Domain , with a membership representing the major public land States and at the same time the public at large . I recommend that Congress should authorize a moderate sum to defray their expenses . The Federal Government provides for an extensive and valuable program of constructive social service , in education , home building , protection to women and children , employment , public health , recreation , and many other directions . In a broad sense Federal activity in these directions has been confined to research and dissemination of information and experience , and at most to temporary subsidies to the States in order to secure uniform advancement in practice and methods . Any other attitude by the Federal Government will undermine one of the most precious possessions of the American people that is , local and individual responsibility . We should adhere to this policy . Federal officials can , however , make a further and most important contribution by leadership in stimulation of the community and voluntary agencies , and by extending Federal assistance in organization of these forces and bringing about cooperation among them . As an instance of this character , I have recently , in cooperation with the Secretaries of Interior and Labor , laid the foundations of an exhaustive inquiry into the facts precedent to a nation wide White House conference on child health and protection . This cooperative movement among interested agencies will impose no expense upon the Government . Similar nation wide conferences will be called in connection with better housing and recreation at a later date . In view of the considerable difference of opinion as to the policies which should be pursued by the Federal Government with respect to education , I have appointed a committee representative of the important educational associations and others to investigate and present recommendations . In cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior , I have also appointed a voluntary committee of distinguished membership to assist in a nation wide movement for abolition of illiteracy . I have recommended additional appropriations for the Federal employment service in order that it may more fully cover its cooperative work with State and local services . I have also recommended additional appropriations for the Women s and Children s Bureaus for much needed research as to facts which I feel will prove most helpful . The advance in scientific discovery as to disease and health imposes new considerations upon us . . The Nation as a whole is vitally interested in the health of all the people in protection from spread of contagious disease in the relation of physical and mental disabilities to criminality and in the economic and moral advancement which is fundamentally associated with sound body and mind . The organization of preventive measures and health education in its personal application is the province of public health service . Such organization should be as universal as public education . Its support is a proper burden upon the taxpayer . It can not be organized with success , either in its sanitary or educational phases , except under public authority . It should be based upon local and State responsibility , but I consider that the Federal Government has an obligation of contribution to the establishment of such agencies . In the practical working out of organization , exhaustive experiment and trial have demonstrated that the base should be competent organization of the municipality , county , or other local unit . Most of our municipalities and some 400 rural counties out of 3 , 000 now have some such unit organization . Where highly developed , a health unit comprises at least a physician , sanitary engineer , and community nurse with the addition , in some cases , of another nurse devoted to the problems of maternity and children . Such organization gives at once a fundamental control of preventive measures and assists in community instruction . The Federal Government , through its interest in control of contagion , acting through the United States Public Health Service and the State agencies , has in the past and should in the future concern itself with this development , particularly in the many rural sections which are unfortunately far behind in progress . Some parts of the funds contributed under the Sheppard Towner Act through the Children s Bureau of the Department of Labor have also found their way into these channels . I recommend to the Congress that the purpose of the Sheppard Towner Act should be continued through the Children s Bureau for a limited period of years and that the Congress should consider the desirability of confining the use of Federal funds by the States to the building up of such county or other local units , and that such outlay should be positively coordinated with the funds expended through the United States Public Health Service directed to other phases of the same county or other local unit organization . All funds appropriated should of course be applied through the States , so that the public health program of the county or local unit will be efficiently coordinated with that of the whole State . Closely related to crime conditions is the administration of the Federal prison system . Our Federal penal institutions are overcrowded , and this condition is daily becoming worse . The parole and probation systems are inadequate . These conditions make it impossible to perform the work of personal reconstruction of prisoners so as to prepare them for return to the duties of citizenship . In order to relieve the pressing evils I have directed the temporary transfer of the Army Disciplinary Barracks at Leavenworth to the Department of Justice for use as a Federal prison . Not only is this temporary but it is inadequate for present needs . We need some new Federal prisons and a reorganization of our probation and parole systems and there should be established in the Department of Justice a Bureau of Prisons with a sufficient force to deal adequately with the growing activities of our prison institutions . Authorization for the improvements should be given speedily , with initial appropriations to allow the construction of the new institutions to be undertaken at once . Restriction of immigration has from every aspect proved a sound national policy . Our pressing problem is to formulate a method by which the limited number of immigrants whom we do welcome shall be adapted to our national setting and our national needs . I have been opposed to the basis of the quotas now in force and I have hoped that we could find some practical method to secure what I believe should be our real national objective that is , fitness of the immigrant as to physique , character , training , and our need of service . Perhaps some system of priorities within the quotas could produce these results and at the same time enable some hardships in the present system to be cleared up . I recommend that the Congress should give the subject further study , in which the executive departments will gladly cooperate with the hope of discovering such method as will more fully secure our national necessities . It has been the policy of our Government almost from its inception to make provision for the men who have been disabled in defense of our country . This policy should be maintained . Originally it took the form of land grants and pensions . This system continued until our entry into the World War . The Congress at that time inaugurated a new plan of compensation , rehabilitation , hospitalization , medical care and treatment , and insurance , whereby benefits were awarded to those veterans and their immediate dependents whose disabilities were attributable to their war service . The basic principle in this legislation is sound . In a desire to eliminate all possibilities of injustice due to difficulties in establishing service connection of disabilities , these principles have been to some degree extended . Veterans whose diseases or injuries have become apparent within a brief period after the war are now receiving compensation insurance benefits have been liberalized . Emergency officers are now receiving additional benefits . The doors of the Government s hospitals have been opened to all veterans , even though their diseases or injuries were not the result of their war service . In addition adjusted service certificates have been issued to 3 , 433 , 300 veterans . This in itself will mean an expenditure of nearly 3 , 500 , 000 , 000 before 1945 , in addition to the 600 , 000 , 000 which we are now appropriating annually for our veterans relief . The administration of all laws concerning the veterans and their dependents has been upon the basis of dealing generously , humanely , and justly . While some inequalities have arisen , substantial and adequate care has been given and justice administered . Further improvement in administration may require some amendment from time to time to the law , but care should be taken to see that such changes conform to the basic principles of the legislation . I am convinced that we will gain in efficiency , economy , and more uniform administration and better definition of national policies if the Pension Bureau , the National Home for Volunteer Soldiers , and the Veterans Bureau are brought together under a single agency . The total appropriations to these agencies now exceed 800 , 000 , 000 per annum . Approximately four fifths of all the employees in the executive civil service now occupy positions subject to competitive examination under the civil service law . There are , however , still commanding opportunities for extending the system . These opportunities lie within the province of Congress and not the President . I recommend that a further step be taken by authorization that appointments of third class postmasters be made under the civil service law . This subject has been under consideration for over 20 years . It was promised by both political parties in the recent campaign . It has been repeatedly examined by committees and commissions congressional , executive , and voluntary . The conclusions of these investigations have been unanimous that reorganization is a necessity of sound administration of economy of more effective governmental policies and of relief to the citizen from unnecessary harassment in his relations with a multitude of scattered governmental agencies . But the presentation of any specific plan at once enlivens opposition from every official whose authority may be curtailed or who fears his position is imperiled by such a result of bureaus and departments which wish to maintain their authority and activities of citizens and their organizations who are selfishly interested , or who are inspired by fear that their favorite bureau may , in a new setting , be less subject to their influence or more subject to some other influence . It seems to me that the essential principles of reorganization are two in number . First , all administrative activities of the same major purpose should be placed in groups under single headed responsibility second , all executive and administrative functions should be separated from boards and commissions and placed under individual responsibility , while quasi legislative and quasi judicial and broadly advisory functions should be removed from individual authority and assigned to boards and commissions . Indeed , these are the fundamental principles upon which our Government was founded , and they are the principles which have been adhered to in the whole development of our business structure , and they are the distillation of the common sense of generations . For instance , the conservation of national resources is spread among eight agencies in five departments . They suffer from conflict and overlap . There is no proper development and adherence to broad national policies and no central point where the searchlight of public opinion may concentrate itself . These functions should be grouped under the direction of some such official as an assistant secretary of conservation . The particular department or cabinet officer under which such a group should be placed is of secondary importance to the need of concentration . The same may be said of educational services , of merchant marine aids , of public works , of public health , of veterans services , and many others , the component parts of which are widely scattered in the various departments and independent agencies . It is desirable that we first have experience with these different groups in action before we create new departments . These may be necessary later on . With this background of all previous experience I can see no hope for the development of a sound reorganization of the Government unless Congress be willing to delegate its authority over the problem subject to defined principles to the Executive , who should act upon approval of a joint committee of Congress or with the reservation of power of revision by Congress within some limited period adequate for its consideration . The first duty of the President under his oath of office is to secure the enforcement of the laws . The enforcement of the laws enacted to give effect to the eighteenth amendment is far from satisfactory and this is in part due to the inadequate organization of the administrative agencies of the Federal Government . With the hope of expediting such reorganization , I requested on June 6 last that Congress should appoint a joint committee to collaborate with executive agencies in preparation of legislation . It would be helpful if it could be so appointed . The subject has been earnestly considered by the Law Enforcement Commission and the administrative officials of the Government . Our joint conclusions are that certain steps should be taken at once . First , there should be an immediate concentration of responsibility and strengthening of enforcement agencies of the Federal Government by transfer to the Department of Justice of the Federal functions of detection and to a considerable degree of prosecution , which are now lodged in the Prohibition Bureau in the Treasury and at the same time the control of the distribution of industrial alcohol and legalized beverages should remain in the Treasury . Second , provision should be made for relief of congestion in the Federal courts by modifying and simplifying the procedure for dealing with the large volume of petty prosecutions under various Federal acts . Third , there should be a codification of the laws relating to prohibition to avoid the necessity which now exists of resorting to more than 25 statutes enacted at various times over 40 years . Technical defects in these statutes that have been disclosed should be cured . I would add to these recommendations the desirability of reorganizing the various services engaged in the prevention of smuggling into one border patrol under the Coast Guard . Further recommendations upon the subject as a whole will be developed after further examination by the Law Enforcement Commission , but it is not to be expected that any criminal law will ever be fully enforced so long as criminals exist . The District of Columbia should be the model of city law enforcement in the Nation . While conditions here are much better than in many other cities , they are far from perfect , and this is due in part to the congestion of criminal cases in the Supreme Court of the District , resulting in long delays . Furthermore , there is need for legislation in the District supplementing the national prohibition act , more sharply defining and enlarging the duties and powers of the District Commissioners and the police of the District , and opening the way for better cooperation in the enforcement of prohibition between the District officials and the prohibition officers of the Federal Government . It is urgent that these conditions be remedied . No one will look with satisfaction upon the volume of crime of all kinds and the growth of organized crime in our country . We have pressing need so to organize our system of administering criminal justice as to establish full vigor and effectiveness . We need to reestablish faith that the highest interests of our country are served by insistence upon the swift and even handed administration of justice to all offenders , whether they be rich or poor . That we shall effect improvement is vital to the preservation of our institutions . It is the most serious issue before our people . Under the authority of Congress I have appointed a National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement , for an exhaustive study of the entire problem of the enforcement of our laws and the improvement of our judicial system , including the special problems and abuses growing out of the prohibition laws . The commission has been invited to make the widest inquiry into the shortcomings of the administration of justice and into the causes and remedies for them . It has organized its work under subcommittees dealing with the many contributory causes of our situation and has enlisted the aid of investigators in fields requiring special consideration . I am confident that as a result of its studies now being carried forward it will make a notable contribution to the solution of our pressing problems . Pending further legislation , the Department of Justice has been striving to weed out inefficiency wherever it exists , to stimulate activity on the part of its prosecuting officers , and to use increasing care in examining into the qualifications of those appointed to serve as prosecutors . The department is seeking systematically to strengthen the law enforcement agencies week by week and month by month , not by dramatic displays but by steady pressure by removal of negligent officials and by encouragement and assistance to the vigilant . During the course of these efforts it has been revealed that in some districts causes contributing to the congestion of criminal dockets , and to delays and inefficiency in prosecutions , have been lack of sufficient forces in the offices of United States attorneys , clerks of courts , and marshals . These conditions tend to clog the machinery of justice . The last conference of senior circuit judges has taken note of them and indorsed the department s proposals for improvement . Increases in appropriations are necessary and will be asked for in order to reenforce these offices . The orderly administration of the law involves more than the mere machinery of law enforcement . The efficient use of that machinery and a spirit in our people in support of law are alike essential . We have need for improvement in both . However much we may perfect the mechanism , still if the citizen who is himself dependent upon some laws for the protection of all that he has and all that he holds dear , shall insist on selecting the particular laws which he will obey , he undermines his own safety and that of his country . His attitude may obscure , but it can not conceal , the ugly truth that the lawbreaker , whoever he may be , is the enemy of society . We can no longer gloss over the unpleasant reality which should be made vital in the consciousness of every citizen , that he who condones or traffics with crime , who is indifferent to it and to the punishment of the criminal , or to the lax performance of official duty , is himself the most effective agency for the breakdown of society . Law can not rise above its source in good citizenship in what right minded men most earnestly believe and desire . If the law is upheld only by Government officials , then all law is at an end . Our laws are made by the people themselves theirs is the right to work for their repeal but until repeal it is an equal duty to observe them and demand their enforcement . I have been gratified at the awakening sense of this responsibility in our citizens during the past few months , and gratified that many instances have occurred which refuted the cynicism which has asserted that our system could not convict those who had defied the law and possessed the means to resist its execution . These things reveal a moral awakening both in the people and in officials which lies at the very foundation of the rule of law . The test of the rightfulness of our decisions must be whether we have sustained and advanced the ideals of the American people self government in its foundations of local government justice whether to the individual or to the group ordered liberty freedom from domination open opportunity and equality of opportunity the initiative and individuality of our people prosperity and the lessening of poverty freedom of public opinion education advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit the tolerance of all faiths the foundations of the home and the advancement of peace .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives I have the honor to comply with the requirement of the Constitution that I should lay before the Congress information as to the state of the Union , and recommend consideration of such measures as are necessary and expedient . Substantial progress has been made during the year in national peace and security the fundamental strength of the Nation s economic life is unimpaired education and scientific discovery have made advances our country is more alive to its problems of moral and spiritual welfare . During the past 12 months we have suffered with other Nations from economic depression . The origins of this depression lie to some extent within our own borders through a speculative period which diverted capital and energy into speculation rather than constructive enterprise . Had overspeculation in securities been the only force operating , we should have seen recovery many months ago , as these particular dislocations have generally readjusted themselves . Other deep seated causes have been in action , however , chiefly the world wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous times for such important basic commodities as wheat , rubber , coffee , sugar , copper , silver , zinc , to some extent cotton , and other raw materials . The cumulative effects of demoralizing price falls of these important commodities in the process of adjustment of production to world consumption have produced financial crises in many countries and have diminished the buying power of these countries for imported goods to a degree which extended the difficulties farther afield by creating unemployment in all the industrial nations . The political agitation in Asia revolutions in South America and political unrest in some European States the methods of sale by Russia of her increasing agricultural exports to European markets and our own drought have all contributed to prolong and deepen the depression . In the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside of the United States , and our recuperation has been retarded by the unwarranted degree of fear and apprehension created by these outside forces . The extent of the depression is indicated by the following approximate percentages of activity during the past three months as compared with the highly prosperous year of 1928 Value of department store sales 93 of 1928 Volume of manufacturing production 80 of 1928 Volume of mineral production 90 of 1928 Volume of factory employment 84 of 1928 Total of bank deposits 105 of 1928 Wholesale prices all commodities 83 of 1928 Cost of living 94 of 1928 Various other indexes indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from 15 to 20 per cent . There are many factors which give encouragement for the future . The fact that we are holding from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activities and incomes that our major financial and industrial institutions have come through the storm unimpaired that price levels of major commodities have remained approximately stable for some time that a number of industries are showing signs of increasing demand that the world at large is readjusting itself to the situation all reflect grounds for confidence . We should remember that these occasions have been met many times before , that they are but temporary , that our country is to day stronger and richer in resources , in equipment , in skill , than ever in its history . We are in an extraordinary degree self sustaining , we will overcome world influences and will lead the march of prosperity as we have always done hitherto . Economic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement . Economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of the economic body the producers and consumers themselves . Recovery can be expedited and its effects mitigated by cooperative action . That cooperation requires that every individual should sustain faith and courage that each should maintain his self reliance that each and every one should search for methods of improving his business or service that the vast majority whose income is unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursue their normal living and recreations that each should seek to assist his neighbors who may be less fortunate that each industry should assist its own employees that each community and each State should assume its full responsibilities for organization of employment and relief of distress with that sturdiness and independence which built a great Nation . Our people are responding to these impulses in remarkable degree . The best contribution of government lies in encouragement of this voluntary cooperation in the community . The Government , National , State , and local , can join with the community in such programs and do its part . A year ago together with other officers of the Government , initiated extensive cooperative measures throughout the country . The first of these measures was an agreement of leading employers to maintain the standards of wages and of labor leaders to use their influence against strife . In a large sense these undertakings have been adhered to and we have not witnessed the usual reductions of wages which have always heretofore marked depressions . The index of union wage scales shows them to be today fully up to the level of any of the previous three years . In consequence the buying power of the country has been much larger than would otherwise have been the case . Of equal importance the Nation has had unusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which has characterized previous depressions . The second direction of cooperation has been that our governments , National , State , and local , the industries and business so distribute employment as to give work to the maximum number of employees . The third direction of cooperation has been to maintain and even extend construction work and betterments in anticipation of the future . It has been the universal experience in previous depressions that public works and private construction have fallen off rapidly with the general tide of depression . On this occasion , however , the increased authorization and generous appropriations by the Congress and the action of States and municipalities have resulted in the expansion of public construction to an amount even above that in the most prosperous years . In addition the cooperation of public utilities , railways , and other large organizations has been generously given in construction and betterment work in anticipation of future need . The Department of Commerce advises me that as a result , the volume of this type of construction work , which amounted to roughly 6 , 300 , 000 , 000 in 1929 , instead of decreasing will show a total of about 7 , 000 , 000 , 000 for 1930 . There has , of course , been a substantial decrease in the types of construction which could not be undertaken in advance of need . The fourth direction of cooperation was the organization in such States and municipalities , as was deemed necessary , of committees to organize local employment , to provide for employment agencies , and to effect relief of distress . The result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country has been that actual suffering has been kept to a minimum during the past 12 months , and our unemployment has been far less in proportion than in other large industrial countries . Some time ago it became evident that unemployment would continue over the winter and would necessarily be added to from seasonal causes and that the savings of workpeople would be more largely depleted . We have as a Nation a definite duty to see that no deserving person in our country suffers from hunger or cold . I therefore set up a more extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation throughout the country . There has been a most gratifying degree of response , from governors , mayors , and other public officials , from welfare organizations , and from employers in concerns both large and small . The local communities through their voluntary agencies have assumed the duty of relieving individual distress and are being generously supported by the public . The number of those wholly out of employment seeking for work was accurately determined by the census last April as about 2 , 500 , 000 . The Department of Labor index of employment in the larger trades shows some decrease in employment since that time . The problem from a relief point of view is somewhat less than the published estimates of the number of unemployed would indicate . The intensive community and individual efforts in providing special employment outside the listed industries are not reflected in the statistical indexes and tend to reduce such published figures . Moreover , there is estimated to be a constant figure at all times of nearly 1 , 000 , 000 unemployed who are not without annual income but temporarily idle in the shift from one job to another . We have an average of about three breadwinners to each two families , so that every person unemployed does not represent a family without income . The view that the relief problems are less than the gross numbers would indicate is confirmed by the experience of several cities , which shows that the number of families in distress represents from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of the calculated unemployed . This is not said to minimize the very real problem which exists but to weigh its actual proportions . As a contribution to the situation the Federal Government is engaged upon the greatest program of waterway , harbor , flood control , public building , highway , and airway improvement in all our history . This , together with loans to merchant shipbuilders , improvement of the Navy and in military aviation , and other construction work of the Government will exceed 520 , 000 , 000 for this fiscal year . This compares with 253 , 000 , 000 in the fiscal year 1928 . The construction works already authorized and the continuation of policies in Government aid will require a continual expenditure upwards of half a billion dollars annually . I favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid to unemployment during this winter . The Congress will , however , have presented to it numbers of projects , some of them under the guise of , rather than the reality of , their usefulness in the increase of employment during the depression . There are certain commonsense limitations upon any expansions of construction work . The Government must not undertake works that are not of sound economic purpose and that have not been subject to searching technical investigation , and which have not been given adequate consideration by the Congress . The volume of construction work in the Government is already at the maximum limit warranted by financial prudence as a continuing policy . To increase taxation for purposes of construction work defeats its own purpose , as such taxes directly diminish employment in private industry . Again any kind of construction requires , after its authorization , a considerable time before labor can be employed in which to make engineering , architectural , and legal preparations . Our immediate problem is the increase of employment for the next six months , and new plans which do not produce such immediate result or which extend commitments beyond this period are not warranted . The enlarged rivers and harbors , public building , and highway plans authorized by the Congress last session , however , offer an opportunity for assistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these programs even faster than originally planned , especially if the technical requirements of the laws which entail great delays could be amended in such fashion as to speed up acquirements of land and the letting of contracts . With view , however , to the possible need for acceleration , we , immediately upon receiving those authorities from the Congress five months ago , began the necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality . I have canvassed the departments of the Government as to the maximum amount that can be properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate all construction during the next six months , and I feel warranted in asking the Congress for an appropriation of from 100 , 000 , 000 to 150 , 000 , 000 to provide such further employment in this emergency . In connection therewith we need some authority to make enlarged temporary advances of Federal highway aid to the States . I recommend that this appropriation be made distributable to the different departments upon recommendation of a committee of the Cabinet and approval by the President . Its application to works already authorized by the Congress assures its use in directions of economic importance and to public welfare . Such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all kinds of over 650 , 000 , 000 during the next twelve months . The world wide depression has affected agriculture in common with all other industries . The average price of farm produce has fallen to about 80 per cent of the levels of 1928 . This average is , however , greatly affected by wheat and cotton , which have participated in world wide overproduction and have fallen to about 60 per cent of the average price of the year 1928 . Excluding these commodities , the prices of all other agricultural products are about 84 per cent of those of 1928 . The average wholesale prices of other primary goods , such as nonferrous metals , have fallen to 76 per cent of 1928 . The price levels of our major agricultural commodities are , in fact , higher than those in other principal producing countries , due to the combined result of the tariff and the operations of the Farm Board . For instance , wheat prices at Minneapolis are about 30 per cent higher than at Winnipeg , and at Chicago they are about 20 per cent higher than at Buenos Aires . Corn prices at Chicago are over twice as high as at Buenos Aires . Wool prices average more than 80 per cent higher in this country than abroad , and butter is 30 per cent higher in New York City than in Copenhagen . Aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world wide depression we have had the most severe drought . It has affected particularly the States bordering on the Potomac , Ohio , and Lower Mississippi Rivers , with some areas in Montana , Kansas , Oklahoma , and Texas . It has found its major expression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop from an average of about 2 , 800 , 000 , 000 bushels to about 2 , 090 , 000 , 000 bushels . On August 14 I called a conference of the governors of the most acutely affected States , and as a result of its conclusions I appointed a national committee comprising the heads of the important Federal agencies under the chairmanship of the Secretary of Agriculture . The governors in turn have appointed State committees representative of the farmers , bankers , business men , and the Red Cross , and subsidiary committees have been established in most of the acutely affected counties . Railway rates were reduced on feed and livestock in and out of the drought areas , and over 50 , 000 cars of such products have been transported under these reduced rates . The Red Cross established a preliminary fund of 5 , 000 , 000 for distress relief purposes and established agencies for its administration in each county . Of this fund less than 500 , 000 has been called for up to this time as the need will appear more largely during the winter . The Federal Farm Loan Board has extended its credit facilities , and the Federal Farm Board has given financial assistance to all affected cooperatives . In order that the Government may meet its full obligation toward our countrymen in distress through no fault of their own , I recommend that an appropriation should be made to the Department of Agriculture to be loaned for the purpose of seed and feed for animals . Its application should as hitherto in such loans be limited to a gross amount to any one individual , and secured upon the crop . The Red Cross can relieve the cases of individual distress by the sympathetic assistance of our people . I shall submit the detailed financial position of the Government with recommendations in the usual Budget message . I will at this time , however , mention that the Budget estimates of receipts and expenditures for the current year were formulated by the Treasury and the Budget Bureau at a time when it was impossible to forecast the severity of the business depression and have been most seriously affected by it . At that time a surplus of about 123 , 000 , 000 was estimated for this fiscal year and tax reduction which affected the fiscal year to the extent of 75 , 000 , 000 was authorized by the Congress , thus reducing the estimated surplus to about 48 , 000 , 000 . Closely revised estimates now made by the Treasury and the Bureau of the Budget of the tax , postal , and other receipts for the current fiscal year indicate a decrease of about 430 , 000 , 000 from the estimate of a year ago , of which about 75 , 000 , 000 is due to tax reduction , leaving about 355 , 000 , 000 due to the depression . Moreover , legislation enacted by Congress subsequent to the submission of the Budget enlarging Federal construction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans services and other items , have increased expenditures during the current fiscal year by about 225 , 000 , 000 . Thus the decrease of 430 , 000 , 000 in revenue and the increase of 225 , 000 , 000 in expenditure adversely change the original Budget situation by about 655 , 000 , 000 . This large sum is offset by the original estimated surplus a year ago of about 123 , 000 , 000 , by the application of 185 , 000 , 000 of interest payments upon the foreign debt to current expenditures , by arrangements of the Farm Board through repayments , etc . , in consequence of which they reduced their net cash demands upon the Treasury by 100 , 000 , 000 in this period , and by about 67 , 000 , 000 economies and deferments brought about in the Government , thus reducing the practical effect of the change in the situation to an estimated deficit of about 180 , 000 , 000 for the present fiscal year . I shall make suggestions for handling the present year deficit in the Budget message , but I do not favor encroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt . While it will be necessary in public interest to further increase expenditures during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by speeding up construction work and aid to the farmers affected by the drought , I can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer any other plans for increase of Government expenditures . The Budget for 1932 fiscal year indicates estimated expenditure of about 4 , 054 , 000 , 000 , including postal deficit . The receipts are estimated at about 4 , 085 , 000 , 000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be discontinued , leaving a surplus of only about 30 , 000 , 000 . Most rigid economy is therefore necessary to avoid increase in taxes . Our Army and Navy are being maintained at a high state of efficiency , under officers of high training and intelligence , supported by a devoted personnel of the rank and file . The London naval treaty has brought important economies in the conduct of the Navy . The Navy Department will lay before the committees of the Congress recommendations for a program of authorization of new construction which should be initiated in the fiscal year of 1932 . This is the last session of the Seventy first Congress . During its previous sittings it has completed a very large amount of important legislation , notably The establishment of the Federal Farm Board fixing congressional reapportionment revision of the tariff , including the flexible provisions and a reorganization of the Tariff Commission reorganization of the Radio Commission reorganization of the Federal Power Commission expansion of Federal prisons reorganization of parole and probation system in Federal prisons expansion of veterans hospitals establishment of disability allowances to veterans consolidation of veteran activities consolidation and strengthening of prohibition enforcement activities in the Department of Justice organization of a Narcotics Bureau large expansion of rivers and harbors improvements substantial increase in Federal highways enlargement of public buildings construction program and the ratification of the London naval treaty . The Congress has before it legislation partially completed in the last sitting in respect to Muscle Shoals , bus regulation , relief of congestion in the courts , reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling , law enforcement in the District of Columbia , and other subjects . It is desirable that these measures should be completed . The short session does not permit of extensive legislative programs , but there are a number of questions which , if time does not permit action , I recommend should be placed in consideration by the Congress , perhaps through committees cooperating in some instances with the Federal departments , with view to preparation for subsequent action . Among them are the following subjects I have in a previous message recommended effective regulation of interstate electrical power . Such regulation should preserve the independence and responsibility of the States . We have determined upon a national policy of consolidation of the railways as a necessity of more stable and more economically operated transportation . Further legislation is necessary to facilitate such consolidation . In the public interest we should strengthen the railways that they may meet our future needs . I recommend that the Congress institute an inquiry into some aspects of the economic working of these laws . I do not favor repeal of the Sherman Act . The prevention of monopolies is of most vital public importance . Competition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer but is the incentive to progress . However , the interpretation of these laws by the courts , the changes in business , especially in the economic effects upon those enterprises closely related to the use of the natural resources of the country , make such an inquiry advisable . The producers of these materials assert that certain unfortunate results of wasteful and destructive use of these natural resources together with a destructive competition which impoverishes both operator and worker can not be remedied because of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust laws . The well known condition of the bituminous coal industry is an illustration . The people have a vital interest in the conservation of their natural resources in the prevention of wasteful practices in conditions of destructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wage earner and they have an equal interest in maintaining adequate competition . I therefore suggest that an inquiry be directed especially to the effect of the workings of the antitrust laws in these particular fields to determine if these evils can be remedied without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these laws . It is urged by many thoughtful citizens that the peculiar economic effect of the income tax on so called capital gains at the present rate is to enhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery . I believe this to be the case and I recommend that a study be made of the economic effects of this tax and of its relation to the general structure of our income tax law . There is need for revision of our immigration laws upon a more limited and more selective basis , flexible to the needs of the country . Under conditions of current unemployment it is obvious that persons coming to the United States seeking work would likely become either a direct or indirect public charge . As a temporary measure the officers issuing visas to immigrants have been , in pursuance of the law , instructed to refuse visas to applicants likely to fall into this class . As a result the visas issued have decreased from an average of about 24 , 000 per month prior to restrictions to a rate of about 7 , 000 during the last month . These are largely preferred persons under the law . Visas from Mexico are about 250 per month compared to about 4 , 000 previous to restrictions . The whole subject requires exhaustive reconsideration . I urge the strengthening of our deportation laws so as to more fully rid ourselves of criminal aliens . Furthermore , thousands of persons have entered the country in violation of the immigration laws . The very method of their entry indicates their objectionable character , and our law abiding foreign born residents suffer in consequence . I recommend that the Congress provide methods of strengthening the Government to correct this abuse . Due to deferment of Government building over many years , previous administrations had been compelled to enter upon types of leases for secondary facilities in large cities , some of which were objectionable as representing too high a return upon the value of the property . To prevent the occasion for further uneconomic leasing I recommend that the Congress authorize the building by the Government of its own facilities . The Nation has generously expanded its care for veterans . The consolidation of all veterans activities into the Veterans Administration has produced substantial administrative economies . The consolidation also brings emphasis to the inequalities in service and allowances . The whole subject is under study by the administrator , and I recommend it should also be examined by the committees of the Congress . I urge further consideration by the Congress of the recommendations I made a year ago looking to the development through temporary Federal aid of adequate State and local services for the health of children and the further stamping out of communicable disease , particularly in the rural sections . The advance of scientific discovery , methods , and social thought imposes a new vision in these matters . The drain upon the Federal Treasury is comparatively small . The results both economic and moral are of the utmost importance . It is my belief that after the passing of this depression , when we can examine it in retrospect , we shall need to consider a number of other questions as to what action may be taken by the Government to remove Possible governmental influences which make for instability and to better organize mitigation of the effect of depression . It is as yet too soon to constructively formulate such measures . There are many administrative subjects , such as departmental reorganization , extension of the civil service , readjustment of the postal rates , etc . , which at some appropriate time require the attention of the Congress . Our relations with foreign countries have been maintained upon a high basis of cordiality and good will . During the past year the London naval pact was completed , approved by the Senate , and ratified by the governments concerned . By this treaty we have abolished competition in the building of warships , have established the basis of parity of the United States with the strongest of foreign powers , and have accomplished a substantial reduction in war vessels . During the year there has been an extended political unrest in the world . Asia continues in disturbed condition , and revolutions have taken place in Brazil , Argentina , Peru , and Bolivia . Despite the jeopardy to our citizens and their property which naturally arises in such circumstances , we have , with the cooperation of the governments concerned , been able to meet all such instances without friction . We have resumed normal relations with the new Governments of Brazil , Argentina , Peru , and Bolivia immediately upon evidence that they were able to give protection to our citizens and their property , and that they recognized their international obligations . A commission which was supported by the Congress has completed its investigation and reported upon our future policies in respect to Haiti and proved of high value in securing the acceptance of these policies . An election has been held and a new government established . We have replaced our high commissioner by a minister and have begun the gradual withdrawal of our activities with view to complete retirement at the expiration of the present treaty in 1935 . A number of arbitration and conciliation treaties have been completed or negotiated during the year , and will be presented for approval by the Senate . I shall , in a special message , lay before the Senate the protocols covering the statutes of the World Court which have been revised to accord with the sense of previous Senate reservations .<speech_sep>
