The American Government proposes the postponement during 1 year of all payments on intergovernmental debts , reparations , and relief debts , both principal and interest , of course , not including obligations of governments held by private parties . Subject to confirmation by Congress , the American Government will postpone all payments upon the debts of foreign governments to the American Government payable during the fiscal year beginning July 1 next , conditional on a like postponement for 1 year of all payments on intergovernmental debts owing the important creditor powers . This course of action has been approved by the following Senators Henry Ashurst , Hiram Bingham , William Borah , James Byrnes , Arthur Capper , Simeon Fess , Duncan Fletcher , Carter Glass , William Harris , Pat Harrison , Cordell Hull , William King , Dwight Morrow , George Moses , David Reed , Claude Swanson , Arthur Vandenberg , Robert Wagner , David Walsh , Thomas Walsh , James Watson and by the following Representatives Isaac Bacharach , Joseph Byrns , Carl Chindblom , Frank Crowther , James Collier , Charles Crisp , Thomas Cullen , George Darrow , Harry Estep , Willis Hawley , Carl Mapes , McLaughlin , Earl Michener , William Ramseyer , Bertrand Snell , John The purpose of this action is to give the forthcoming year to the economic recovery of the world and to help free the recuperative forces already in motion in the United States from retarding influences from abroad . The worldwide depression has affected the countries of Europe more severely than our own . Some of these countries are feeling to a serious extent the drain of this depression on national economy . The fabric of intergovernmental debts , supportable in normal times , weighs heavily in the midst of this depression . From a variety of causes arising out of the depression such as the fall in the price of foreign commodities and the lack of confidence in economic and political stability abroad there is an abnormal movement of gold into the United States which is lowering the credit stability of many foreign countries . These and the other difficulties abroad diminish buying power for our exports and in a measure are the cause of our continued unemployment and continued lower prices to our farmers . Wise and timely action should contribute to relieve the pressure of these adverse forces in foreign countries and should assist in the reestablishment of confidence , thus forwarding political peace and economic stability in the world . Authority of the President to deal with this problem is limited as this action must be supported by the Congress . It has been assured the cordial support of leading Members of both parties in the Senate and the House . The essence of this proposition is to give time to permit debtor governments to recover their national prosperity . I am suggesting to the American people that they be wise creditors in their own interest and be good neighbors . I wish to take this occasion also to frankly state my views upon our relations to German reparations and the debts owed to us by the Allied Governments of Europe . Our Government has not been a party to , or exerted any voice in determination of reparation obligations . We purposely did not participate in either general reparations or the division of colonies or property . The repayment of debts due to us from the Allies for the advance for war and reconstruction were settled upon a basis not contingent upon German reparations or related thereto . Therefore , reparations is necessarily wholly a European problem with which we have no relation . I do not approve in any remote sense of the cancellation of the debts to us . World confidence would not be enhanced by such action . None of our debtor nations have ever suggested it . But as the basis of the settlement of these debts was the capacity under normal conditions of the debtor to pay , we should be consistent with our own policies and principles if we take into account the abnormal situation now existing in the world . I am sure the American people have no desire to attempt to extract any sum beyond the capacity of any debtor to pay and it is our view that broad vision requires that our Government should recognize the situation as it exists . This course of action is entirely consistent with the policy which we have hitherto pursued . We are not involved in the discussion of strictly European problems , of which the payment of German reparations is one . It represents our willingness to make a contribution to the early restoration of world prosperity in which our own people have so deep an interest . I wish further to add that while this action has no bearing on the conference for limitation of land armaments to be held next February , inasmuch as the burden of competitive armaments has contributed to bring about this depression , we trust that by this evidence of our desire to assist we shall have contributed to the good will which is so necessary in the solution of this major question .<speech_sep>This campaign now draws near a close . The platforms of the two parties defining principles and offering solutions of various national problems have been presented and are being earnestly considered by our people . After four months debate it is not the Republican Party which finds reason for abandonment of any of the principles it has laid down , or of the views it has expressed for solution of the problems before the country . The principles to which it adheres are rooted deeply in the foundations of our national life . The solutions which it proposes are based on experience with government and on a consciousness that it may have the responsibility for placing those solutions in action . In my acceptance speech I endeavored to outline the spirit and ideals by which I would be guided in carrying that platform into administration . Tonight , I will not deal with the multitude of issues which have been already well canvassed . I intend rather to discuss some of those more fundamental principles and ideals upon which I believe the Government of the United States should be conducted . The Republican Party has ever been a party of progress . I do not need to review its seventy years of constructive history . It has always reflected the spirit of the American people . Never has it done more for the advancement of fundamental progress than during the past seven and a half years since we took over the Government amidst the ruin left by war . It detracts nothing from the character and energy of the American people , it minimizes in no degree the quality of their accomplishments to say that the policies of the Republican Party have played a large part in recuperation from the war and the building of the magnificent progress which shows upon every hand today . I say with emphasis that without the wise policies which the Republican Party has brought into action during this period , no such progress would have been possible . The first responsibility of the Republican Administration was to renew the march of progress from its collapse by the war . That task involved the restoration of confidence in the future and the liberation and stimulation of the constructive energies of our people . It discharged that task . There is not a person within the sound of my voice that does not know the profound progress which our country has made in this period . Every man and woman knows that American comfort , hope and confidence for the future are immeasurably higher this day than they were seven and one half years ago . It is not my purpose to enter upon a detailed recital of the great constructive measures of the past seven and a half years by which this has been brought about . It is sufficient to remind you of the restoration of employment to the millions who walked your streets in idleness to remind you of the creation of the budget system the reduction of six billions of national debt which gave the powerful impulse of that vast sum returned to industry and commerce the four sequent reductions of taxes and thereby the lift to the living of every family the enactment of adequate protective tariff and immigration laws which have safeguarded our workers and farmers from floods of goods and labor from foreign countries the creation of credit facilities and many other aids to agriculture the building up of foreign trade the care of veterans the development of aviation , of radio , of our inland waterways , of our highways the expansion of scientific research , of welfare activities , the making of safer highways , safer mines , better homes the spread of outdoor recreation the improvement in public health and the care of children and a score of other progressive actions . Nor do I need to remind you that Government today deals with an economic and social system vastly more intricate and delicately adjusted than ever before . That system now must be kept in perfect tune if we would maintain uninterrupted employment and the high standards of living of our people . The Government has come to touch this delicate web at a thousand points . Yearly the relations of Government to national prosperity become more and more intimate . Only through keen vision and helpful cooperation by the Government has stability in business and stability in employment been maintained during this past seven and a half years . There always are some localities , some industries and some individuals who do not share the prevailing prosperity . The task of government is to lessen these inequalities . Never has there been a period when the Federal Government has given such aid and impulse to the progress of our people , not alone to economic progress but to the development of those agencies which make for moral and spiritual progress . But in addition to this great record of contributions of the Republican Party to progress , there has been a further fundamental contribution a contribution underlying and sustaining all the others and that is the resistance of the Republican Party to every attempt to inject the Government into business in competition with its citizens . After the war , when the Republican Party assumed administration of the country , we were faced with the problem of determination of the very nature of our national life . During 150 years we have builded up a form of self government and a social system which is peculiarly our own . It differs essentially from all others in the world . It is the American system . It is just as definite and positive a political and social system as has ever been developed on earth . It is founded upon a particular conception of self government in which decentralized local responsibility is the very base . Further than this , it is founded upon the conception that only through ordered liberty , freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress . And in our insistence upon equality of opportunity has our system advanced beyond all the world . During the war we necessarily turned to the Government to solve every difficult economic problem . The Government having absorbed every energy of our people for war , there was no other solution . For the preservation of the State , the Federal Government became a centralized despotism which undertook unprecedented responsibilities , assumed autocratic powers , and took over the business of citizens . To a large degree we regimented our whole people temporarily into a socialistic state . However justified in time of war , if continued in peace time it would destroy not only our American system but with it our progress and freedom as well . When the war closed , the most vital of all issues both in our own country and throughout the world was whether Governments should continue their wartime ownership and operation of many instrumentalities of production and distribution . We were challenged with a peace time choice between the American system of rugged individualism and a European philosophy of diametrically opposed doctrines doctrines of paternalism and state socialism . The acceptance of these ideas would have meant the destruction of self government through centralization of government . It would have meant the undermining of the individual initiative and enterprise through which our people have grown to unparalleled greatness . The Republican Party from the beginning resolutely turned its face away from these ideas and these war practices . A Republican Congress cooperated with the Democratic administration to demobilize many of our war activities . At that time the two parties were accord upon that point . When the Republican Party came into full power , it went at once resolutely back to our fundamental conception of the state and the rights and responsibilities of the individual . Thereby it restored confidence and hope in the American people , it freed and stimulated enterprise , it restored the Government to its position as an umpire instead of a player in the economic game . For these reasons the American people have gone forward in progress while the rest of the world has halted , and some countries have even gone backwards . If anyone will study the causes of retarded recuperation in Europe , he will find much of it due to the stifling of private initiative on one hand , and overloading of the Government with business on the other . There has been revived in this campaign , however , a series of proposals which , if adopted , would be a long step toward the abandonment of our American system and a surrender to the destructive operation of governmental conduct of commercial business . Because the country is faced with difficulty and doubt over certain national problems that is , prohibition , farm relief and electrical power our opponents propose that we must thrust government a long way into the businesses which give rise to these problems . In effect , they abandon the tenets of their own party and turn to state socialism as a solution for the difficulties presented by all three . It is proposed that we shall change from prohibition to the state purchase and sale of liquor . If their agricultural relief program means anything , it means that the Government shall directly or indirectly buy and sell and fix prices of agricultural products . And we are to go into the hydroelectric power business . In other words , we are confronted with a huge program of government in business . There is , therefore , submitted to the American people a question of fundamental principle . That is shall we depart from the principles of our American political and economic system , upon which we have advanced beyond all the rest of the world , in order to adopt methods based on principles destructive of its very foundations And I wish to emphasize the seriousness of these proposals . I wish to make my position clear for this goes to the very roots of American life and progress . I should like to state to you the effect that this projection of government in business would have upon our system of self government and our economic system . That effect would reach to the daily life of every man and woman . It would impair the very basis of liberty and freedom not only for those left outside the fold of expanded bureaucracy but for those embraced within it . Let us first see the effect upon self government . When the Federal Government undertakes to go into commercial business , it must at once set up the organization and administration of that business , and it immediately finds itself in a labyrinth , every alley of which leads to the destruction of self government . Commercial business requires a concentration of responsibility . Self government requires decentralization and many checks and balances to safeguard liberty . Our Government to succeed in business would need become in effect a despotism . There at once begins the destruction of self government . The first problem of the government about to adventure in commercial business is to determine a method of administration . It must secure leadership and direction . Shall this leadership be chosen by political agencies or shall we make it elective The hard practical fact is that leadership in business must come through the sheer rise in ability and character . That rise can only take place in the free atmosphere of competition . Competition is closed by bureaucracy . Political agencies are feeble channels through which to select able leaders to conduct commercial business . Government , in order to avoid the possible incompetence , corruption and tyranny of too great authority in individuals entrusted with commercial business , inevitably turns to boards and commissions . To make sure that there are checks and balances , each member of such boards and commissions must have equal authority . Each has his separate responsibility to the public , and at once we have the conflict of ideas and the lack of decision which would ruin any commercial business . It has contributed greatly to the demoralization of our shipping business . Moreover , these commissions must be representative of different sections and different political parties , so that at once we have an entire blight upon coordinated action within their ranks which destroys any possibility of effective administration . Moreover , our legislative bodies cannot in fact delegate their full authority to commissions or to individuals for the conduct of matters vital to the American people for if we would preserve government by the people we must preserve the authority of our legislators in the activities of our government . Thus every time the Federal Government goes into a commercial business , 531 Senators and Congressmen become the actual board of directors of that business . Every time a state government goes into business , one or two hundred state senators and legislators become the actual directors of that business . Even if they were supermen and if there were no politics in the United States , no body of such numbers could competently direct commercial activities for that requires initiative , instant decision . and action . It took Congress six years of constant discussion to even decide what the method of administration of Muscle Shoals should be . When the Federal Government undertakes to go into business , the state governments are at once deprived of control and taxation of that business when a state government undertakes to go into business , it at once deprives the municipalities of taxation and control of that business . Municipalities , being local and close to the people , can , at times , succeed in business where Federal and State Governments must fail . We have trouble enough with log rolling in legislative bodies today . It originates naturally from desires of citizens to advance their particular section or to secure some necessary service . It would be multiplied a thousandfold were the Federal and state governments in these businesses . The effect upon our economic progress would be even worse . Business progressiveness is dependent on competition . New methods and new ideas are the outgrowth of the spirit of adventure , of individual initiative and of individual enterprise . Without adventure there is no progress . No government administration can rightly take chances with taxpayers money . There is no better example of the practical incompetence of government to conduct business than the history of our railways . During the war , the government found it necessary to operate the railways . That operation continued until after the war . In the year before being freed from Government operation , they were not able to meet the demands for transportation . Eight years later we find them under private enterprise transporting 15 per cent more goods and meeting every demand for service . Rates have been reduced by 15 per cent and net earnings increased from less than 1 per cent on their valuation to about 5 per cent . Wages of employees have improved by 13 per cent . The wages of railway employees are today 121 per cent above pre war , while the wages of Government employees are today only 65 per cent above pre war . That should be a sufficient commentary upon the efficiency of Government operation . Let us now examine this question from the point of view of the person who may get a Government job and is admitted into the new bureaucracy . Upon that subject let me quote from a speech of that great leader of labor , Samuel Gompers , delivered in Montreal in 1920 , a few years before his death . He said I believe there is no man to whom I would take second position in my loyalty to the Republic of the United States , and yet I would not give it more power over the individual citizenship of our country . It is a question of whether it shall be Government ownership or private ownership under control . If I were in the minority of one in this convention , I would want to cast my vote so that the men of labor shall not willingly enslave themselves to Government authority in their industrial effort for freedom . Let the future tell the story of who is right or who is wrong who has stood for freedom and who has been willing to submit their fate industrially to the Government . I would amplify Gompers statement . The great body of Government employees which would be created by the proposals of our opponents would either comprise a political machine at the disposal of the party in power , or alternatively , to prevent this , the Government by stringent civil service rules must debar its employees from their full political rights as free men . It must limit them in the liberty to bargain for their own wages , for no Government employee can strike against his Government and thus against the whole people . It makes a legislative body with all its political currents their final employer and master . Their bargaining does not rest upon economic need or economic strength but on political potence . But what of those who are outside the bureaucracy What is the effect upon their lives The area of enterprise and opportunity for them to strive and rise is at once limited . The Government in commercial business does not tolerate amongst its customers the freedom of competitive reprisals to which private business is subject . Bureaucracy does not tolerate the spirit of independence it spreads the spirit of submission into our daily life and penetrates the temper of our people not with the habit of powerful resistance to wrong but with the habit of timid acceptance of irresistible might . Bureaucracy is ever desirous of spreading its influence and its power . You cannot extend the mastery of the government over the daily working life of a people without at the same time making it the master of the people s souls and thoughts . Every expansion of government in business means that government in order to protect itself from the political consequences of its errors and wrongs is driven irresistibly without peace to greater and greater control of the nations press and platform . Free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die . It is a false liberalism that interprets itself into the Government operation of commercial business . Every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poisons the very roots of liberalism that is , political equality , free speech , free assembly , free press , and equality of opportunity . It is the road not to more liberty , but to less liberty . Liberalism should be found not striving to spread bureaucracy but striving to set bounds to it . True liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of all other blessings and benefits is vain . That belief is the foundation of all American progress , political as well as economic . Liberalism is a force truly of the spirit , a force proceeding from the deep realization that economic freedom cannot be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved , Even if governmental conduct of business could give us more efficiency instead of less efficiency , the fundamental objection to it would remain unaltered and unabated . It would destroy political equality . It would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption . It would stifle initiative and invention . It would undermine the development of leadership . It would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energies of our people . It would extinguish equality and opportunity . It would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress . For these reasons primarily it must be resisted . For a hundred and fifty years liberalism has found its true spirit in the American system , not in the European systems . I do not wish to be misunderstood in this statement . I am defining a general policy . It does not mean that our government is to part with one iota of its national resources without complete protection to the public interest . I have already stated that where the government is engaged in public works for purposes of flood control , of navigation , of irrigation , of scientific research or national defense , or in pioneering a new art , it will at times necessarily produce power or commodities as a by product . But they must be a by product of the major purpose , not the major purpose itself . Nor do I wish to be misinterpreted as believing that the United States is free for all and devil take the hind most . The very essence of equality of opportunity and of American individualism is that there shall be no domination by any group or combination in this Republic , whether it be business or political . On the contrary , it demands economic justice as well as political and social justice . It is no system of laissez faire . I feel deeply on this subject because during the war I had some practical experience with governmental operation and control . I have witnessed not only at home but abroad the many failures of government in business . I have seen its tyrannies , its injustices , its destructions of self government , its undermining of the very instincts which carry our people forward to progress . I have witnessed the lack of advance , the lowered standards of living , the depressed spirits of people working under such a system . My objection is based not upon theory or upon a failure to recognize wrong or abuse , but I know the adoption of such methods would strike at the very roots of American life and would destroy the very basis of American progress . Our people have the right to know whether we can continue to solve our great problems without abandonment of our American system . I know we can . We have demonstrated that our system is responsive enough to meet any new and intricate development in our economic and business life . We have demonstrated that we can meet any economic problem and still maintain our democracy as master in its own house and that we can at the same time preserve equality of opportunity and individual freedom . In the last fifty years we have discovered that mass production will produce articles for us at half the cost they required previously . We have seen the resultant growth of large units of production and distribution . This is big business . Many businesses must be bigger for our tools are bigger , our country is bigger . We now build a single dynamo of a hundred thousand horsepower . Even fifteen years ago that would have been a big business all by itself . Yet today advance in production requires that we set ten of these units together in a row . The American people from bitter experience have a rightful fear that great business units might be used to dominate our industrial life and by illegal and unethical practices destroy equality of opportunity . Years ago the Republican Administration established the principle that such evils could be corrected by regulation . It developed methods by which abuses could be prevented while the full value of industrial progress could be retained for the public . It insisted upon the principle that when great public utilities were clothed with the security of partial monopoly , whether it be railways , power plants , telephones or what not , then there must be the fullest and most complete control of rates , services , and finances by government or local agencies . It declared that these businesses must be conducted with glass pockets . As to our great manufacturing and distributing industries , the Republican Party insisted up on the enactment of laws that not only would maintain competition but would destroy conspiracies to destroy the smaller units or dominate and limit the equality of opportunity amongst our people . One of the great problems of government is to determine to what extent the Government shall regulate and control commerce and industry and how much it shall leave it alone . No system is perfect . We have had many abuses in the private conduct of business . That every good citizen resents . It is just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business . Nor am I setting up the contention that our institutions are perfect . No human ideal is ever perfectly attained , since humanity itself is not perfect . The wisdom of our forefathers in their conception that progress can only be attained as the sum of the accomplishment of free individuals has been re enforced by all of the great leaders of the country since that day . Jackson , Lincoln , Cleveland , McKinley , Roosevelt , Wilson , and Coolidge have stood unalterably for these principles . And what have been the results of our American system Our country has become the land of opportunity to those born without inheritance , not merely because of the wealth of its resources and industry but because of this freedom of initiative and enterprise . Russia has natural resources equal to ours . Her people are equally industrious , but she has not had the blessings of 150 years of our form of government and of our social system . By adherence to the principles of decentralized self government , ordered liberty , equal opportunity and freedom to the individual , our American experiment in human welfare has yielded a degree of well being unparalleled in all the world . It has come nearer to the abolition of poverty , to the abolition of fear of want , than humanity has ever reached before . Progress of the past seven years is the proof of it . This alone furnishes the answer to our opponents who ask us to introduce destructive elements into the system by which this has been accomplished . Let us see what this system has done for us in our recent years of difficult and trying reconstruction and let us then solemnly ask ourselves if we now wish to abandon it . As a nation we came out of the war with great losses . We made no profits from it . The apparent increases in wages were at that time fictitious . We were poorer as a nation when we emerged from the war . Yet during these last eight years , we have recovered from these losses and increased our national income by over one third even if we discount the inflation of the dollar . That there has been a wide diffusion of our gain in wealth and income is marked by a hundred proofs . I know of no better test of the improved conditions of the average family than the combined increase in assets of life and industrial insurance , building and loan associations , and savings deposits . These are the savings banks of the average man . These agencies alone have in seven years increased by nearly 100 per cent to the gigantic sum of over 50 billions of dollars , or nearly one sixth of our whole national wealth . We have increased in home ownership , we have expanded the investments of the average man . In addition t o these evidences of larger savings , our people are steadily increasing their spending for higher standards of living . Today there are almost 9 automobiles for each 10 families , where seven and a half years ago only enough automobiles were running to average less than 4 for each 10 families . The slogan of progress is changing from the full dinner pail to the full garage . Our people have more to eat , better things to wear , and better homes . We have even gained in elbow room , for the increase of residential floor space is over 25 per cent with less than 10 per cent increase in our number of people . Wages have increased , the cost of living has decreased . The job to every man and woman has been made more secure . We have in this short period decreased the fear of poverty , the fear of unemployment , the fear of old age and these are fears that are the greatest calamities of human kind . All this progress means far more than greater creature comforts . It finds a thousand interpretations into a greater and fuller life . A score of new helps save the drudgery of the home . In seven years we have added 70 per cent to the electric power at the elbow of our workers and further promoted them from carriers of burdens to directors of machines . We have steadily reduced the sweat in human labor . Our hours of labor are lessened our leisure has increased . We have expanded our parks and playgrounds . We have nearly doubled our attendance at games . We pour into outdoor recreation in every direction . The visitors at our national parks have trebled and we have so increased the number of sportsmen fishing in our streams and lakes that the longer time between bites is becoming a political issue . In these seven and one half years the radio has brought music and laughter , education and political discussion to almost every fireside . Springing from our prosperity with its greater freedom , its vast endowment of scientific research and the greater resources with which to care for public health , we have according to our insurance actuaries during this short period since the war lengthened the average span of life by nearly eight years . We have reduced infant mortality , we have vastly decreased the days of illness and suffering in the life of every man and woman . We have improved the facilities for the care of the crippled and helpless and deranged . From our increasing resources we have expanded our educational system in eight years from an outlay of 1 , 200 millions to 2 , 700 millions of dollars . The education of our youth has become almost our largest and certainly our most important activity . From our greater income and thus our ability to free youth from toil we have increased the attendance in our grade schools by 14 per cent , in our high schools by 80 per cent , and in our institutions of higher learning by 95 per cent . Today we have more youth in these institutions of higher learning twice over than all the rest of the world put together . We have made notable progress in literature , in art and in public taste . We have made progress in the leadership of every branch of American life . Never in our history was the leadership in our economic life more distinguished in its abilities than today , and it has grown greatly in its consciousness of public responsibility . Leadership in our professions and in moral and spiritual affairs of our country was never of a higher order . And our magnificent educational system is bringing forward a host of recruits for the succession to this leadership . I do not need to recite more figures and more evidence . I cannot believe that the American people wish to abandon or in any way to weaken the principles of economic freedom and self government which have been maintained by the Republican Party and which have produced results so amazing and so stimulating to the spiritual as well as to the material advance of the nation . Your city has been an outstanding beneficiary of this great progress and of these safeguarded principles . With its suburbs it has , during the last seven and a half years , grown by over a million and a half of people until it has become the largest metropolitan district of all the world . Here you have made abundant opportunity not only for the youth of the land but for the immigrant from foreign shores . This city is the commercial center of the United States . It is the commercial agent of the American people . It is a great organism of specialized skill and leadership in finance , industry and commerce , which reaches every spot in our country . Its progress and its beauty are the pride of the whole American people . It leads our nation in its benevolences to charity , to education and scientific research . It is the center of art , music , literature and drama . It has come to have a more potent voice than any other city in the United States . But when all is said and done the very life , progress and prosperity of this city is wholly dependent on the prosperity of the 115 , 000 , 000 people who dwell in our mountains and valleys across the 3 , 000 miles to the Pacific Ocean . Every activity of this city is sensitive to every evil and every favorable tide that sweeps this great nation of ours . Be there a slackening of industry in any place it affects New York far more than any other part of the country . In a time of depression one quarter of all the unemployed in the United States can be numbered in this city . In a time of prosperity the citizens of the great interior of our country pour into your city for business and entertainment at the rate of 150 , 000 a day . In fact , so much is this city the reflex of the varied interests of our country that the concern of everyone of your citizens for national stability , for national prosperity , for national progress , for preservation of our American system , is far greater than that of any other single part of our country . We still have great problems if we would achieve the full economic advancement of our country . In these past few years some groups in our country have lagged behind others in the march of progress . I refer more particularly to those engaged in the textile , coal and in the agricultural industries . We can assist in solving these problems by cooperation of our Government . To the agricultural industry we shall need to advance initial capital to assist them to stabilize their industry . But this proposal implies that they shall conduct it themselves , and not by the Government . It is in the interest of our cities that we shall bring agriculture and all industries into full stability and prosperity . I know you will gladly cooperate in the faith that in the common prosperity of our country lies its future . In bringing this address to a conclusion I should like to restate to you some of the fundamental things I have endeavored to bring out . The foundations of progress and prosperity are dependent as never before upon the wise policies of government , for government now touches at a thousand points the intricate web of economic and social life . Under administration by the Republican Party in the last 7 1 2 years our country as a whole has made unparalleled progress and this has been in generous part reflected to this great city . Prosperity is no idle expression . It is a job for every worker it is the safety and the safeguard of every business and every home . A continuation of the policies of the Republican Party is fundamentally necessary to the further advancement of this progress and to the further building up of this prosperity . I have dwelt at some length on the principles of relationship between the Government and business . I make no apologies for dealing with this subject . The first necessity of any nation is the smooth functioning of the vast business machinery for employment , feeding , clothing , housing and providing luxuries and comforts to a people . Unless these basic elements are properly organized and function , there can be no progress in business in education , literature , music or art . There can be no advance in the fundamental ideals of a people . A people cannot make progress in poverty . I have endeavored to present to you that the greatness of America has grown out of a political and social system and a method of control of economic forces distinctly its own our American system which has carried this great experiment in human welfare farther than ever before in all history . We are nearer today to the ideal of the abolition of poverty and fear from the lives of men and women than ever before in any land . And I again repeat that the departure from our American system by injecting principles destructive to it which our opponents propose will jeopardize the very liberty and freedom of our people , will destroy equality of opportunity not alone to ourselves but to our children . To me the foundation of American life rests upon the home and the family . I read into these great economic forces , these intricate and delicate relations of the Government with business and with our political and social life , but one supreme end that we reinforce the ties that bind together the millions of our families , that we strengthen the security , the happiness and the independence of every home . My conception of America is a land where men and women may walk in ordered freedom in the independent conduct of their occupations where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth , not concentrated in the hands of the few but spread through the lives of all , where they build and safeguard their homes , and give to their children the fullest advantages and opportunities of American life where every man shall be respected in the faith that his conscience and his heart direct him to follow where a contented and happy people , secure in their liberties , free from poverty and fear , shall have the leisure and impulse to seek a fuller life . Some may ask where all this may lead beyond mere material progress . It leads to a release of the energies of men and women from the dull drudgery of life to a wider vision and a higher hope . It leads to the opportunity for greater and greater service , not alone from man to man in our own land , but from our country to the whole world . It leads to an America , healthy in body , healthy in spirit , unfettered , youthful , eager with a vision searching beyond the farthest horizons , with an open mind sympathetic and generous . It is to these higher ideals and for these purposes that I pledge myself and the Republican Party .<speech_sep>In my messages of June 6th and December 3rd , 1929 , I placed before Congress the urgency of certain improvements necessary to effective criminal law enforcement . Substantial progress has been made upon some of the measures proposed , yet we are nearing the end of the present session , and I cannot too strongly urge the necessity of action upon all these recommendations before adjournment . The most important recommendations made by me were five in number 1 . There should be a transfer of the functions of detection and prosecution of prohibition cases from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice , and thus an ending of divided responsibility and effort . An Act providing for this transfer was passed by the House of Representatives and has now been reported to the Senate by its Judiciary Committee . 2 . There must be relief afforded from congestion in the courts . While this congestion is evidenced by the dockets in many courts , its full implications are not shown by them . The so called Bargain Days , when light fines are imposed as the result of pleas of guilty , clear the docket but the result distinctly undermines respect for law . No conclusion appears to have been reached as to the method of accomplishing this either by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate or by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives . 3 . There must be extension of federal prisons with more adequate parole system and other modern treatment of prisoners . We have already 11 , 985 prisoners in federal establishments built for 6 , 946 . The number of federal prisoners in federal and state institutions increased 6 , 277 in the nine months from June 30 , 1929 , to April 1 , 1930 . The Attorney General has stated that we cannot hope to enforce the laws unless we can have some point of reception for convicted persons . The overcrowding of the prisons themselves is inhumane and accentuates criminal tendencies . Bills providing for this relief were passed by the House and are now , I understand , in course of being reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee . 4 . We are in need of vigorous reorganization of the Border Patrol in order to consolidate various agencies so as effectually to prevent illegal entry of both aliens and goods . Proposals to bring about such reorganization are before the Committees of Congress . 5 . The District of Columbia is without an adequate prohibition enforcement law . A bill for that purpose has been introduced and hearings have been held before the Senate District Committee . It should contain the safeguards recommended by the Attorney General . We have within the limits of existing legislation improved the personnel and greatly increased the efficiency of the existing federal machinery in criminal law enforcement during the past year . The above reforms are necessary , however , if I am to perform the high duty which fails upon the Executive of enforcement of the federal laws . While a considerable part of this condition arises from the laws relating to intoxicating liquors , yet the laws relating to narcotics , automobile thefts , etc . , which have been enacted by the Congress during recent years , also contribute to create the present conditions . This is well indicated by the fact that less than one third of federal prisoners are due to prohibition . Our obedience to law , our law enforcement and judicial organization , our judicial procedure , our care and methods of handling prisoners , in relation to not only federal government but also to the state and municipal governments , are far from the standards that must be secured . These proposals , while they do not comprehend the whole which remains to be done in the nation , are a step toward lifting the federal standards which must have a general beneficial influence .<speech_sep>I SHALL approve the tariff bill . This legislation has now been under almost continuous consideration by Congress for nearly 15 months . It was undertaken as the result of pledges given by the Republican Party at Kansas City . Its declarations embraced these obligations The Republican Party believes that the home market built up under the protective policy belongs to the American farmer , and it pledges its support of legislation which will give this market to him to the full extent of his ability to supply it . . . . There are certain industries which cannot now successfully compete with foreign producers because of lower foreign wages and a lower cost of living abroad , and we pledge the next Republican Congress to an examination and where necessary a revision of these schedules to the end that the American labor in these industries may again command the home market , may maintain its standard of living , and may count upon steady employment in its accustomed field . Platform promises must not be empty gestures . In my message of April 16 , 1929 , to the special session of the Congress I accordingly recommended an increase in agricultural protection a limited revision of other schedules to take care of the economic changes necessitating increases or decreases since the enactment of the 1922 law , and I further recommended a reorganization both of the Tariff Commission and of the method of executing the flexible provisions . A statistical estimate of the bill by the Tariff Commission shows that the average duties collected under the 1922 law were about 13 . 8 percent of the value of all imports , both free and dutiable , while if the new law had been applied it would have increased this percentage to about 16 . 0 percent . This compares with the average level of the tariff under The McKinley law of 23 . 0 The Wilson law of 20 . 9 The Dingley law of 25 . 8 The Payne Aldrich law of 19 . 3 The Fordney McCumber law of 13 . 83 Under the Underwood law of 1913 the amounts were disturbed by war conditions varying 6 percent to 14 . 8 percent . The proportion of imports which will be free of duty under the new law is estimated at from 61 to 63 percent . This compares with averages under The McKinley law of 52 . 4 The Wilson law of 49 . 4 The Dingley law of 45 . 2 The Payne Aldrich law of 52 . 5 The Fordney McCumber law of 63 . 8 Under the Underwood law of 1913 disturbed conditions varied the free list from 60 percent to 73 percent averaging 66 . 3 percent . The increases in tariff are largely directed to the interest of the farmer . Of the increases , it is stated by the Tariff Commission that 93 . 73 percent are upon products of agricultural origin measured in value , as distinguished from 6 . 25 percent upon commodities of strictly nonagricultural origin . The average rate upon agricultural raw materials shows an increase from 38 . 10 percent to 48 . 92 percent in contrast to dutiable articles of strictly other than agricultural origin which show an average increase of from 31 . 02 percent to 34 . 31 percent . Compensatory duties have necessarily been given on products manufactured from agricultural raw materials and protective rates added to these in some instances . The extent of rate revision as indicated by the Tariff Commission is that in value of the total imports the duties upon approximately 22 . 5 percent have been increased , and 77 . 5 percent were untouched or decreased . By number of the dutiable items mentioned in the bill , out of the total of about 3 , 300 , there were about 890 increased , 235 decreased , and 2 , 170 untouched . The number of items increased was , therefore , 27 percent of all dutiable items , and compares with 83 percent of the number of items which were increased in the 1922 revision . This tariff law is like all other tariff legislation , whether framed primarily . upon a protective or a revenue basis . It contains many compromises between sectional interests and between different industries . No tariff bill has ever been enacted or ever will be enacted under the present system that will be perfect . A large portion of the items are always adjusted with good judgment , but it is bound to contain some inequalities and inequitable compromises . There are items upon which duties will prove too high and others upon which duties will prove to be too low . Certainly no President , with his other duties , can pretend to make that exhaustive determination of the complex facts which surround each of those 3 , 300 items , and which has required the attention of hundreds of men in Congress for nearly a year and a third . That responsibility must rest upon the Congress in a legislative rate revision . On the administrative side I have insisted , however , that there should be created a new basis for the flexible tariff and it has been incorporated in this law . Thereby the means are established for objective and judicial review of these rates upon principles laid down by the Congress , free from pressures inherent in legislative action . Thus , the outstanding step of this tariff legislation has been the reorganization of the largely inoperative flexible provision of 1922 into a form which should render it possible to secure prompt and scientific adjustment of serious inequities and inequalities which may prove to have been incorporated in the bill . This new provision has even a larger importance . If a perfect tariff bill were enacted today , the increased rapidity of economic change and the constant shifting of our relations to industries abroad will create a continuous stream of items which would work hardship upon some segment of the American people except for the provision of this relief . Without a workable flexible provision we would require even more frequent congressional tariff revision than during the past . With it the country should be freed from further general revision for many years to come . Congressional revisions are not only disturbing to business but with all their necessary collateral surroundings in lobbies , log rolling , and the activities of group interests , are disturbing to public confidence . Under the old flexible provisions , the task of adjustment was imposed directly upon the President , and the limitations in the law which circumscribed it were such that action was long delayed and it was largely inoperative , although important benefits were brought to the dairying , flax , glass , and other industries through it . The new flexible provision established the responsibility for revisions upon a reorganized Tariff Commission , composed of members equal of both parties as a definite rate making body acting through semi judicial methods of open hearings and investigation by which items can be taken up one by one upon direction or upon application of aggrieved parties . Recommendations are to be made to the President , he being given authority to promulgate or veto the conclusions of the Commission . Such revision can be accomplished without disturbance to business , as they concern but one item at a time , and the principles laid down assure a protective basis . The principle of a protective tariff for the benefit of labor , industry , and the farmer is established in the bill by the requirement that the Commission shall adjust the rates so as to cover the differences in cost of production at home and abroad , and it is authorized to increase or decrease the duties by 50 percent to effect this end . The means and methods of ascertaining such differences by the Commission are provided in such fashion as should expedite prompt and effective action if grievances develop . When the flexible principle was first written into law in 1922 , by tradition and force of habit the old conception of legislative revision was so firmly fixed that the innovation was bound to be used with caution and in a restricted field , even had it not been largely inoperative for other reasons . Now , however , and particularly after the record of the last 15 months , there is a growing and widespread realization that in this highly complicated and intricately organized and rapidly shifting modern economic world , the time has come when a more scientific and businesslike method of tariff revision must be devised . Toward this the new flexible provision takes a long step . These provisions meet the repeated demands of statesmen and industrial and agricultural leaders over the past 25 years . It complies in full degree with the proposals made 20 years ago by President Roosevelt . It now covers proposals which I urged in 1922 . If , however , by any chance the flexible provisions now made should prove insufficient for effective action , I shall ask for further authority for the Commission , for I believe that public opinion will give wholehearted support to the carrying out of such a program on a generous scale to the end that we may develop a protective system free from the vices which have characterized every tariff revision in the past . The complaints from some foreign countries that these duties have been placed unduly high can be remedied , if justified , by proper application to the Tariff Commission . It is urgent that the uncertainties in the business world which have been added to by the long extended debate of the measure should be ended . They can be ended only by completion of this bill . Meritorious demands for further protection to agriculture and labor which have developed since the tariff of 1922 would not end if this bill fails of enactment . Agitation for legislative tariff revision would necessarily continue before the country . Nothing would contribute to retard business recovery more than this continued agitation . As I have said , I do not assume the rate structure in this or any other tariff bill is perfect , but I am convinced that the disposal of the whole question is urgent . I believe that the flexible provisions can within reasonable time remedy inequalities that this provision is a progressive advance and gives great hope of taking the tariff away from politics , lobbying , and log rolling that the bill gives protection to agriculture for the market of its products and to several industries in need of such protection for the wage of their labor that with returning normal conditions our foreign trade will continue to expand .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives In accord with my constitutional duty , I transmit herewith to the Congress information upon the state of the Union together with recommendation of measures for its consideration . Our country is at peace . Our national defense has been maintained at a high state of effectiveness . All of the executive departments of the Government have been conducted during the year with a high devotion to public interest . There has been a far larger degree of freedom from industrial conflict than hitherto known . Education and science have made further advances . The public health is to day at its highest known level . While we have recently engaged in the aggressive contest of a national election , its very tranquillity and the acceptance of its results furnish abundant proof of the strength of our institutions . In the face of widespread hardship our people have demonstrated daily a magnificent sense of humanity , of individual and community responsibility for the welfare of the less fortunate . They have grown in their conceptions and organization for cooperative action for the common welfare . In the provision against distress during this winter , the great private agencies of the country have been mobilized again the generosity of our people has again come into evidence to a degree in which all America may take great pride . Likewise the local authorities and the States are engaged everywhere in supplemental measures of relief . The provisions made for loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , to States that have exhausted their own resources , guarantee that there should be no hunger or suffering from cold in the country . The large majority of States are showing a sturdy cooperation in the spirit of the Federal aid . The Surgeon General , in charge of the Public Health Service , furnishes me with the following information upon the state of public health MORTALITY RATE PER 1 , 000 OF POPULATION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FROM REPRESENTATIVE STATES General Infant First 9 months of 1928 11 . 9 67 . 8 1929 12 . 0 65 . 8 1930 11 . 4 62 . 0 1931 11 . 2 60 . 0 1932 10 . 6 55 . 0 The sickness rates from data available show the same trends . These facts indicate the fine endeavor of the agencies which have been mobilized for care of those in distress . ECONOMIC SITUATION The unparalleled world wide economic depression has continued through the year . Due to the European collapse , the situation developed during last fall and winter into a series of most acute crises . The unprecedented emergency measures enacted and policies adopted undoubtedly saved the country from economic disaster . After serving to defend the national security , these measures began in July to show their weight and influence toward improvement of conditions in many parts of the country . The following tables of current business indicators show the general economic movement during the past eleven months . MONTHLY BUSINESS INDICES WITH SEASONAL VARIATIONS ELIMINATED Monthly average 1923 1925 100 Industrial Factory Freight Depart Exports , Imports , Building Industrial Year and produc employ car ment store value value contracts , electric month tion ment loadings sales , all types power value consumption 1931 December 74 69 . 4 69 81 46 48 38 89 . 1 1932 January 72 68 . 1 64 78 39 42 31 93 . 9 February 69 67 . 8 62 78 45 41 27 98 . 8 March 67 66 . 4 61 72 41 37 26 88 . 0 April 63 64 . 3 59 80 38 36 27 82 . 2 May 60 62 . 1 54 73 37 34 26 82 . 0 June 59 60 . 0 52 71 34 36 27 78 . 1 July 58 58 . 3 51 67 32 27 27 79 . 2 August 60 58 . 8 51 66 31 29 30 73 . 5 September 66 60 . 3 54 70 33 32 30 84 . 0 October 66 61 . 3 57 70 33 32 29 84 . 4 The measures and policies which have procured this turn toward recovery should be continued until the depression is passed , and then the emergency agencies should be promptly liquidated . The expansion of credit facilities by the Federal Reserve System and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has been of incalculable value . The loans of the latter for reproductive works , and to railways for the creation of employment its support of the credit structure through loans to banks , insurance companies , railways , building and loan associations , and to agriculture has protected the savings and insurance policies of millions of our citizens and has relieved millions of borrowers from duress they have enabled industry and business to function and expand . The assistance given to Farm Loan Banks , the establishment of the Home Loan Banks and Agricultural Credit Associations all in their various ramifications have placed large sums of money at the disposal of the people in protection and aid . Beyond this , the extensive organization of the country in voluntary action has produced profound results . The following table indicates direct expenditures of the Federal Government in aid to unemployment , agriculture , and financial relief over the past four years . The sums applied to financial relief multiply themselves many fold , being in considerable measure the initial capital supplied to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , Farm Loan Banks , etc . , which will be recovered to the Treasury . Agricultural Public works 1 relief and financial loans Fiscal year ending June 30 1930 410 , 420 , 000 156 , 100 , 000 1931 574 , 870 , 000 196 , 700 , 000 1932 655 , 880 , 000 772 , 700 , 000 1933 717 , 260 , 000 52 , 000 , 000 Total 2 , 358 , 430 , 000 1 , 177 , 500 , 000 1 Public Building , Highways , Rivers and Harbors and their maintenance , naval and other vessels construction , hospitals , etc . Continued constructive policies promoting the economic recovery of the country must be the paramount duty of the Government . The result of the agencies we have created and the policies we have pursued has been to buttress our whole domestic financial structure and greatly to restore credit facilities . But progress in recovery requires another element as well that is fully restored confidence in the future . Institutions and men may have resources and credit but unless they have confidence progress is halting and insecure . There are three definite directions in which action by the Government at once can contribute to strengthen further the forces of recovery by strengthening of confidence . They are the necessary foundations to any other action , and their accomplishment would at once promote employment and increase prices . The first of these directions of action is the continuing reduction of all Government expenditures , whether national , State , or local . The difficulties of the country demand undiminished efforts toward economy in government in every direction . Embraced in this problem is the unquestioned balancing of the Federal Budget . That is the first necessity of national stability and is the foundation of further recovery . It must be balanced in an absolutely safe and sure manner if full confidence is to be inspired . The second direction for action is the complete reorganization at once of our banking system . The shocks to our economic life have undoubtedly been multiplied by the weakness of this system , and until they are remedied recovery will be greatly hampered . The third direction for immediate action is vigorous and whole souled cooperation with other governments in the economic field . That our major difficulties find their origins in the economic weakness of foreign nations requires no demonstration . The first need to day is strengthening of commodity prices . That can not be permanently accomplished by artificialities . It must be accomplished by expansion in consumption of goods through the return of stability and confidence in the world at large and that in turn can not be fully accomplished without cooperation with other nations . BALANCING THE BUDGET I shall in due course present the Executive Budget to the Congress . It will show proposed reductions in appropriations below those enacted by the last session of the Congress by over 830 , 000 , 000 . In addition I shall present the necessary Executive orders under the recent act authorizing the reorganization of the Federal Government which , if permitted to go into force , will produce still further substantial economies . These sums in reduction of appropriations will , however , be partially offset by an increase of about 250 , 000 , 000 in uncontrollable items such as increased debt services , etc . In the Budget there is included only the completion of the Federal public works projects already undertaken or under contract . Speeding up of Federal public works during the past four years as an aid to employment has advanced many types of such improvements to the point where further expansion can not be justified in their usefulness to the Government or the people . As an aid to unemployment we should beyond the normal constructive programs substitute reproductive or so called self liquidating works . Loans for such purposes have been provided for through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . This change in character of projects directly relieves the taxpayer and is capable of expansion into a larger field than the direct Federal works . The reproductive works constitute an addition to national wealth and to future employment , whereas further undue expansion of Federal public works is but a burden upon the future . The Federal construction program thus limited to commitments and work in progress under the proposed appropriations contemplates expenditures for the next fiscal year , including naval and other vessel construction , as well as other forms of public works and maintenance , of a total of 442 , 769 , 000 , as compared with 717 , 262 , 000 for the present year . The expenditure on such items over the four years ending June 30 next will amount to 2 , 350 , 000 , 000 , or an amount of construction work eight times as great as the cost of the Panama Canal and , except for completion of certain long view projects , places the Nation in many directions well ahead of its requirements for some years to come . A normal program of about 200 , 000 , 000 per annum should hereafter provide for the country s necessities and will permit substantial future reduction in Federal expenditures . I recommend that the furlough system installed last year be continued not only because of the economy produced but because , being tantamount to the 5 day week , it sets an example which should be followed by the country and because it embraces within its workings the spread work principle and thus serves to maintain a number of public servants who would otherwise be deprived of all income . I feel , however , in view of the present economic situation and the decrease in the cost of living by over 20 per cent , that some further sacrifice should be made by salaried officials of the Government over and above the 8 1 3 per cent reduction under the furlough system . I will recommend that after exempting the first 1 , 000 of salary there should be a temporary reduction for one year of 11 per cent of that part of all Government salaries in excess of the 1 , 000 exemption , the result of which , combined with the furlough system , will average about 14 . 8 per cent reduction in pay to those earning more than 1 , 000 . I will recommend measures to eliminate certain payments in the veterans services . I conceive these outlays were entirely beyond the original intentions of Congress in building up veterans allowances . Many abuses have grown up from ill considered legislation . They should be eliminated . The Nation should not ask for a reduction in allowances to men and dependents whose disabilities rise out of war service nor to those veterans with substantial service who have become totally disabled from non war connected causes and who are at the same time without other support . These latter veterans are a charge on the community at some point , and I feel that in view of their service to the Nation as a whole the responsibility should fall upon the Federal Government . Many of the economies recommended in the Budget were presented at the last session of the Congress but failed of adoption . If the Economy and Appropriations Committees of the Congress in canvassing these proposed expenditures shall find further reductions which can be made without impairing essential Government services , it will be welcomed both by the country and by myself . But under no circumstances do I feel that the Congress should fail to uphold the total of reductions recommended . Some of the older revenues and some of the revenues provided under the act passed during the last session of the Congress , particularly those generally referred to as the nuisance taxes , have not been as prolific of income as had been hoped . Further revenue is necessary in addition to the amount of reductions in expenditures recommended . Many of the manufacturers excise taxes upon selected industries not only failed to produce satisfactory revenue , but they are in many ways unjust and discriminatory . The time has come when , if the Government is to have an adequate basis of revenue to assure a balanced Budget , this system of special manufacturers excise taxes should be extended to cover practically all manufactures at a uniform rate , except necessary food and possibly some grades of clothing . At the last session the Congress responded to my request for authority to reorganize the Government departments . The act provides for the grouping and consolidation of executive and administrative agencies according to major purpose , and thereby reducing the number and overlap and duplication of effort . Executive orders issued for these purposes are required to be transmitted to the Congress while in session and do not become effective until after the expiration of 60 calendar days after such transmission , unless the Congress shall sooner approve . I shall issue such Executive orders within a few days grouping or consolidating over fifty executive and administrative agencies including a large number of commissions and independent agencies . The second step , of course , remains that after these various bureaus and agencies are placed cheek by jowl into such groups , the administrative officers in charge of the groups shall eliminate their overlap and still further consolidate these activities . Therein lie large economies . The Congress must be warned that a host of interested persons inside and outside the Government whose vision is concentrated on some particular function will at once protest against these proposals . These same sorts of activities have prevented reorganization of the Government for over a quarter of a century . They must be disregarded if the task is to be accomplished . BANKING The basis of every other and every further effort toward recovery is to reorganize at once our banking system . The shocks to our economic system have undoubtedly multiplied by the weakness of our financial system . I first called attention of the Congress in 1929 to this condition , and I have unceasingly recommended remedy since that time . The subject has been exhaustively investigated both by the committees of the Congress and the officers of the Federal Reserve System . The banking and financial system is presumed to serve in furnishing the essential lubricant to the wheels of industry , agriculture , and commerce , that is , credit . Its diversion from proper use , its improper use , or its insufficiency instantly brings hardship and dislocation in economic life . As a system our banking has failed to meet this great emergency . It can be said without question of doubt that our losses and distress have been greatly augmented by its wholly inadequate organization . Its inability as a system to respond to our needs is to day a constant drain upon progress toward recovery . In this statement I am not referring to individual banks or bankers . Thousands of them have shown distinguished courage and ability . On the contrary , I am referring to the system itself , which is so organized , or so lacking in organization , that in an emergency its very mechanism jeopardizes or paralyzes the action of sound banks and its instability is responsible for periodic dangers to our whole economic system . Bank failures rose in 1931 to 10 1 2 per cent of all the banks as compared to 1 1 2 per cent of the failures of all other types of enterprise . Since January 1 , 1930 , we have had 4 , 665 banks suspend , with 3 , 300 , 000 , 000 in deposits . Partly from fears and drains from abroad , partly from these failures themselves which indeed often caused closing of sound banks , we have witnessed hoarding of currency to an enormous sum , rising during the height of the crisis to over 1 , 600 , 000 , 000 . The results from interreaction of cause and effect have expressed themselves in strangulation of credit which at times has almost stifled the Nation s business and agriculture . The losses , suffering , and tragedies of our people are incalculable . Not alone do they lie in the losses of savings to millions of homes , injury by deprival of working capital to thousands of small businesses , but also , in the frantic pressure to recall loans to meet pressures of hoarding and in liquidation of failed banks , millions of other people have suffered in the loss of their homes and farms , businesses have been ruined , unemployment increased , and farmers prices diminished . That this failure to function is unnecessary and is the fault of our particular system is plainly indicated by the fact that in Great Britain , where the economic mechanism has suffered far greater shocks than our own , there has not been a single bank failure during the depression . Again in Canada , where the situation has been in large degree identical with our own , there have not been substantial bank failures . The creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the amendments to the Federal Reserve Act served to defend the Nation in a great crisis . They are not remedies they are relief . It is inconceivable that the Reconstruction Corporation , which has extended aid to nearly 6 , 000 institutions and is manifestly but a temporary device , can go on indefinitely . It is to day a matter of satisfaction that the rate of bank failures , of hoarding , and the demands upon the Reconstruction Corporation have greatly lessened . The acute phases of the crisis have obviously passed and the time has now come when this national danger and this failure to respond to national necessities must be ended and the measures to end them can be safely undertaken . Methods of reform have been exhaustively examined . There is no reason now why solution should not be found at the present session of the Congress . Inflation of currency or governmental conduct of banking can have no part in these reforms . The Government must abide within the field of constructive organization , regulation , and the enforcement of safe practices only . Parallel with reform in the banking laws must be changes in the Federal Farm Loan Banking system and in the Joint Stock Land Banks . Some of these changes should be directed to permanent improvement and some to emergency aid to our people where they wish to fight to save their farms and homes . I wish again to emphasize this view that these widespread banking reforms are a national necessity and are the first requisites for further recovery in agriculture and business . They should have immediate consideration as steps greatly needed to further recovery . ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH OTHER NATIONS Our major difficulties during the past two years find their origins in the shocks from economic collapse abroad which in turn are the aftermath of the Great War . If we are to secure rapid and assured recovery and protection for the future we must cooperate with foreign nations in many measures . We have actively engaged in a World Disarmament Conference where , with success , we should reduce our own tax burdens and the tax burdens of other major nations . We should increase political stability of the world . We should lessen the danger of war by increasing defensive powers and decreasing offensive powers of nations . We would thus open new vistas of economic expansion for the world . We are participating in the formulation of a World Economic Conference , successful results from which would contribute much to advance in agricultural prices , employment , and business . Currency depreciation and correlated forces have contributed greatly to decrease in price levels . Moreover , from these origins rise most of the destructive trade barriers now stifling the commerce of the world . We could by successful action increase security and expand trade through stability in international exchange and monetary values . By such action world confidence could be restored . It would bring courage and stability , which will reflect into every home in our land . The European governments , obligated to us in war debts , have requested that there should be suspension of payments due the United States on December 15 next , to be accompanied by exchange of views upon this debt question . Our Government has informed them that we do not approve of suspension of the December 15 payments . I have stated that I would recommend to the Congress methods to overcome temporary exchange difficulties in connection with this payment from nations where it may be necessary . In the meantime I wish to reiterate that here are three great fields of international action which must be considered not in part but as a whole . They are of most vital interest to our people . Within them there are not only grave dangers if we fail in right action but there also tie immense opportunities for good if we shall succeed . Within success there lie major remedies for our economic distress and major progress in stability and security to every fireside in our country . The welfare of our people is dependent upon successful issue of the great causes of world peace , world disarmament , and organized world recovery . Nor is it too much to say that to day as never before the welfare of mankind and the preservation of civilization depend upon our solution of these questions . Such solutions can not be attained except by honest friendship , by adherence to agreements entered upon until mutually revised and by cooperation amongst nations in a determination to find solutions which will be mutually beneficial . OTHER LEGISLATION I have placed various legislative needs before the Congress in previous messages , and these views require no amplification on this occasion . I have urged the need for reform in our transportation and power regulation , in the antitrust laws as applied to our national resource industries , western range conservation , extension of Federal aid to child health services , membership in the World Court , the ratification of the Great Lakes Lawrence Seaway Treaty , revision of the bankruptcy acts , revision of Federal court procedure , and many other pressing problems . These and other special subjects I shall where necessary deal with by special communications to the Congress . The activities of our Government are so great , when combined with the emergency activities which have arisen out of the world crisis , that even the briefest review of them would render the annual message unduly long . I shall therefore avail myself of the fact that every detail of the Government is covered in the reports to the Congress by each of the departments and agencies of the Government . CONCLUSION It seems to me appropriate upon this occasion to make certain general observations upon the principles which must dominate the solution of problems now pressing upon the Nation . Legislation in response to national needs will be effective only if every such act conforms to a complete philosophy of the people s purposes and destiny . Ours is a distinctive government with a unique history and background , consciously dedicated to specific ideals of liberty and to a faith in the inviolable sanctity of the individual human spirit . Furthermore , the continued existence and adequate functioning of our government in preservation of ordered liberty and stimulation of progress depends upon the maintenance of State , local , institutional , and individual sense of responsibility . We have builded a system of individualism peculiarly our own which must not be forgotten in any governmental acts , for from it have grown greater accomplishments than those of any other nation . On the social and economic sides , the background of our American system and the motivation of progress is essentially that we should allow free play of social and economic forces as far as will not limit equality of opportunity and as will at the same time stimulate the initiative and enterprise of our people . In the maintenance of this balance the Federal Government can permit of no privilege to any person or group . It should act as a regulatory agent and not as a participant in economic and social life . The moment the Government participates , it becomes a competitor with the people . As a competitor it becomes at once a tyranny in whatever direction it may touch . We have around us numerous such experiences , no one of which can be found to have justified itself except in cases where the people as a whole have met forces beyond their control , such as those of the Great War and this great depression , where the full powers of the Federal Government must be exerted to protect the people . But even these must be limited to an emergency sense and must be promptly ended when these dangers are overcome . With the free development of science and the consequent multitude of inventions , some of which are absolutely revolutionary in our national life , the Government must not only stimulate the social and economic responsibility of individuals and private institutions but it must also give leadership to cooperative action amongst the people which will soften the effect of these revolutions and thus secure social transformations in an orderly manner . The highest form of self government is the voluntary cooperation within our people for such purposes . But I would emphasize again that social and economic solutions , as such , will not avail to satisfy the aspirations of the people unless they conform with the traditions of our race deeply grooved in their sentiments through a century and a half of struggle for ideals of life that are rooted in religion and fed from purely spiritual springs .<speech_sep>I have been asked by two of your members to discuss something of the British demonetization or departure from the gold standard . I can only do that by way of background . I cannot make a public statement in the matter . I think you will understand that this situation has been pending for a good many months . There has been a large amount of British investment in the United States , and that amount , estimated by the Department of Commerce , aggregates something over 1 , 500 million . That is not flight of capital but steadily increasing expenditures here which naturally affects the exchanges . It has taken place not only in the past few months but for some years back . That , of course , has affected the problem of exchange . There has been some piling up of immediate cash in our banks from that quarter . The course resolved upon by the British Government creates some temporary dislocations in the international world , but they are due more to the confusion arising out of readjustment of quotations and values than in their effect on the values of either securities or commodities . The first effect of the decrease in the gold value of the pound is a rise in prices of commodities in Great Britain , at least in all international commodities where the price is made by international action , such as in wheat and other raw materials . There is involved a large amount of transaction based on the readjustment of those prices . A certain amount of confusion comes out of that , and the effect on our commodity markets has been a decrease in prices . There has been a rise in price in England in consequence and our prices are practically unchanged yesterday and today . The fact that the pound is taken off its fixed value of 4 . 86 is not the abandonment of the gold standard even for the pound as international commerce revolves in these days all transactions will be measured in some gold value , whether in dollars , francs , gulden , or any other of the fixed gold currencies . No transaction can take place unless it has some basis of measurement of that character . It really means that the fixed gold standard has been abandoned and a variable standard adopted which may change momentarily . But in any event all values in international commerce are bound to revolve on gold values or some measuring stick in gold . It is more or less a case of abandoning a fixed standard and adopting a variable one so far as international commerce is concerned . The effect in England will undoubtedly be to increase exports , which amounts to price reduction compared with the standard of measurement in gold , and it should act as a stimulant and thus should increase employment and increase the demand again for raw materials . Obviously , it amounts to a reduction in standards of living temporarily in those commodities which are imported , of course raw materials , but wages and rank will lag behind . Production costs will be lower , and consequently , exports will be stimulated . The tendency also may be to decrease imports to some extent especially for highly competitive goods . On the export side , the effect is not going to be very material on the United States because there are comparatively small volume of British and American goods which are highly competitive in neutral markets . A study made some time ago of the Argentine showed that there were only about 10 percent of the exports of the United States to the Argentine and correspondingly 10 percent of the British exports to the Argentine that were competitive . We are exporting goods which we can peculiarly produce to the best advantage , and it might mean competition in respect to that small fraction over toward the neutral market . But it would not be any appreciable volume . There might be some decrease in imports into Great Britain , especially in luxuries , but our trade with Great Britain consists largely of raw materials and manufactured goods . If there is stimulation of British exports our exports would be more likely to increase than decrease . I mention that only to indicate that the effect of it is not as far reaching as some people may think . On the financial side there are no consequential balances of American banks in England . They will always have sufficient of their own capital . So there are no losses there of any consequence at all . All together the action , no doubt necessary on the British side , is not , we feel , going to have any great effect in the United States . The probabilities are that it will considerably improve the situation in England , and we will benefit in the long run . In any event , when there is a question pending over the world s economic life , the actual realization of it is much less severe on us than is the constant possibility of it such as has been the case for the past 3 or 4 months . All together if we are going to have an important economic shift it is better to have it over than to have it hanging about . You will realize also that this is not the first time that the pound has been off the gold basis . I do not know of any nation in the world which manages to maintain through its national life the gold value of its currency . There was a long period in the United States after the Civil War when we certainly could not maintain it . The pound was off the gold basis from some point in the war to 3 , 4 , or 5 years afterwards , but gradually the economic situation readjusts itself . These things are temporary and go back again to their original position . And that is all I have today .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives I return herewith , without my approval , 17054 , An Act to increase the loan basis of adjusted service certificates . In order that it may be clearly understood , I may review that the adjusted compensation act bonus bill passed on May 19 , 1924 , awarded to 3 , 498 , 000 veterans approximately 1 , 365 , 000 , 000 further compensation for war service . To this sum was added 25 per cent , said to be consideration for deferring the payment until about 1945 , the whole bearing 4 per cent compound interest . Immediate payment to dependents upon death was included , thus creating an endowment insurance policy represented by a certificate to each veteran showing the sum payable at the end of the period the face value . The total face value of the outstanding certificates to day after paying the sums due of less than 50 and payments in full to dependents is 3 , 426 , 000 , 000 held by 3 , 397 , 000 veterans or an average of about 1 , 000 each . The burden upon the country was to be an amount each year sufficient as a yearly premium to provide for the payment of the face value of these certificates in about 1945 , and to date has involved an appropriation averaging 112 , 000 , 000 per annum . The accumulation of these appropriations is represented by Government obligations deposited in a reserve fund , which fund now amounts to about 750 , 000 , 000 . A loan basis to certificate holders was established equal to 90 per cent of the reserve value of the certificates , such loans now in the sixth year being authorized to 221 2 per cent of the face value . When the bonus act was passed it was upon the explicit understanding of the Congress that the matter was closed and the Government would not be called upon to make subsequent enlargements . It is now proposed to enlarge the loan rate to 50 per cent of the face value , at a low rate of interest , thus imposing a potential cash outlay upon the Government of about 1 , 700 , 000 , 000 , if all veterans apply for loans , less about 330 , 000 , 000 already loaned . According to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs the probable number who will avail themselves of the privilege under this bill will require approximately 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 . There not being a penny in the Treasury to meet such a demand , the Government must borrow this sum through the sale of the reserve fund securities together with further issues or we must need impose further taxation . The sole appeal made for the reopening of the bonus act is the claim that funds from the National Treasury should be provided to veterans in distress as the result of the drought and business depression . There are veterans unemployed and in need to day in common with many others of our people . These , like the others , are being provided the basic necessities of life by the devoted committees in those parts of the country affected by the depression or drought . The governments and many employers are giving preference to veterans in employment . Their welfare is and should be a matter of concern to our people . Inquiry indicates that such care is being given throughout the country , and it also indicates that the number of veterans in need of such relief is a minor percentage of the whole . The utility of this legislation as relief to those in distress is far less than has been disclosed . The popular assumption has been that as the certificates average 1 , 000 then each veteran can obtain 500 by way of a loan . But this is only an average , and more than one half will receive less than this amount . In fact over 800 , 000 men will be able to borrow less than 200 , and of these over 200 , 000 will be able to borrow only an average of 75 . Furthermore , there are 100 , 000 veterans whose certificates have been issued recently who under the proposed law will have no loan privilege until their certificates are two years old . It is therefore urgent in any event that local committees continue relief to veterans , but this legislation would lead such local committees and employers to assume that these veterans have been provided for by the Federal Treasury , and thereby threatens them with greater hardships than before . The breach of fundamental principle in this proposal is the requirement of the Federal Government to provide an enormous sum of money to a vast majority who are able to care for themselves and who are caring for themselves . Among those who would receive the proposed benefits are included 387 , 000 veterans and 400 , 000 dependents , who are already receiving some degree of allowance or support from the Federal Government . But in addition to these , it provides equal benefits for scores of thousands of others who are in the income tax paying class , and for scores of thousands who are holding secure positions in the Federal , State , and local governments and in every profession and industry . I know that most of these men do not seek these privileges , they have no desire to be presented to the American people as benefitting by a burden put upon the whole people , and I have many manifestations from veterans on whom the times are bearing hardly that they do not want to be represented to our people as a group substituting special privilege for the idealism and patriotism they have rejoiced in offering to their country through their service . It is suggested as a reason for making these provisions applicable to all veterans , that we should not make public distinction between veterans in need and the others who comprise the vast majority lest we characterize those deserving help as a pauper class . On the contrary , veterans in need are and should be a preferred class , that a grateful country would be proud to honor with its support . Adoption of the principle of aid to the rich or to those able to support themselves in itself sets up a group of special privilege among our citizens . The principle that the Nation should give generous care to those veterans who are ill , disabled , in need or in distress , even though these disabilities do not arise from the war , has been fully accepted by the Nation . Pensions or allowances have been provided for the dependents of those who lost their lives in the war allowances have been provided to those who suffered disabilities from the war additional allowances were passed at the last session of Congress to all the veterans whose earning power at any time may be permanently impaired by injury or illness free hospitalization is available not only to those suffering from the results of war but to large numbers of temporarily ill . Together with war risk insurance and the adjusted compensation , these services now total an annual expenditure of approximately 600 , 000 , 000 and under existing laws will increase to 800 , 000 , 000 per annum in a very few years for World War veterans alone . A total of five thousand millions of dollars has been expended upon such services since the war . Our country has thus shown its sense of obligation and generosity , and its readiness at all times to aid those of its veterans in need . I have the utmost confidence that our service men would be amongst the first to oppose a policy of Government assistance to veterans who have property and means to support themselves , for service men are as devoted to the welfare of our country in peace as in war and as clearly foresee the future dangers of embarking on such a policy . It could but create resentments which would ultimately react against those who should be given care . It is argued that the distribution of the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed by this bill would stimulate business generally . We can not further the restoration of prosperity by borrowing from some of our people , pledging the credit of all of the people , to loan to some of our people who are not in need of the money . If the exercise of these rights were limited to expenditure upon necessities only , there would be no stimulation to business . The theory of stimulation is based upon the anticipation of wasteful expenditure . It can be of no assistance in the return of real prosperity . If this argument of proponents is correct , we should make Government loans to the whole people . It is represented that this measure merely provides loans against a future obligation and that , therefore , it will cost the American people nothing . That is an incomplete statement . A cost at once arises to the people when instead of proceeding by annual appropriation the Government is forced to secure a huge sum by borrowing or otherwise , especially in the circumstances of to day when we are compelled in the midst of depression to make other large borrowings to cover deficits and refunding operations . An increased rate of interest which the Government must pay upon all long term issues is inevitable . It imposes an additional burden of interest on the people which will extend through the whole term of such loans . Some cost arises to the people through the tendency to increase the interest rates which every State and municipality must pay in their borrowing for public works and improvements , as well as the rate which industry and business must pay . There is a cost to someone through the retardation of the speed of recovery of employment when Government borrowings divert the savings of the people from their use by constructive industry and commerce . It imposes a great charge upon the individual who loses such increased employment or continues unemployed . To the veteran this is a double loss when he has consumed the value of his certificate and has also lost the opportunity for greater earnings . There is a greater cost than all this It is a step toward Government aid to those who can help themselves . These direct or indirect burdens fall upon the people as a whole . The need of our people to day is a decrease in the burden of taxes and unemployment , yet they who include the veterans are being steadily forced toward higher tax levels and lessened employment by such acts as this . We must not forget the millions of hard working families in our country who are striving to pay the debts which they have incurred in acquiring homes and farms in endeavor to build protection for their future . They , in the last analysis , must bear the burden of increasing Government aid and taxes . It is not the rich who suffer . When we take employment and taxes from our people it is the poor who suffer . There is a very serious phase of this matter for the wives and children of veterans and to the future security of veterans themselves . Each of these certificates is an endowment insurance policy . Any moneys advanced against them , together with its interest , will be automatically deducted from the value of the certificates in case of death or upon maturity . No one will deny that under the pressures or allurements of the moment , many will borrow against these certificates for other than absolutely necessary purposes . The loss to many families means the destruction of the one safeguard at their most critical time . It can not be contended that the interests of the families of our country are conserved by either cashing or borrowing upon their life insurance policies . I have no desire to present monetary aspects of the question except so far as they affect the human aspects . Surely it is a human aspect to transfer to the backs of those who toil , including veterans , a burden of those who by position and property can care for themselves . It is a human aspect to incur the danger of continued or increased unemployment . It is a human aspect to deprive women and children of protection by reckless use of an endowment policy . Our country is rich enough to do any justice . No country is rich enough to do an injustice . The patriotism of our people is not a material thing . It is a spiritual thing . We can not pay for it with Government aid . We can honor those in need by our aid . And it is a fundamental aspect of freedom among us that no step should be taken which burdens the Nation with a privileged class who can care for themselves . I regard the bill under consideration as unwise from the standpoint of the veterans themselves , and unwise from the standpoint of the welfare of all the people . The future of our World War veterans is inseparably bound up with the future of the whole people . The greatest service that we can render both veterans and the public generally is to administer the affairs of our Government with a view to the well being and happiness of all of the Nation . The matter under consideration is of grave importance in itself but of much graver importance is the whole tendency to open the Federal Treasury to a thousand purposes , many admirable in their intentions but in which the proponents fail or do not care to see that with such beginnings many of them insidiously consume more and more of the savings and the labor of our people . In aggregate they threaten burdens beyond the ability of our country normally to bear and , of far higher importance , each of them breaks the barriers of self reliance and self support in our people .<speech_sep>The fundamental business of the country , that is the production and distribution of commodities , is on a sound and prosperous basis . The best evidence is that although production and consumption are at high levels , the average prices of commodities as a whole have not increased and there have been no appreciable increases in the stocks of manufactured goods . Moreover , there has been a tendency of wages to increase , the output per worker in many industries again shows an increase , all of which indicates a healthy condition . The construction and building material industries have been to some extent affected by the high interest rates induced by stock speculation and there has been some seasonal decrease in one or two other industries but these movements are of secondary character when considered in the whole situation . A temporary drop in grain prices sympathetically with stock exchange prices usually happens but as the Department of Agriculture points out , the overriding fact in grain is that this year s world wheat harvest is estimated to be 500 million bushels less than that of last year , which will result in a very low carryover at the end of the harvest year .<speech_sep>
