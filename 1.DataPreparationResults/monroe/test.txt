Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Many important subjects will claim your attention during the present session , of which I shall endeavor to give , in aid of your deliberations , a just idea in this communication . I undertake this duty with diffidence , from the vast extent of the interests on which I have to treat and of their great importance to every portion of our Union . I enter on it with zeal from a thorough conviction that there never was a period since the establishment of our Revolution when , regarding the condition of the civilized world and its bearing on us , there was greater necessity for devotion in the public servants to their respective duties , or for virtue , patriotism , and union in our constituents . Meeting in you a new Congress , I deem it proper to present this view of public affairs in greater detail than might otherwise be necessary . I do it , however , with peculiar satisfaction , from a knowledge that in this respect I shall comply more fully with the sound principles of our Government . The people being with us exclusively the sovereign , it is indispensable that full information be laid before them on all important subjects , to enable them to exercise that high power with complete effect . If kept in the dark , they must be incompetent to it . We are all liable to error , and those who are engaged in the management of public affairs are more subject to excitement and to be led astray by their particular interests and passions than the great body of our constituents , who , living at home in the pursuit of their ordinary avocations , are calm but deeply interested spectators of events and of the conduct of those who are parties to them . To the people every department of the Government and every individual in each are responsible , and the more full their information the better they can judge of the wisdom of the policy pursued and of the conduct of each in regard to it . From their dispassionate judgment much aid may always be obtained , while their approbation will form the greatest incentive and most gratifying reward for virtuous actions , and the dread of their censure the best security against the abuse of their confidence . Their interests in all vital questions are the same , and the bond , by sentiment as well as by interest , will be proportionably strengthened as they are better informed of the real state of public affairs , especially in difficult conjunctures . It is by such knowledge that local prejudices and jealousies are surmounted , and that a national policy extending its fostering care and protection to all the great interests of our Union , is formed and steadily adhered to . A precise knowledge of our relations with foreign powers as respects our negotiations and transactions with each is thought to be particularly necessary . Equally necessary is it that we should for a just estimate of our resources , revenue , and progress in every kind of improvement connected with the national prosperity and public defense . It is by rendering justice to other nations that we may expect it from them . It is by our ability to resent injuries and redress wrongs that we may avoid them . The commissioners under the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent , having disagreed in their opinions respecting that portion of the boundary between the Territories of the United States and of Great Britain the establishment of which had been submitted to them , have made their respective reports in compliance with that article , that the same might be referred to the decision of a friendly power . It being manifest , however , that it would be difficult , if not impossible , for any power to perform that office without great delay and much inconvenience to itself , a proposal has been made by this Government , and acceded to by that of Great Britain , to endeavor to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation . It appearing from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be formed of the commercial intercourse between the United States and the British colonies in this hemisphere by legislative acts while each party pursued its own course without agreement or concert with the other , a proposal has been made to the British Government to regulate this commerce by treaty , as it has been to arrange in like manner the just claim of the citizens of the United States inhabiting the States and Territories bordering on the lakes and rivers which empty into the Lawrence to the navigation of that river to the ocean . For these and other objects of high importance to the interests of both parties a negotiation has been opened with the British Government which it is hoped will have a satisfactory result . The commissioners under the 6th and 7th articles of the treaty of Ghent having successfully closed their labors in relation to the 6th , have proceeded to the discharge of those relating to the 7th . Their progress in the extensive survey required for the performance of their duties justifies the presumption that it will be completed in the ensuing year . The negotiation which had been long depending with the French Government on several important subjects , and particularly for a just indemnity for losses sustained in the late wars by the citizens of the United States under unjustifiable seizures and confiscations of their property , has not as yet had the desired effect . As this claim rests on the same principle with others which have been admitted by the French Government , it is not perceived on what just ground it can be rejected . A minister will be immediately appointed to proceed to France and resume the negotiation on this and other subjects which may arise between the two nations . At the proposal of the Russian Imperial Government , made through the minister of the Emperor residing here , a full power and instructions have been transmitted to the minister of the United States at Petersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and interests of the two nations on the North West coast of this continent . A similar proposal had been made by His Imperial Majesty to the Government of Great Britain , which has likewise been acceded to . The Government of the United States has been desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifesting the great value which they have invariably attached to the friendship of the Emperor and their solicitude to cultivate the best understanding with his Government . In the discussions to which this interest has given rise and in the arrangements by which they may terminate the occasion has been judged proper for asserting , as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved , that the American continents , by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain , are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers . Since the close of the last session of Congress the commissioners and arbitrators for ascertaining and determining the amount of indemnification which may be due to citizens of the United States under the decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia , in conformity to the convention concluded at Petersburg on 1822 07 12 , have assembled in this city , and organized themselves as a board for the performance of the duties assigned to them by that treaty . The commission constituted under the 11th article of the treaty of 1819 02 22 , between the United States and Spain is also in session here , and as the term of three years limited by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before the period of the next regular meeting of Congress , the attention of the Legislature will be drawn to the measures which may be necessary to accomplish the objects for which the commission was instituted . In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives adopted at their last session , instructions have been given to all the ministers of the United States accredited to the powers of Europe and America to propose the proscription of the African slave trade by classing it under the denomination , and inflicting on its perpetrators the punishment , of piracy . Should this proposal be acceded to , it is not doubted that this odious and criminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppressed . It is earnestly hoped that it will be acceded to , from the firm belief that it is the most effectual expedient that can be adopted for the purpose . At the commencement of the recent war between France and Spain it was declared by the French Government that it would grant no commissions to privateers , and that neither the commerce of Spain herself nor of neutral nations should be molested by the naval force of France , except in the breach of a lawful blockade . This declaration , which appears to have been faithfully carried into effect , concurring with principles proclaimed and cherished by the United States from the first establishment of their independence , suggested the hope that the time had arrived when the proposal for adopting it as a permanent and invariable rule in all future maritime wars might meet the favorable consideration of the great European powers . Instructions have accordingly been given to our ministers with France , Russia , and Great Britain to make those proposals to their respective Governments , and when the friends of humanity reflect on the essential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would result from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great facility by which it might be accomplished , requiring only the consent of a few sovereigns , an earnest hope is indulged that these overtures will meet with an attention animated by the spirit in which they were made , and that they will ultimately be successful . The ministers who were appointed to the Republics of Colombia and Buenos Ayres during the last session of Congress proceeded shortly afterwards to their destinations . Of their arrival there official intelligence has not yet been received . The minister appointed to the Republic of Chile will sail in a few days . An early appointment will also be made to Mexico . A minister has been received from Colombia , and the other Governments have been informed that ministers , or diplomatic agents of inferior grade , would be received from each , accordingly as they might prefer the one or the other . The minister appointed to Spain proceeded soon after his appointment for Cadiz , the residence of the Sovereign to whom he was accredited . In approaching that port the frigate which conveyed him was warned off by the commander of the French squadron by which it was blockaded and not permitted to enter , although apprised by the captain of the frigate of the public character of the person whom he had on board , the landing of whom was the sole object of his proposed entry . This act , being considered an infringement of the rights of ambassadors and of nations , will form a just cause of complaint to the Government of France against the officer by whom it was committed . The actual condition of the public finances more than realizes the favorable anticipations that were entertained of it at the opening of the last session of Congress . On the first of January there was a balance in the Treasury of 4 , 237 , 427 . 55 . From that time to the 30th of September the receipts amounted to upward of 16 . 1and the expenditures to 11 . 4During the 4th quarter of the year it is estimated that the receipts will at least equal the expenditures , and that there will remain in the Treasury on the first day of January next a surplus of nearly 9 On 1825 01 01 , a large amount of the war debt and a part of the Revolutionary debt become redeemable . Additional portions of the former will continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835 . it is believed , however , that if the United States remain at peace the whole of that debt may be redeemed by the ordinary revenue of those years during that period under the provision of the act of 1817 03 03 , creating the sinking fund , and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain after the year 1835 will be the 7M of 5 stock subscribed to the Bank of the United States , and the 3 Revolutionary debt , amounting to 13 , 296 , 099 . 06 , both of which are redeemable at the pleasure of the Government . The state of the Army in its organization and discipline has been gradually improving for several years , and has now attained a high degree of perfection . The military disbursements have been regularly made and the accounts regularly and promptly rendered for settlement . The supplies of various descriptions have been of good quality , and regularly issued at all of the posts . A system of economy and accountability has been introduced into every branch of the service which admits of little additional improvement . This desirable state has been attained by the act reorganizing the staff of the Army , passed on 1818 04 14 . The moneys appropriated for fortifications have been regularly and economically applied , and all the works advanced as rapidly as the amount appropriated would admit . Three important works will be completed in the course of this year that is , Fort Washington , Fort Delaware , and the fort at the Rigolets , in Louisiana . The Board of Engineers and the Topographical Corps have been in constant and active service in surveying the coast and projecting the works necessary for its defense . The Military Academy has attained a degree of perfection in its discipline and instruction equal , as is believed , to any institution of its kind in any country . The money appropriated for the use of the Ordnance Department has been regularly and economically applied . The fabrication of arms at the national armories and by contract with the Department has been gradually improving in quality and cheapness . It is believed that their quality is now such as to admit of but little improvement . The completion of the fortifications renders it necessary that there should be a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricating the cannon and carriages necessary for those works . Under the appropriation of 5 , 000 for exploring the Western waters for the location of a site for a Western armory , a commission was constituted , consisting of Colonel McRee , Colonel Lee , and Captain Talcott , who have been engaged in exploring the country . They have not yet reported the result of their labors , but it is believed that they will be prepared to do it at an early part of the session of Congress . During the month of June last General Ashley and his party , who were trading under a license from the Government , were attacked by the Ricarees while peaceably trading with the Indians at their request . Several of the party were killed and wounded and their property taken or destroyed . Colonel Leavenworth , who commanded Fort Atkinson , at the Council Bluffs , the most western post , apprehending that the hostile spirit of the Ricarees would extend to other tribes in that quarter , and that thereby the lives of the traders on the Missouri and the peace of the frontier would be endangered , took immediate measures to check the evil . With a detachment of the regiment stationed at the Bluffs he successfully attacked the Ricaree village , and it is hoped that such an impression has been made on them as well as on the other tribes on the Missouri as will prevent a recurrence of future hostility . The report of the Secretary of War , which is herewith transmitted , will exhibit in greater detail the condition of the Department in its various branches , and the progress which has been made in its administration during the three first quarters of the year . I transmit a return of the militia of the several States according to the last reports which have been made by the proper officers in each to the Department of War . by reference to this return it will be seen that it is not complete , although great exertions have been made to make it so . As the defense and even the liberties of the country must depend in times of imminent danger on the militia , it is of the highest importance that it be well organized , armed , and disciplined throughout the Union . The report of the Secretary of War shews the progress made during the three first quarters of the present year by the application of the fund appropriated for arming the militia . Much difficulty is found in distributing the arms according to the act of Congress providing for it from the failure of the proper departments in many of the States to make regular returns . The act of 1820 05 12 provides that the system of tactics and regulations of the various corps of the Regular Army shall be extended to the militia . This act has been very imperfectly executed from the want of uniformity in the organization of the militia , proceeding from the defects of the system itself , and especially in its application to that main arm of the public defense . It is thought that this important subject in all its branches merits the attention of Congress . The report of the Secretary of the Navy , which is now communicated , furnishes an account of the administration of that Department for the three first quarters of the present year , with the progress made in augmenting the Navy , and the manner in which the vessels in commission have been employed . The usual force has been maintained in the Mediterranean Sea , the Pacific Ocean , and along the Atlantic coast , and has afforded the necessary protection to our commerce in those seas . In the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico our naval force has been augmented by the addition of several small vessels provided for by the act authorizing an additional naval force for the suppression of piracy , passed by Congress at their last session . That armament has been eminently successful in the accomplishment of its object . The piracies by which our commerce in the neighborhood of the island of Cuba had been afflicted have been repressed and the confidence of our merchants in a great measure restored . The patriotic zeal and enterprise of Commodore Porter , to whom the command of the expedition was confided , has been fully seconded by the officers and men under his command . And in reflecting with high satisfaction on the honorable manner in which they have sustained the reputation of their country and its Navy , the sentiment is alloyed only by a concern that in the fulfillment of that arduous service the diseases incident to the season and to the climate in which it was discharged have deprived the nation of many useful lives , and among them of several officers of great promise . In the month of August a very malignant fever made its appearance at Thompsons Island , which threatened the destruction of our station there . Many perished , and the commanding officer was severely attacked . Uncertain as to his fate and knowing that most of the medical officers had been rendered incapable of discharging their duties , it was thought expedient to send to that post an officer of rank and experience , with several skilled surgeons , to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of its recurrence there in future seasons to furnish every assistance to those who were suffering , and , if practicable , to avoid the necessity of abandoning so important a station . Commodore Rodgers , with a promptitude which did him honor , cheerfully accepted that trust , and has discharged it in the manner anticipated from his skill and patriotism . Before his arrival Commodore Porter , with the greater part of the squadron , had removed from the island and returned to the United States in consequence of the prevailing sickness . Much useful information has , however , been obtained as to the state of the island and great relief afforded to those who had been necessarily left there . Although our expedition , cooperating with an invigorated administration of the government of the island of Cuba , and with the corresponding active exertions of a British naval force in the same seas , have almost entirely destroyed the unlicensed piracies from that island , the success of our exertions has not been equally effectual to suppress the same crime , under other pretenses and colors , in the neighboring island of Porto Rico . They have been committed there under the abusive issue of Spanish commissions . At an early period of the present year remonstrances were made to the governor of that island , by an agent who was sent for the purpose , against those outrages on the peaceful commerce of the United States , of which many had occurred . That officer , professing his own want of authority to make satisfaction for our just complaints , answered only by a reference of them to the Government of Spain . The minister of the United States to that court was specially instructed to urge the necessity of immediate and effectual interposition of that Government , directing restitution and indemnity for wrongs already committed and interdicting the repetition of them . The minister , as has been seen , was debarred access to the Spanish Government , and in the mean time several new cases of flagrant outrage have occurred , and citizens of the United States in the island of Porto Rico have suffered , and others been threatened with assassination for asserting their unquestionable rights even before the lawful tribunals of the country . The usual orders have been given to all our public ships to seize American vessels in the slave trade and bring them in for adjudication , and I have the gratification to state that not one so employed has been discovered , and there is good reason to believe that our flag is now seldom , if at all , disgraced by that traffic . It is a source of great satisfaction that we are always enabled to recur to the conduct of our Navy with price and commendation . As a means of national defense it enjoys the public confidence , and is steadily assuming additional importance . It is submitted whether a more efficient and equally economical organization of it might not in several respects be effected . It is supposed that higher grades than now exist by law would be useful . They would afford well merited rewards to those who have long and faithfully served their country , present the best incentives to good conduct , and the best means of insuring a proper discipline destroy the inequality in that respect between military and naval services , and relieve our officers from many inconveniences and mortifications which occur when our vessels meet those of other nations , ours being the only service in which such grades do not exist . A report of the PostMaster General , which accompanies this communication , will shew the present state of the Post Office Department and its general operations for some years past . There is established by law 88 , 600 miles of post roads , on which the mail is now transported 85 , 700 miles , and contracts have been made for its transportation on all the established routes , with one or 2 exceptions . There are 5 , 240 post offices in the Union , and as many post masters . The gross amount of postage which accrued from 1822 07 01 to 1823 07 01 was 1 , 114 , 345 . 12 . During the same period the expenditures of the Post Office Department amounted to 1 , 169 , 885 . 51 and consisted of the following items , viz Compensation to post masters , 353 , 995 . 98 incidental expenses , 30 , 866 . 37 transportation of the mail , 784 , 600 . 08 payments into the Treasury , 423 . 08 . On the first of July last there was due to the Department from post masters 135 , 245 . 28 from late post masters and contractors , 256 , 749 . 31 making a total amount of balances due to the Department of 391 , 994 . 59 . These balances embrace all delinquencies of post masters and contractors which have taken place since the organization of the Department . There was due by the Department to contractors on the first of July last 26 , 548 . 64 . The transportation of the mail within five years past has been greatly extended , and the expenditures of the Department proportionably increased . Although the postage which has accrued within the last three years has fallen short of the expenditures 262 , 821 . 46 , it appears that collections have been made from the outstanding balances to meet the principal part of the current demands . It is estimated that not more than 250 , 000 of the above balances can be collected , and that a considerable part of this sum can only be realized by a resort to legal process . Some improvements in the receipts for postage is expected . A prompt attention to the collection of moneys received by post masters , it is believed , will enable the Department to continue its operations without aid from the Treasury , unless the expenditures shall be increased by the establishment of new mail routes . A revision of some parts of the post office law may be necessary and it is submitted whether it would not be proper to provide for the appointment of post masters , where the compensation exceeds a certain amount , by nomination to the Senate , as other officers of the General Government are appointed . Having communicated my views to Congress at the commencement of the last session respecting the encouragement which ought to be given to our manufactures and the principle on which it should be founded , I have only to add that those views remain unchanged , and that the present state of those countries with which we have the most immediate political relations and greatest commercial intercourse tends to confirm them . Under this impression I recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose of affording such additional protection to those articles which we are prepared to manufacture , or which are more immediately connected with the defense and independence of the country . The actual state of the public accounts furnishes additional evidence of the efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the public expenditure . Of the moneys drawn from the Treasury since 1817 03 04 , the sum remaining unaccounted for on the 30th of September last is more than 1 . 5M less than on the 30th of September preceding and during the same period a reduction of nearly 1M has been made in the amount of the unsettled accounts for moneys advanced previously to 1817 03 04 . It will be obvious that in proportion as the mass of accounts of the latter description is diminished by settlement the difficulty of settling the residue is increased from the consideration that in many instances it can be obtained only by legal process . For more precise details on this subject I refer to a report from the first Comptroller of the Treasury . The sum which was appropriated at the last session for the repairs of the Cumberland road has been applied with good effect to that object . A final report has not been received from the agent who was appointed to superintend it . As soon as it is received it shall be communicated to Congress . Many patriotic and enlightened citizens who have made the subject an object of particular investigation have suggested an improvement of still greater importance . They are of the opinion that the waters of the Chesapeake and Ohio may be connected together by one continued canal , and at an expense far short of the value and importance of the object to be obtained . If this could be accomplished it is impossible to calculate the beneficial consequences which would result from it . A great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which it would pass would find a market through that channel . Troops might be moved with great facility in war , with cannon and every kind of munition , and in either direction . Connecting the Atlantic with the Western country in a line passing through the seat of the National Government , it would contribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union itself . Believing as I do that Congress possess the right to appropriate money for such a national object the jurisdiction remaining to the States through which the canal would pass , I submit it to your consideration whether it may not be advisable to authorize by an adequate appropriation the employment of a suitable number of the officers of the Corps of Engineers to examine the unexplored ground during the next season and to report their opinion thereon . It will likewise be proper to extend their examination to the several routes through which the waters of the Ohio may be connected by canals with those of Lake Erie . As the Cumberland road will require annual repairs , and Congress have not thought it expedient to recommend to the States an amendment to the Constitution for the purpose of vesting in the United States a power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement , it is also submitted to your consideration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the Executive to enter into an arrangement with the several States through which the road passes to establish tolls , each within its limits , for the purpose of defraying the expense of future repairs and of providing also by suitable penalties for its protection against future injuries . The act of Congress of 1822 05 07 , appropriated the sum of 22 , 700 for the purpose of erecting two piers as a shelter for vessels from ice near Cape Henlopen , Delaware Bay . To effect the object of the act the officers of the Board of Engineers , with Commodore Bainbridge , were directed to prepare plans and estimates of piers sufficient to answer the purpose intended by the act . It appears by their report , which accompanies the documents from the War Department , that the appropriation is not adequate to the purpose intended and as the piers would be of great service both to the navigation of the Delaware Bay and the protection of vessels on the adjacent parts of the coast , I submit for the consideration of Congress whether additional and sufficient appropriations should not be made . The Board of Engineers were also directed to examine and survey the entrance of the harbor of the port of Presquille , in Pin order to make an estimate of the expense of removing the obstructions to the entrance , with a plan of the best mode of effecting the same , under the appropriation for that purpose by act of Congress passed 3rd of March last . The report of the Board accompanies the papers from the War Department , and is submitted for the consideration of Congress . A strong hope has been long entertained , founded on the heroic struggle of the Greeks , that they would succeed in their contest and resume their equal station among the nations of the earth . It is believed that the whole civilized world take a deep interest in their welfare . Although no power has declared in their favor , yet none according to our information , has taken part against them . Their cause and their name have protected them from dangers which might ere this have overwhelmed any other people . The ordinary calculations of interest and of acquisition with a view to aggrandizement , which mingles so much in the transactions of nations , seem to have had no effect in regard to them . From the facts which have come to our knowledge there is good cause to believe that their enemy has lost forever all dominion over them that Greece will become again an independent nation . That she may obtain that rank is the object of our most ardent wishes . It was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great effort was then making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the people of those countries , and that it appeared to be conducted with extraordinary moderation . It need scarcely be remarked that the result has been so far very different from what was then anticipated . Of events in that quarter of the globe , with which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive our origin , we have always been anxious and interested spectators . The citizens of the United States cherish sentiments the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their fellow men on that side of the Atlantic . In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part , nor does it comport with our policy so to do . It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our defense . With the movements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected , and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers . The political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from that of America . This difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective Governments and to the defense of our own , which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure , and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens , and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity , this whole nation is devoted . We owe it , therefore , to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety . With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and shall not interfere , but with the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it , and whose independence we have , on great consideration and on just principles , acknowledged , we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them , or controlling in any other manner their destiny , by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States . In the war between those new Governments and Spain we declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition , and to this we have adhered , and shall continue to adhere , provided no change shall occur which , in the judgment of the competent authorities of this Government , shall make a corresponding change on the part of the United States indispensable to their security . The late events in Spain and Portugal shew that Europe is still unsettled . Of this important fact no stronger proof can be adduced than that the allied powers should have thought it proper , on any principle satisfactory to themselves , to have interposed by force in the internal concerns of Spain . To what extent such interposition may be carried , on the same principle , is a question in which all independent powers whose governments differ from theirs are interested , even those most remote , and surely none more so than the United States . Our policy in regard to Europe , which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe , nevertheless remains the same , which is , not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers to consider the government de facto as the legitimate government for us to cultivate friendly relations with it , and to preserve those relations by a frank , firm , and manly policy , meeting in all instances the just claims of every power , submitting to injuries from none . But in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and conspicuously different . It is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren , if left to themselves , would adopt it of their own accord . It is equally impossible , therefore , that we should behold such interposition in any form with indifference . If we look to the comparative strength and resources of Spain and those new Governments , and their distance from each other , it must be obvious that she can never subdue them . It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves , in the hope that other powers will pursue the same course . If we compare the present condition of our Union with its actual state at the close of our Revolution , the history of the world furnishes no example of a progress in improvement in all the important circumstances which constitute the happiness of a nation which bears any resemblance to it . At the first epoch our population did not exceed 3 , 000 , 000 . by the last census it amounted to about 10 , 000 , 000 , and , what is more extraordinary , it is almost altogether native , for the immigration from other countries has been inconsiderable . At the first epoch half the territory within our acknowledged limits was uninhabited and a wilderness . Since then new territory has been acquired of vast extent , comprising within it many rivers , particularly the Mississippi , the navigation of which to the ocean was of the highest importance to the original States . Over this territory our population has expanded in every direction , and new States have been established almost equal in number to those which formed the first bond of our Union . This expansion of our population and accession of new States to our Union have had the happiest effect on all its highest interests . That it has eminently augmented our resources and added to our strength and respectability as a power is admitted by all , but it is not in these important circumstances only that this happy effect is felt . It is manifest that by enlarging the basis of our system and increasing the number of States the system itself has been greatly strengthened in both its branches . Consolidation and disunion have thereby been rendered equally impracticable . Each Government , confiding in its own strength , has less to apprehend from the other , and in consequence each , enjoying a greater freedom of action , is rendered more efficient for all the purposes for which it was instituted . It is unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement made in the system itself by the adoption of this Constitution and of its happy effect in elevating the character and in protecting the rights of the nation as well as individuals . To what , then , do we owe these blessings It is known to all that we derive them from the excellence of our institutions . Ought we not , then , to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate them<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The auspicious circumstances under which you will commence the duties of the present session will lighten the burdens inseparable from the high trust committed to you . The fruits of the earth have been unusually abundant , commerce has flourished , the revenue has exceeded the most favorable anticipation , and peace and amity are preserved with foreign nations on conditions just and honorable to our country . For these inestimable blessings we can not but be grateful to that Providence which watches over the destiny of nations . As the term limited for the operation of the commercial convention with Great Britain will expire early in the month of July next , and it was deemed important that there should be no interval during which that portion of our commerce which was provided for by that convention should not be regulated , either by arrangement between the two Governments or by the authority of Congress , the minister of the United States at London was instructed early in the last summer to invite the attention of the British Government to the subject , with a view to that object . He was instructed to propose also that the negotiation which it was wished to open might extend to the general commerce of the two countries , and to every other interest and unsettled difference between them in the hope that an arrangement might be made on principles of reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and provide in a satisfactory manner for all these high concerns . I have the satisfaction to state that the proposal was received by the British Government in the spirit which prompted it , and that a negotiation has been opened at London embracing all these objects . On full consideration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust it was thought proper to commit it to not less than two of our distinguished citizens , and in consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris has been associated with our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at London , to both of whom corresponding instructions have been given , and they are now engaged in the discharge of its duties . It is proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience resulting from the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subjects it was agreed before entering on it that the existing convention should be continued for a term not less than eight years . Our relations with Spain remain nearly in the state in which they were at the close of the last session . The convention of 1802 , providing for the adjustment of a certain portion of the claims of our citizens for injuries sustained by spoliation , and so long suspended by the Spanish Government , has at length been ratified by it , but no arrangement has yet been made for the payment of another portion of like claims , not less extensive or well founded , or for other classes of claims , or for the settlement of boundaries . These subjects have again been brought under consideration in both countries , but no agreement has been entered into respecting them . In the mean time events have occurred which clearly prove the ill effect of the policy which that Government has so long pursued on the friendly relations of the two countries , which it is presumed is at least of as much importance to Spain as to the United States to maintain . A state of things has existed in the Floridas the tendency of which has been obvious to all who have paid the slightest attention to the progress of affairs in that quarter . Throughout the whole of those Provinces to which the Spanish title extends the Government of Spain has scarcely been felt . Its authority has been confined almost exclusively to the walls of Pensacola and Augustine , within which only small garrisons have been maintained . Adventurers from every country , fugitives from justice , and absconding slaves have found an asylum there . Several tribes of Indians , strong in the of their warriors , remarkable for their ferocity , and whose settlements extend to our limits , inhabit those Provinces . These different hordes of people , connected together , disregarding on the one side the authority of Spain , and protected on the other by an imaginary line which separates Florida from the United States , have violated our laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves , have practiced various frauds on our revenue , and committed every kind of outrage on our peaceable citizens which their proximity to us enabled them to perpetrate . The invasion of Amelia Island last year by a small band of adventurers , not exceeding 150 in number , who wrested it from the inconsiderable Spanish force stationed there , and held it several months , during which a single feeble effort only was made to recover it , which failed , clearly proves how completely extinct the Spanish authority had become , as the conduct of those adventurers while in possession of the island as distinctly shows the pernicious purposes for which their combination had been formed . This country had , in fact , become the theater of every species of lawless adventure . With little population of its own , the Spanish authority almost extinct , and the colonial governments in a state of revolution , having no pretension to it , and sufficiently employed in their own concerns , it was in great measure derelict , and the object of cupidity to every adventurer . A system of buccaneering was rapidly organizing over it which menaced in its consequences the lawful commerce of every nation , and particularly the United States , while it presented a temptation to every people , on whose seduction its success principally depended . In regard to the United States , the pernicious effect of this unlawful combination was not confined to the ocean the Indian tribes have constituted the effective force in Florida . With these tribes these adventurers had formed at an early period a connection with a view to avail themselves of that force to promote their own projects of accumulation and aggrandizement . It is to the interference of some of these adventurers , in misrepresenting the claims and titles of the Indians to land and in practicing on their savage propensities , that the Seminole war is principally to be traced . Men who thus connect themselves with savage communities and stimulate them to war , which is always attended on their part with acts of barbarity the most shocking , deserve to be viewed in a worse light than the savages . They would certainly have no claim to an immunity from the punishment which , according to the rules of warfare practiced by the savages , might justly be inflicted on the savages themselves . If the embarrassments of Spain prevented her from making an indemnity to our citizens for so long a time from her treasury for their losses by spoliation and otherwise , it was always in her power to have provided it by the cession of this territory . Of this her Government has been repeatedly apprised , and the cession was the more to have been anticipated as Spain must have known that in ceding it she would likewise relieve herself from the important obligation secured by the treaty of 1795 and all other compromitments respecting it . If the United States , from consideration of these embarrassments , declined pressing their claims in a spirit of hostility , the motive ought at least to have been duly appreciated by the Government of Spain . It is well known to her Government that other powers have made to the United States an indemnity for like losses sustained by their citizens at the same epoch . There is nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and forbearance can in no instance be justified . If it was proper to rely on amicable negotiation for an indemnity for losses , it would not have been so to have permitted the inability of Spain to fulfill her engagements and to sustain her authority in the Floridas to be perverted by foreign adventurers and savages to purposes so destructive to the lives of our fellow citizens and the highest interests of the United States . The right of self defense never ceases . It is among the most sacred , and alike necessary to nations and to individuals , and whether the attack be made by Spain herself or by those who abuse her power , its obligation is not the less strong . The invaders of Amelia Island had assumed a popular and respected title under which they might approach and wound us . As their object was distinctly seen , and the duty imposed on the Executive by an existing law was profoundly felt , that mask was not permitted to protect them . It was thought incumbent on the United States to suppress the establishment , and it was accordingly done . The combination in Florida for the unlawful purposes stated , the acts perpetrated by that combination , and , above all , the incitement of the Indians to massacre our fellow citizens of every age and of both sexes , merited a like treatment and received it . In pursuing these savages to an imaginary line in the woods it would have been the height of folly to have suffered that line to protect them . Had that been done the war could never cease . Even if the territory had been exclusively that of Spain and her power complete over it , we had a right by the law of nations to follow the enemy on it and to subdue him there . But the territory belonged , in a certain sense at least , to the savage enemy who inhabited it the power of Spain had ceased to exist over it , and protection was sought under her title by those who had committed on our citizens hostilities which she was bound by treaty to have prevented , but had not the power to prevent . To have stopped at that line would have given new encouragement to these savages and new vigor to the whole combination existing there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purposes . In suppressing the establishment at Amelia Island no unfriendliness was manifested toward Spain , because the post was taken from a force which had wrested it from her . The measure , it is true , was not adopted in concert with the Spanish Government or those in authority under it , because in transactions connected with the war in which Spain and the colonies are engaged it was thought proper in doing justice to the United States to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent parties without consulting or acting in concert with either . It gives me pleasure to state that the Governments of Buenos Ayres and Venezuela , whose names were assumed , have explicitly disclaimed all participation in those measures , and even the knowledge of them until communicated by this Government , and have also expressed their satisfaction that a course of proceedings had been suppressed which if justly imputable to them would dishonor their cause . In authorizing Major General Jackson to enter Florida in pursuit of the Seminoles care was taken not to encroach on the rights of Spain . I regret to have to add that in executing this order facts were disclosed respecting the conduct of the officers of Spain in authority there in encouraging the war , furnishing munitions of war and other supplies to carry it on , and in other acts not less marked which evinced their participation in the hostile purposes of that combination and justified the confidence with which it inspired the savages that by those officers they would be protected . A conduct so incompatible with the friendly relations existing between the two countries , particularly with the positive obligations of the 5th article of the treaty of 1795 , by which Spain was bound to restrain , even by force , those savages from acts of hostility against the United States , could not fail to excite surprise . The commanding general was convinced that he should fail in his object , that he should in effect accomplish nothing , if he did not deprive those savages of the resource on which they had calculated and of the protection on which they had relied in making the war . As all the documents relating to this occurrence will be laid before Congress , it is not necessary to enter into further detail respecting it . Although the reasons which induced Major General Jackson to take these posts were duly appreciated , there was nevertheless no hesitation in deciding on the course which it became the Government to pursue . As there was reason to believe that the commanders of these posts had violated their instructions , there was no disposition to impute to their Government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile . An order was in consequence issued to the general in command there to deliver the posts Pensacola unconditionally to any person duly authorized to receive it , and Marks , which is in the heart of the Indian country , on the arrival of a competent force to defend it against those savages and their associates . In entering Florida to suppress this combination no idea was entertained of hostility to Spain , and however justifiable the commanding general was , in consequence of the misconduct of the Spanish officers , in entering Marks and Pensacola to terminate it by proving to the savages and their associates that they should not be protected even there , yet the amicable relations existing between the United States and Spain could not be altered by that act alone . By ordering the restitution of the posts those relations were preserved . To a change of them the power of the Executive is deemed incompetent it is vested in Congress only . By this measure , so promptly taken , due respect was shown to the Government of Spain . The misconduct of her officers has not been imputed to her . She was enabled to review with candor her relations with the United States and her own situation , particularly in respect to the territory in question , with the dangers inseparable from it , and regarding the losses we have sustained for which indemnity has been so long withheld , and the injuries we have suffered through that territory , and her means of redress , she was likewise enabled to take with honor the course best calculated to do justice to the United States and to promote her own welfare . Copies of the instructions to the commanding general , of his correspondence with the Secretary of War , explaining his motives and justifying his conduct , with a copy of the proceedings of the courts martial in the trial of Arbuthnot and Ambristie , and of the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the minister plenipotentiary of Spain near this Government , and of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid with the Government of Spain , will be laid before Congress . The civil war which has so long prevailed between Spain and the Provinces in South America still continues , without any prospect of its speedy termination . The information respecting the condition of those countries which has been collected by the commissioners recently returned from thence will be laid before Congress in copies of their reports , with such other information as has been received from other agents of the United States . It appears from these communications that the Government at Buenos Ayres declared itself independent in 1816 July , having previously exercised the power of an independent Government , though in the name of the King of Spain , from the year 1810 that the Banda Oriental , Entre Rios , and Paraguay , with the city of Santa Fee , all of which are also independent , are unconnected with the present Government of Buenos Ayres that Chili has declared itself independent and is closely connected with Buenos Ayres that Venezuela has also declared itself independent , and now maintains the conflict with various success and that the remaining parts of South America , except Monte Video and such other portions of the eastern bank of the La Plata as are held by Portugal , are still in the possession of Spain or in a certain degree under her influence . By a circular note addressed by the ministers of Spain to the allied powers , with whom they are respectively accredited , it appears that the allies have undertaken to mediate between Spain and the South American Provinces , and that the manner and extent of their interposition would be settled by a congress which was to have met at Aix la Chapelle in September last . From the general policy and course of proceeding observed by the allied powers in regard to this contest it is inferred that they will confine their interposition to the expression of their sentiments , abstaining from the application of force . I state this impression that force will not be applied with the greater satisfaction because it is a course more consistent with justice and likewise authorizes a hope that the calamities of the war will be confined to the parties only , and will be of shorter duration . From the view taken of this subject , founded on all the information that we have been able to obtain , there is good cause to be satisfied with the course heretofore pursued by the United States in regard to this contest , and to conclude that it is proper to adhere to it , especially in the present state of affairs . I have great satisfaction in stating that our relations with France , Russia , and other powers continue on the most friendly basis . In our domestic concerns we have ample cause of satisfaction . The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year have exceeded 17 After satisfying all the demands which have been made under existing appropriations , including the final extinction of the old 6 stock and the redemption of a moiety of the Louisiana debt , it is estimated that there will remain in the Treasury on the 1st day of January next more than 2 It is ascertained that the gross revenue which has accrued from the customs during the same period amounts to 21and that the revenue of the whole year may be estimated at not less than 26The sale of the public lands during the year has also greatly exceeded , both in quantity and price , that of any former year , and there is just reason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue . It is gratifying to know that although the annual expenditure has been increased by the act of the last session of Congress providing for Revolutionary pensions to an amount about equal to the proceeds of the internal duties which were then repealed , the revenue for the ensuing year will be proportionally augmented , and that whilst the public expenditure will probably remain stationary , each successive year will add to the national resources by the ordinary increase of our population and by the gradual development of our latent sources of national prosperity . The strict execution of the revenue laws , resulting principally from the salutary provisions of the act of the 20th of April last amending the several collection laws , has , it is presumed , secured to domestic manufactures all the relief that can be derived from the duties which have been imposed upon foreign merchandise for their protection . Under the influence of this relief several branches of this important national interest have assumed greater activity , and although it is hoped that others will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle , yet the expediency of granting further protection is submitted to your consideration . The measures of defense authorized by existing laws have been pursued with the zeal and activity due to so important an object , and with all the dispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking . The survey of our maritime and inland frontiers has been continued , and at the points where it was decided to erect fortifications the work has been commenced , and in some instances considerable progress has been made . In compliance with resolutions of the last session , the Board of Commissioners were directed to examine in a particular manner the parts of the coast therein designated and to report their opinion of the most suitable sites for two naval depots . This work is in a train of execution . The opinion of the Board on this subject , with a plan of all the works necessary to a general system of defense so far as it has been formed , will be laid before Congress in a report from the proper department as soon as it can be prepared . In conformity with the appropriations of the last session , treaties have been formed with the Quapaw tribe of Indians , inhabiting the country on the Arkansaw , and the Great and Little Osages north of the White River with the tribes in the State of Indiana with the several tribes within the State of Ohio and the Michigan Territory , and with the Chickasaws , by which very extensive cessions of territory have been made to the United States . Negotiations are now depending with the tribes in the Illinois Territory and with the Choctaws , by which it is expected that other extensive cessions will be made . I take great interest in stating that the cessions already made , which are considered so important to the United States , have been obtained on conditions very satisfactory to the Indians . With a view to the security of our inland frontiers , it has been thought expedient to establish strong posts at the mouth of Yellow Stone River and at the Mandan village on the Missouri , and at the mouth of Peters on the Mississippi , at no great distance from our northern boundaries . It can hardly be presumed while such posts are maintained in the rear of the Indian tribes that they will venture to attack our peaceable inhabitants . A strong hope is entertained that this measure will likewise be productive of much good to the tribes themselves , especially in promoting the great object of their civilization . Experience has clearly demonstrated that independent savage communities can not long exist within the limits of a civilized population . The progress of the latter has almost invariably terminated in the extinction of the former , especially of the tribes belonging to our portion of this hemisphere , among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have been conspicuous . To civilize them , and even to prevent their extinction , it seems to be indispensable that their independence as communities should cease , and that the control of the United States over them should be complete and undisputed . The hunter state will then be more easily abandoned , and recourse will be had to the acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuits tending to dissolve the ties which connect them together as a savage community and to give a new character to every individual . I present this subject to the consideration of Congress on the presumption that it may be found expedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provisions , having these objects in view , relative to the tribes within our settlements . It has been necessary during the present year to maintain , a strong naval force in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico , and to send some public ships along the southern coast and to the Pacific Ocean . By these means amicable relations with the Barbary Powers have been preserved , our commerce has been protected , and our rights respected . The augmentation of our Navy is advancing with a steady progress toward the limit contemplated by law . I communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another State Illinois to our Union , because I perceive from the proof afforded by the additions already made the regular progress and sure consummation of a policy of which history affords no example , and of which the good effect can not be too highly estimated . By extending our Government on the principles of our Constitution over the vast territory within our limits , on the Lakes and the Mississippi and its numerous streams , new life and vigor are infused into every part of our system . By increasing the number of the States the confidence of the State governments in their own security is increased and their jealousy of the National Government proportionally diminished . The impracticability of one consolidated Government for this great and growing nation will be more apparent and will be universally admitted . Incapable of exercising local authority except for general purposes , the General Government will no longer be dreaded . In those cases of a local nature and for all the great purposes for which it was instituted its authority will be cherished . Each Government will acquire new force and a greater freedom of action within its proper sphere . Other inestimable advantages will follow . Our produce will be augmented to an incalculable amount in articles of the greatest value for domestic use and foreign commerce . Our navigation will in like degree be increased , and as the shipping of the Atlantic States will be employed in the transportation of the vast produce of the Western country , even those parts of the United States which are most remote from each other will be further bound together by the strongest ties which mutual interest can create . The situation of this District , it is thought , requires the attention of Congress . By the Constitution the power of legislation is exclusively vested in the Congress of the United States . In the exercise of this power , in which the people have no participation , Congress legislate in all cases directly on the local concerns of the District . As this is a departure , for a special purpose , from the general principles of our system , it may merit consideration whether an arrangement better adapted to the principles of our Government and to the particular interests of the people may not be devised which will neither infringe the Constitution nor affect the object which the provision in question was intended to secure . The growing population , already considerable , and the increasing business of the District , which it is believed already interferes with the deliberations of Congress on great national concerns , furnish additional motives for recommending this subject to your consideration . When we view the great blessings with which our country has been favored , those which we now enjoy , and the means which we possess of handing them down unimpaired to our latest posterity , our attention is irresistibly drawn to the source from whence they flow . Let us , then , unite in offering our most grateful acknowledgments for these blessings to the Divine Author of All Good .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The public buildings being advanced to a stage to afford accommodation for Congress , I offer you my sincere congratulations on the recommencement of your duties in the Capitol . In bringing you to view the incidents most deserving attention which have occurred since your last session , I regret to have to state that several of our principal cities have suffered by sickness , that an unusual drought has prevailed in the Middle and Western States , and that a derangement has been felt in some of our moneyed institutions which has proportionably affected their credit . I am happy , however , to have it in my power to assure you that the health of our cities is now completely restored that the produce of the year , though less abundant than usual , will not only be amply sufficient for home consumption , but afford a large surplus for the supply of the wants of other nations , and that the derangement in the circulating paper medium , by being left to those remedies which its obvious causes suggested and the good sense and virtue of our fellow citizens supplied , has diminished . Having informed Congress , on the 27th of February last , that a treaty of amity , settlement , and limits had been concluded in this city between the United States and Spain , and ratified by the competent authorities of the former , full confidence was entertained that it would have been ratified by His Catholic Majesty with equal promptitude and a like earnest desire to terminate on the conditions of that treaty the differences which had so long existed between the two countries . Every view which the subject admitted of was thought to have justified this conclusion . Great losses had been sustained by citizens of the United States from Spanish cruisers more than 20 years before , which had not been redressed . These losses had been acknowledged and provided for by a treaty as far back as the year 1802 , which , although concluded at Madrid , was not then ratified by the Government of Spain , nor since , until the last year , when it was suspended by the late treaty , a more satisfactory provision to both parties , as was presumed , having been made for them . Other differences had arisen in this long interval , affecting their highest interests , which were likewise provided for by this last treaty . The treaty itself was formed on great consideration and a thorough knowledge of all circumstances , the subject matter of every article having been for years under discussion and repeated references having been made by the minister of Spain to his Government on the points respecting which the greatest difference of opinion prevailed . It was formed by a minister duly authorized for the purpose , who had represented his Government in the United States and been employed in this long protracted negotiation several years , and who , it is not denied , kept strictly within the letter of his instructions . The faith of Spain was therefore pledged , under circumstances of peculiar force and solemnity , for its ratification . On the part of the United States this treaty was evidently acceded to in a spirit of conciliation and concession . The indemnity for injuries and losses so long before sustained , and now again acknowledged and provided for , was to be paid by them without becoming a charge on the treasury of Spain . for territory ceded by Spain other territory of great value , to which our claim was believed to be well founded , was ceded by the United States , and in a quarter more interesting to her . This cession was nevertheless received as the means of indemnifying our citizens in a considerable sum , the presumed amount of their losses . Other considerations of great weight urged the cession of this territory by Spain . It was surrounded by the Territories of the United States on every side except on that of the ocean . Spain had lost her authority over it , and , falling into the hands of adventurers connected with the savages , it was made the means of unceasing annoyance and injury to our Union in many of its most essential interests . By this cession , then , Spain ceded a territory in reality of no value to her and obtained concessions of the highest importance by the settlement of long standing differences with the United States affecting their respective claims and limits , and likewise relieved herself from the obligation of a treaty relating to it which she had failed to fulfill , and also from the responsibility incident to the most flagrant and pernicious abuses of her rights where she could not support her authority . It being known that the treaty was formed under these circumstances , not a doubt was entertained that His Catholic Majesty would have ratified it without delay . I regret to have to state that this reasonable expectation has been disappointed that the treaty was not ratified within the time stipulated and has not since been ratified . As it is important that the nature and character of this unexpected occurrence should be distinctly understood , I think it my duty to communicate to you all the facts and circumstances in my possession relating to it . Anxious to prevent all future disagreement with Spain by giving the most prompt effect to the treaty which had been thus concluded , and particularly by the establishment of a Government in Florida which should preserve order there , the minister of the United States who had been recently appointed to His Catholic Majesty , and to whom the ratification by his Government had been committed to be exchanged for that of Spain , was instructed to transmit the latter to the Department of State as soon as obtained , by a public ship subjected to his order for the purpose . Unexpected delay occurring in the ratification by Spain , he requested to be informed of the cause . It was stated in reply that the great importance of the subject , and a desire to obtain explanations on certain points which were not specified , had produced the delay , and that an envoy would be dispatched to the United States to obtain such explanations of this Government . The minister of the United States offered to give full explanation on any point on which it might be desired , which proposal was declined . Having communicated this result to the Department of State in August last , he was instructed , notwithstanding the disappointment and surprise which it produced , to inform the Government of Spain that if the treaty should be ratified and transmitted here at any time before the meeting of Congress it would be received and have the same effect as if it had been ratified in due time . This order was executed , the authorized communication was made to the Government of Spain , and by its answer , which has just been received , we are officially made acquainted for the first time with the causes which have prevented the ratification of the treaty by His Catholic Majesty . It is alleged by the minister of Spain that his Government had attempted to alter one of the principal articles of the treaty by a declaration which the minister of the United States had been ordered to present when he should deliver the ratification by his Government in exchange for that of Spain , and of which he gave notice , explanatory of the sense in which that article was understood . It is further alleged that this Government had recently tolerated or protected an expedition from the United States against the Province of Texas . These two imputed acts are stated as the reasons which have induced His Catholic Majesty to withhold his ratification from the treaty , to obtain explanations respecting which it is repeated that an envoy would be forthwith dispatched to the United States . How far these allegations will justify the conduct of the Government of Spain will appear on a view of the following facts and the evidence which supports them It will be seen by the documents transmitted herewith that the declaration mentioned relates to a clause in the 8th article concerning certain grants of land recently made by His Catholic Majesty in Florida , which it was understood had conveyed all the lands which until then had been ungranted it was the intention of the parties to annul these latter grants , and that clause was drawn for that express purpose and for none other . The date of these grants was unknown , but it was understood to be posterior to that inserted in the article indeed , it must be obvious to all that if that provision in the treaty had not the effect of annulling these grants , it would be altogether nugatory . Immediately after the treaty was concluded and ratified by this Government an intimation was received that these grants were of anterior date to that fixed on by the treaty and that they would not , of course , be affected by it . The mere possibility of such a case , so inconsistent with the intention of the parties and the meaning of the article , induced this Government to demand an explanation on the subject , which was immediately granted , and which corresponds with this statement . WRT the other act alleged , that this Government had tolerated or protected an expedition against Texas , it is utterly without foundation . Every discountenance has invariably been given to any such attempt within the limits of the United States , as is fully evinced by the acts of the Government and the proceedings of the courts . There being cause , however , to apprehend , in the course of the last summer , that some adventurers entertained views of the kind suggested , the attention of the constituted authorities in that quarter was immediately drawn to them , and it is known that the project , whatever it might be , has utterly failed . These facts will , it is presumed , satisfy every impartial mind that the Government of Spain had no justifiable cause for declining to ratify the treaty . A treaty concluded in conformity with instructions is obligatory , in good faith , in all its stipulations , according to the true intent and meaning of the parties . Each party is bound to ratify it . If either could set it aside without the consent of the other , there would be no longer any rules applicable to such transactions between nations . By this proceeding the Government of Spain has rendered to the United States a new and very serious injury . It has been stated that a minister would be sent to ask certain explanations of this Government but if such were desired , why were they not asked within the time limited for the ratification Is it contemplated to open a new negotiation respecting any of the articles or conditions of the treaty If that were done , to what consequences might it not lead At what time and in what manner would a new negotiation terminate By this proceeding Spain has formed a relation between the two countries which will justify any measures on the part of the United States which a strong sense of injury and a proper regard for the rights and interests of the nation may dictate . In the course to be pursued these objects should be constantly held in view and have their due weight . Our national honor must be maintained , and a new and a distinguished proof be afforded of that regard for justice and moderation which has invariably governed the councils of this free people . It must be obvious to all that if the United States had been desirous of making conquests , or had been even willing to aggrandize themselves in that way , they could have had no inducement to form this treaty . They would have much cause for gratulation at the course which has been pursued by Spain . An ample field for ambition is open before them , but such a career is not consistent with the principles of their Government nor the interests of the nation . From a full view of all circumstances , it is submitted to the consideration of Congress whether it will not be proper for the United States to carry the conditions of the treaty into effect in the same manner as if it had been ratified by Spain , claiming on their part all its advantages and yielding to Spain those secured to her . By pursuing this course we shall rest on the sacred ground of right , sanctioned in the most solemn manner by Spain herself by a treaty which she was bound to ratify , for refusing to do which she must incur the censure of other nations , even those most friendly to her , while by confining ourselves within that limit we can not fail to obtain their well merited approbation . We must have peace on a frontier where we have been so long disturbed our citizens must be indemnified for losses so long since sustained , and for which indemnity has been so unjustly withheld from them . Accomplishing these great objects , we obtain all that is desirable . But His Catholic Majesty has twice declared his determination to send a minister to the United States to ask explanations on certain points and to give them respecting his delay to ratify the treaty . Shall we act by taking the ceded territory and proceeding to execute the other conditions of the treaty before this minister arrives and is heard This is a case which forms a strong appeal to the candor , the magnanimity , and the honor of this people . Much is due to courtesy between nations . By a short delay we shall lose nothing , for , resting on the ground of immutable truth and justice , we can not be diverted from our purpose . It ought to be presumed that the explanations which may be given to the minister of Spain will be satisfactory , and produce the desired result . In any event , the delay for the purpose mentioned , being a further manifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly manner all differences with Spain , can not fail to be duly appreciated by His Catholic Majesty as well as by other powers . It is submitted , therefore , whether it will not be proper to make the law proposed for carrying the conditions of the treaty into effect , should it be adopted , contingent to suspend its operation , upon the responsibility of the Executive , in such manner as to afford an opportunity for such friendly explanations as may be desired during the present session of Congress . I communicate to Congress a copy of the treaty and of the instructions to the minister of the United States at Madrid respecting it of his correspondence with the minister of Spain , and of such other documents as may be necessary to give a full view of the subject . In the course which the Spanish Government have on this occasion thought proper to pursue it is satisfactory to know that they have not been countenanced by any other European power . On the contrary , the opinion and wishes both of France and Great Britain have not been withheld either from the United States or from Spain , and have been unequivocal in favor of the ratification . There is also reason to believe that the sentiments of the Imperial Government of Russia have been the same , and that they have also been made known to the cabinet of Madrid . In the civil war existing between Spain and the Spanish Provinces in this hemisphere the greatest care has been taken to enforce the laws intended to preserve an impartial neutrality . Our ports have continued to be equally open to both parties and on the same conditions , and our citizens have been equally restrained from interfering in favor of either to the prejudice of the other . The progress of the war , however has operated manifestly in favor of the colonies . Buenos Ayres still maintains unshaken the independence which it declared in 1816 , and has enjoyed since 1810 . Like success has also lately attended Chili and the Provinces north of the La Plata bordering on it , and likewise Venezuela . This contest has from its commencement been very interesting to other powers , and to none more so than to the United States . A virtuous people may and will confine themselves within the limit of a strict neutrality but it is not in their power to behold a conflict so vitally important to their neighbors without the sensibility and sympathy which naturally belong to such a case . It has been the steady purpose of this Government to prevent that feeling leading to excess , and it is very gratifying to have it in my power to state that so strong has been the sense throughout the whole community of what was due to the character and obligations of the nation that very few examples of a contrary kind have occurred . The distance of the colonies from the parent country and the great extent of their population and resources gave them advantages which it was anticipated at a very early period would be difficult for Spain to surmount . The steadiness , consistency , and success with which they have pursued their object , as evinced more particularly by the undisturbed sovereignty which Buenos Ayres has so long enjoyed , evidently give them a strong claim to the favorable consideration of other nations . These sentiments on the part of the United States have not been withheld from other powers , with whom it is desirable to act in concert . Should it become manifest to the world that the efforts of Spain to subdue these Provinces will be fruitless , it may be presumed that the Spanish Government itself will give up the contest . In producing such a determination it can not be doubted that the opinion of friendly powers who have taken no part in the controversy will have their merited influence . It is of the highest importance to our national character and indispensable to the morality of our citizens that all violations of our neutrality should be prevented . No door should be left open for the evasion of our laws , no opportunity afforded to any who may be disposed to take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the nation . It is submitted , therefore , to the consideration of Congress whether it may not be advisable to revise the laws with a view to this desirable result . It is submitted also whether it may not be proper to designate by law the several ports or places along the coast at which only foreign ships of war and privateers may be admitted . The difficulty of sustaining the regulations of our commerce and of other important interests from abuse without such designation furnishes a strong motive for this measure . At the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial convention between the United States and Great Britain a hope had been entertained that an article might have been agreed upon mutually satisfactory to both countries , regulating upon principles of justice and reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the United States and the British possessions as well in the West Indies as upon the continent of North America . The plenipotentiaries of the two Governments not having been able to come to an agreement on this important interest , those of the United States reserved for the consideration of this Government the proposals which had been presented to them as the ultimate offer on the part of the British Government , and which they were not authorized to accept . On their transmission here they were examined with due deliberation , the result of which was a new effort to meet the views of the British Government . The minister of the United States was instructed to make a further proposal , which has not been accepted . It was , however , declined in an amicable manner . I recommend to the consideration of Congress whether further prohibitory provisions in the laws relating to this intercourse may not be expedient . It is seen with interest that although it has not been practicable as yet to agree in any arrangement of this important branch of their commerce , such is the disposition of the parties that each will view any regulations which the other may make respecting it in the most friendly light . By the 5th article of the convention concluded on 1818 10 20 , it was stipulated that the differences which have arisen between the two Governments with respect to the true intent and meaning of the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent , in relation to the carrying away by British officers of slaves from the United States after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of peace , should be referred to the decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be named for that purpose . The minister of the United States has been instructed to name to the British Government a foreign sovereign , the common friend to both parties , for the decision of this question . The answer of that Government to the proposal when received will indicate the further measures to be pursued on the part of the United States . Although the pecuniary embarrassments which affected various parts of the Union during the latter part of the preceding year have during the present been considerably augmented , and still continue to exist , the receipts into the Treasury to the 30th of September last have amounted to 19After defraying the current expenses of the Government , including the interest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to that period , amounting to 18 . 2there remained in the Treasury on that day more than 2 . 5which , with the sums receivable during the remainder of the year , will exceed the current demands upon the Treasury for the same period . The causes which have tended to diminish the public receipts could not fail to have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which has accrued upon imposts and tonnage during the three first quarters of the present year . It is , however , ascertained that the duties which have been secured during that period exceed 18and those of the whole year will probably amount to 23 For the probably receipts of the next year I refer you to the statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury , which will enable you to judge whether further provision be necessary . The great reduction in the price of the principal articles of domestic growth which has occurred during the present year , and the consequent fall in the price of labor , apparently so favorable to the success of domestic manufactures , have not shielded them against other causes adverse to their prosperity . The pecuniary embarrassments which have so deeply affected the commercial interests of the nation have been no less adverse to our manufacturing establishments in several sections of the Union . The great reduction of the currency which the banks have been constrained to make in order to continue specie payments , and the vitiated character of it where such reductions have not been attempted , instead of placing within the reach of these establishments the pecuniary aid necessary to avail themselves of the advantages resulting from the reduction in the prices of the raw materials and of labor , have compelled the banks to withdraw from them a portion of the capital heretofore advanced to them . That aid which has been refused by the banks has not been obtained from other sources , owing to the loss of individual confidence from the frequent failures which have recently occurred in some of our principal commercial cities . An additional cause for the depression of these establishments may probably be found in the pecuniary embarrassments which have recently affected those countries with which our commerce has been principally prosecuted . Their manufactures , for the want of a ready or profitable market at home , have been shipped by the manufacturers to the United States , and in many instances sold at a price below their current value at the place of manufacture . Although this practice may from its nature be considered temporary or contingent , it is not on that account less injurious in its effects . Uniformity in the demand and price of an article is highly desirable to the domestic manufacturer . It is deemed of great importance to give encouragement to our domestic manufacturers . In what manner the evils which have been adverted to may be remedied , and how far it may be practicable in other respects to afford to them further encouragement , paying due regard to the other great interests of the nation , is submitted to the wisdom of Congress . The survey of the coast for the establishment of fortifications is now nearly completed , and considerable progress has been made in the collection of materials for the construction of fortifications in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Chesapeake Bay . The works on the eastern bank of the Potomac below Alexandria and on the Pea Patch , in the Delaware , are much advanced , and it is expected that the fortifications at the Narrows , in the harbor of Nwill be completed the present year . To derive all the advantages contemplated from these fortifications it was necessary that they should be judiciously posted , and constructed with a view to permanence . The progress hitherto has therefore been slow but as the difficulties in parts heretofore the least explored and known are surmounted , it will in future be more rapid . As soon as the survey of the coast is completed , which it is expected will be done early in the next spring , the engineers employed in it will proceed to examine for like purposes the northern and northwestern frontiers . The troops intended to occupy a station at the mouth of the Peters , on the Mississippi , have established themselves there , and those who were ordered to the mouth of the Yellow Stone , on the Missouri , have ascended that river to the Council Bluff , where they will remain until the next spring , when they will proceed to the place of their destination . I have the satisfaction to state that this measure has been executed in amity with the Indian tribes , and that it promises to produce , in regard to them , all the advantages which were contemplated by it . Much progress has likewise been made in the construction of ships of war and in the collection of timber and other materials for ship building . It is not doubted that our Navy will soon be augmented to the number and placed in all respects on the footing provided for by law . The Board , consisting of engineers and naval officers , have not yet made their final report of sites for two naval depots , as instructed according to the resolutions of 1818 03 18 and 1818 04 20 , but they have examined the coast therein designated , and their report is expected in the next month . For the protection of our commerce in the Mediterranean , along the southern Atlantic coast , in the Pacific and Indian oceans , it has been found necessary to maintain a strong naval force , which it seems proper for the present to continue . There is much reason to believe that if any portion of the squadron heretofore stationed in the Mediterranean should be withdrawn our intercourse with the powers bordering on that sea would be much interrupted , if not altogether destroyed . Such , too , has been the growth of a spirit of piracy in the other quarters mentioned , by adventurers from every country , in abuse of the friendly flags which they have assumed , that not to protect our commerce there would be to abandon it has a prey to their rapacity . Due attention has likewise been paid to the suppression of the slave trade , in compliance with a law of the last session . Orders have been given to the commanders of all our public ships to seize all vessels navigated under our flag engaged in that trade , and to bring them in to be proceeded against in the manner prescribed by the law . It is hoped that these vigorous measures , supported by like acts by other nations , will soon terminate a commerce so disgraceful to the civilized world . In the execution of the duty imposed by these acts , and of a high trust connected with it , it is with deep regret I have to state the loss which has been sustained by the death of Commodore Perry . His gallantry in a brilliant exploit in the late war added to the renown of his country . His death is deplored as a national misfortune .<speech_sep>
