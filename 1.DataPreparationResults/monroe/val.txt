Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives In communicating to you a just view of public affairs at the commencement of your present labors , I do it with great satisfaction , because , taking all circumstances into consideration which claim attention , I see much cause to rejoice in the felicity of our situation . In making this remark I do not wish to be understood to imply that an unvaried prosperity is to be seen in every interest of this great community . In the progress of a nation inhabiting a territory of such vast extent and great variety of climate , every portion of which is engaged in foreign commerce and liable to be affected in some degree by the changes which occur in the condition and regulations of foreign countries , it would be strange if the produce of our soil and the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizens received at all times and in every quarter an uniform and equal encouragement . This would be more than we would have a right to expect under circumstances the most favorable . Pressures on certain interests , it is admitted , have been felt but allowing to these their greatest extent , they detract but little from the force of the remarks already made . In forming a just estimate of our present situation it is proper to look at the whole in the outline as well as in the detail . A free , virtuous , and enlightened people know well the great principles and causes on which their happiness depends , and even those who suffer most occasionally in their transitory concerns find great relief under their sufferings from the blessings which they otherwise enjoy and in the consoling and animating hope which they administer . From whence do these pressures come Not from a Government which is founded by , administered for , and supported by the people . We trace them to the peculiar character of the epoch in which we live , and to the extraordinary occurrences which have signalized it . The convulsions with which several of the powers of Europe have been shaken and the long and destructive wars in which all were engaged , with their sudden transition to a state of peace , presenting in the 1st instance unusual encouragement to our commerce and withdrawing it in the second even within its wonted limit , could not fail to be sensibly felt here . The station , too , which we had to support through this long conflict , compelled as we were finally to become a party to it with a principal power , and to make great exertions , suffer heavy losses , and to contract considerable debts , disturbing the ordinary course of affairs by augmenting to a vast amount the circulating medium , and thereby elevating at one time the price of every article above a just standard and depressing it at another below it , had likewise its due effect . It is manifest that the pressures of which we complain have proceeded in a great measure from these causes . When , then , we take into view the prosperous and happy condition of our country in all the great circumstances which constitute the felicity of a nation every individual in the full enjoyment of all his rights , the Union blessed with plenty and rapidly rising to greatness under a National Government which operates with complete effect in every part without being felt in any except by the ample protection which it affords , and under State governments which perform their equal share , according to a wise distribution of power between them , in promoting the public happiness it is impossible to behold so gratifying , so glorious a spectacle without being penetrated with the most profound and grateful acknowledgments to the Supreme Author of All Good for such manifold and inestimable blessings . Deeply impressed with these sentiments , I can not regard the pressures to which I have adverted otherwise than in the light of mild and instructive admonitions , warning us of dangers to be shunned in future , teaching us lessons of economy corresponding with the simplicity and purity of our institutions and best adapted to their support , evincing the connection and dependence which the various parts of our happy Union have on each other , thereby augmenting daily our social incorporation and adding by its strong ties new strength and vigor to the political opening a wider range , and with new encouragement , to the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizens at home and abroad , and more especially by the multiplied proofs which it has accumulated of the great perfection of our most excellent system of Government , the powerful instrument in the hands of our All merciful Creator in securing to us these blessings . Happy as our situation is , it does not exempt us from solicitude and care for the future . On the contrary , as the blessings which we enjoy are great , proportionably great should be our vigilance , zeal , and activity to preserve them . Foreign wars may again expose us to new wrongs , which would impose on us new duties for which we ought to be prepared . The state of Europe is unsettled , and how long peace may be preserved is altogether uncertain in addition to which we have interests of our own to adjust which will require particular attention . A correct view of our relations with each power will enable you to form a just idea of existing difficulties , and of the measures of precaution best adapted to them . Respecting our relations with Spain nothing explicit can now be communicated . On the adjournment of Congress in May last the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid was instructed to inform the Government of Spain that if His Catholic Majesty should then ratify the treaty this Government would accept the ratification so far as to submit to the decision of the Senate the question whether such ratification should be received in exchange for that of the United States heretofore given . By letters from the minister of the United States to the Secretary of State it appears that a communication in conformity with his instructions had been made to the Government of Spain , and that the Cortes had the subject under consideration . The result of the deliberations of that body , which is daily expected , will be made known to Congress as soon as it is received . The friendly sentiment which was expressed on the part of the United States in the message of the 9th of May last is still entertained for Spain . Among the causes of regret , however , which are inseparable from the delay attending this transaction it is proper to state that satisfactory information has been received that measures have been recently adopted by designing persons to convert certain parts of the Province of East Florida into depots for the reception of foreign goods , from whence to smuggle them into the United States . By opening a port within the limits of Florida , immediately on our boundary where there was no settlement , the object could not be misunderstood . An early accommodation of differences will , it is hoped , prevent all such fraudulent and pernicious practices , and place the relations of the two countries on a very amicable and permanent basis . The commercial relations between the United States and the British colonies in the West Indies and on this continent have undergone no change , the British Government still preferring to leave that commerce under the restriction heretofore imposed on it on each side . It is satisfactory to recollect that the restraints resorted to by the United States were defensive only , intended to prevent a monopoly under British regulations in favor of Great Britain , as it likewise is to know that the experiment is advancing in a spirit of amity between the parties . The question depending between the United States and Great Britain respecting the construction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent has been referred by both Governments to the decision of the Emperor of Russia , who has accepted the umpirage . An attempt has been made with the Government of France to regulate by treaty the commerce between the two countries on the principle of reciprocity and equality . By the last communication from the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris , to whom full power had been given , we learn that the negotiation has been commenced there but serious difficulties having occurred , the French Government had resolved to transfer it to the United States , for which purpose the minister plenipotentiary of France had been ordered to repair to this city , and whose arrival might soon be expected . It is hoped that this important interest may be arranged on just conditions and in a manner equally satisfactory to both parties . It is submitted to Congress to decide , until such arrangement is made , how far it may be proper , on the principle of the act of the last session which augmented the tonnage duty on French vessels , to adopt other measures for carrying more completely into effect the policy of that act . The act referred to , which imposed new tonnage on French vessels , having been in force from and after the first day of July , it has happened that several vessels of that nation which had been dispatched from France before its existence was known have entered the ports of the United States , and been subject to its operation , without that previous notice which the general spirit of our laws gives to individuals in similar cases . The object of that law having been merely to countervail the inequalities which existed to the disadvantage of the United States in their commercial intercourse with France , it is submitted also to the consideration of Congress whether , in the spirit of amity and conciliation which it is no less the inclination than the policy of the United States to preserve in their intercourse with other powers , it may not be proper to extend relief to the individuals interested in those cases by exempting from the operation of the law all those vessels which have entered our ports without having had the means of previously knowing the existence of the additional duty . The contest between Spain and the colonies , according to the most authentic information , is maintained by the latter with improved success . The unfortunate divisions which were known to exist some time since at Buenos Ayres it is understood still prevail . In no part of South America has Spain made any impression on the colonies , while in many parts , and particularly in Venezuela and New Grenada , the colonies have gained strength and acquired reputation , both for the management of the war in which they have been successful and for the order of the internal administration . The late change in the Government of Spain , by the reestablishment of the constitution of 1812 , is an event which promises to be favorable to the revolution . Under the authority of the Cortes the Congress of Angostura was invited to open a negotiation for the settlement of differences between the parties , to which it was replied that they would willingly open the negotiation provided the acknowledgment of their independence was made its basis , but not otherwise . No facts are known to this Government to warrant the belief that any of the powers of Europe will take part in the contest , whence it may be inferred , considering all circumstances which must have weight in producing the result , that an adjustment will finally take place on the basis proposed by the colonies . To promote that result by friendly counsels with other powers , including Spain herself , has been the uniform policy of this Government . In looking to the internal concerns of our country you will , I am persuaded , derive much satisfaction from a view of the several objects to which , in the discharge of your official duties , your attention will be drawn . Among these none holds a more important place than the public revenue , from the direct operation of the power by which it is raised on the people , and by its influence in giving effect to every other power of the Government . The revenue depends on the resources of the country , and the facility by which the amount required is raised is a strong proof of the extent of the resources and of the efficiency of the Government . A few prominent facts will place this great interest in a just light before you . On 1815 09 30 , the funded and floating debt of the United States was estimated at 119 , 635 , 558 . If to this sum be added the amount of 5 stock subscribed to the Bank of the United States , the amount of Mississippi stock and of the stock which was issued subsequently to that date , and as afterwards liquidated , to 158 , 713 , 049 . On 1820 09 30 , it amounted to 91 , 993 , 883 , having been reduced in that interval by payments 66 , 879 , 165 . During this term the expenses of the Government of the United States were likewise defrayed in every branch of the civil , military , and naval establishments the public edifices in this city have been rebuilt with considerable additions extensive fortifications have been commenced , and are in a train of execution permanent arsenals and magazines have been erected in various parts of the Union our Navy has been considerably augmented , and the ordnance , munitions of war , and stores of the Army and Navy , which were much exhausted during the war , have been replenished . By the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the execution of such extensive and important operations in so short a time a just estimate may be formed of the great extent of our national resources . The demonstration is the more complete and gratifying when it is recollected that the direct tax and excise were repealed soon after the termination of the late war , and that the revenue applied to these purposes has been derived almost wholly from other sources . The receipts into the Treasury from every source to the 30th of September last have amounted to 16 , 794 , 107 . 66 , whilst the public expenditures to the same period amounted to 16 , 871 , 534 . 72 , leaving in the Treasury on that day a sum estimated at 1 . 95for the probable receipts of the following year I refer you to the statement which will be transmitted from the Treasury . The sum of 3M authorized to be raised by loan by an act of the last session of Congress has been obtained upon terms advantageous to the Government , indicating not only an increased confidence in the faith of the nation , but the existence of a large amount of capital seeking that mode of investment at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per annum . It is proper to add that there is now due to the Treasury for the sale of public lands 22 , 996 , 545 . In bringing this subject to view I consider it my duty to submit to Congress whether it may not be advisable to extend to the purchasers of these lands , in consideration of the unfavorable change which has occurred since the sales , a reasonable indulgence . It is known that the purchases were made when the price of every article had risen to its greatest height , and the installments are becoming due at a period of great depression . It is presumed that some plan may be devised by the wisdom of Congress , compatible with the public interest , which would afford great relief to these purchasers . Considerable progress has been made during the present season in examining the coast and its various bays and other inlets , in the collection of materials , and in the construction of fortifications for the defense of the Union at several of the positions at which it has been decided to erect such works . At Mobile Point and Dauphin Island , and at the Rigolets , leading to Lake Pontchartrain , materials to a considerable amount have been collected , and all the necessary preparations made for the commencement of the works . At Old Point Comfort , at the mouth of the James River , and at the Rip Rap , on the opposite shore in the Chesapeake Bay , materials to a vast amount have been collected and at the Old Point some progress has been made in the construction of the fortification , which is on a very extensive scale . The work at Fort Washington , on this river , will be completed early in the next spring , and that on the Pea Patch , in the Delaware , in the course of the next season . Fort Diamond , at the Narrows , in the harbor of Nwill be finished this year . The works at Boston , NBaltimore , Norfolk , Charleston , and Niagara have been in part repaired , and the coast of Nextending south to Cape Fear , has been examined , as have likewise other parts of the coast eastward of Boston . Great exertions have been made to push forward these works with the utmost dispatch possible but when their extent is considered , with the important purposes for which they are intended the defense of the whole coast , and , in consequence , of the whole interior and that they are to last for ages , it will be manifest that a well digested plan , founded on military principles , connecting the whole together , combining security with economy , could not be prepared without repeated examinations of the most exposed and difficult parts , and that it would also take considerable time to collect the materials at the several points where they would be required . From all the light that has been shed on this subject I am satisfied that every favorable anticipation which has been formed of this great undertaking will be verified , and that when completed it will afford very great if not complete protection to our Atlantic frontier in the event of another war protection sufficient to counterbalance in a single campaign with an enemy powerful at sea the expense of all these works , without taking into the estimate the saving of the lives of so many of our citizens , the protection of our towns and other property , or the tendency of such works to prevent war . Our military positions have been maintained at Belle Point , on the Arkansas , at Council Bluffs , on the Missouri , at Peters , on the Mississippi , and at Green Bay , on the upper Lakes . Commodious barracks have already been erected at most of these posts , with such works as were necessary for their defense . Progress has also been made in opening communications between them and in raising supplies at each for the support of the troops by their own labor , particularly those most remote . With the Indians peace has been preserved and a progress made in carrying into effect the act of Congress making an appropriation for their civilization , with the prospect of favorable results . As connected equally with both these objects , our trade with those tribes is thought to merit the attention of Congress . In their original state game is their sustenance and war their occupation , and if they find no employment from civilized powers they destroy each other . Left to themselves their extirpation is inevitable . By a judicious regulation of our trade with them we supply their wants , administer to their comforts , and gradually , as the game retires , draw them to us . By maintaining posts far in the interior we acquire a more thorough and direct control over them , without which it is confidently believed that a complete change in their manners can never be accomplished . By such posts , aided by a proper regulation of our trade with them and a judicious civil administration over them , to be provided for by law , we shall , it is presumed , be enabled not only to protect our own settlements from their savage incursions and preserve peace among the several tribes , but accomplish also the great purpose of their civilization . Considerable progress has also been made in the construction of ships of war , some of which have been launched in the course of the present year . Our peace with the powers on the coast of Barbary has been preserved , but we owe it altogether to the presence of our squadron in the Mediterranean . It has been found equally necessary to employ some of our vessels for the protection of our commerce in the Indian Sea , the Pacific , and along the Atlantic coast . The interests which we have depending in those quarters , which have been much improved of late , are of great extent and of high importance to the nation as well as to the parties concerned , and would undoubtedly suffer if such protection was not extended to them . In execution of the law of the last session for the suppression of the slave trade some of our public ships have also been employed on the coast of Africa , where several captures have already been made of vessels engaged in that disgraceful traffic .<speech_sep>Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives The view which I have now to present to you of our affairs , foreign and domestic , realizes the most sanguine anticipations which have been entertained of the public prosperity . If we look to the whole , our growth as a nation continues to be rapid beyond example if to the states which compose it , the same gratifying spectacle is exhibited . Our expansion over the vast territory within our limits has been great , without indicating any decline in those sections from which the emigration has been most conspicuous . We have daily gained strength by a native population in every quarter a population devoted to our happy system of government and cherishing the bond of union with internal affection . Experience has already shewn that the difference of climate and of industry , proceeding from that cause , inseparable from such vast domains , and which under other systems might have a repulsive tendency , can not fail to produce with us under wise regulations the opposite effect . What one portion wants the other may supply and this will be most sensibly felt by the parts most distant from each other , forming thereby a domestic market and an active intercourse between the extremes and throughout every portion of our Union . Thus by a happy distribution of power between the national and state governments , governments which rest exclusively on the sovereignty of the people and are fully adequate to the great purposes for which they were respectively instituted , causes which might otherwise lead to dismemberment operate powerfully to draw us closer together . In every other circumstance a correct view of the actual state of our union must be equally gratifying to our constituents . Our relations with foreign powers are of a friendly character , although certain interesting differences remain unsettled with some . Our revenue under the mild system of impost and tonnage continues to be adequate to all the purposes of the government . Our agriculture , commerce , manufactures , and navigation flourish . Our fortifications are advancing in the degree authorized by existing appropriations to maturity , and due progress is made in the augmentation of the Navy to the limit prescribed for it by law . For these blessings we owe to Almighty God , from whom we derive them , and with profound reverence , our most grateful and unceasing acknowledgments . In adverting to our relations with foreign powers , which are always an object of the highest importance , I have to remark that of the subjects which have been brought into discussion with them during the present administration some have been satisfactorily terminated , others have been suspended , to be resumed hereafter under circumstances more favorable to success , and others are still in negotiation , with the hope that they may be adjusted with mutual accommodation to the interests and to the satisfaction of the respective parties . It has been the invariable object of this government to cherish the most friendly relations with every power , and on principles and conditions which might make them permanent . A systematic effort has been made to place our commerce with each power on a footing of perfect reciprocity , to settle with each in a spirit of candor and liberality all existing differences , and to anticipate and remove so far as it might be practicable all causes of future variance . It having been stipulated by the seventh article of the convention of navigation and commerce which was concluded on 1822 06 24 , between the United States and France , that the said convention should continue in force for two years from the first of October of that year , and for an indefinite term afterwards , unless one of the parties should declare its intention to renounce it , in which event it should cease to operate at the end of six months from such declaration , and no such intention having been announced , the convention having been found advantageous to both parties , it has since remained , and still remains , in force . At the time when that convention was concluded many interesting subjects were left unsettled , and particularly our claim to indemnity for spoliations which were committed on our commerce in the late wars . For these interests and claims it was in the contemplation of the parties to make provision at a subsequent day by a more comprehensive and definitive treaty . The object has been duly attended to since by the executive , but as yet it has not been accomplished . It is hoped that a favorable opportunity will present itself for opening a negotiation which may embrace and arrange all existing differences and every other concern in which they have a common interest upon the accession of the present King of France , an event which has occurred since the close of the last session of Congress . With Great Britain our commercial intercourse rests on the same footing that it did at the last session . by the convention of 1815 , the commerce between the United States and the British dominions in Europe and the East Indies was arranged on a principle of reciprocity . That convention was confirmed and continued in force , with slight exceptions , by a subsequent treaty for the term of 10 years from 1818 10 20 , the date of the latter . The trade with the British colonies in the West Indies has not as yet been arranged , by treaty or otherwise , to our satisfaction . An approach to that result has been made by legislative acts , whereby many serious impediments which had been raised by the parties in defense of their respective claims were removed . An earnest desire exists , and has been manifested on the part of this government , to place the commerce with the colonies , likewise , on a footing of reciprocal advantage , and it is hoped that the British government , seeing the justice of the proposal and its importance to the colonies , will ere long accede to it . The commissioners who were appointed for the adjustment of the boundary between the territories of the United States and those of Great Britain , specified in the fifth article of the Treaty of Ghent , having disagreed in their decision , and both governments having agreed to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation between them , it is hoped that it may be satisfactorily adjusted in that mode . The boundary specified by the sixth article has been established by the decision of the commissioners . From the progress made in that provided for by the seventh , according to a report recently received , there is good cause to presume that it will be settled in the course of the ensuing year . It is a cause of serious regret that no arrangement has yet been finally concluded between the two governments to secure by joint cooperation the suppression of the slave trade . It was the object of the British government in the early stages of the negotiation to adopt a plan for the suppression which should include the concession of the mutual right of search by the ships of war of each party of the vessels of the other for suspected offenders . This was objected to by this government on the principle that as the right of search was a right of war of a belligerent toward a neutral power it might have an ill effect to extend it by treaty , to an offense which had been made comparatively mild , to a time of peace . Anxious , however , for the suppression of this trade , it was thought advisable , in compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives , founded on an act of Congress , to propose to the British government an expedient which should be free from that objection and more effectual for the object , by making it piratical . In that mode the enormity of the crime would place the offenders out of the protection of their government , and involve no question of search or other question between the parties touching their respective rights . It was believed , also , that it would completely suppress the trade in the vessels of both parties , and by their respective citizens and subjects in those of other powers , with whom it was hoped that the odium which would thereby be attached to it would produce a corresponding arrangement , and by means thereof its entire extirpation forever . A convention to this effect was concluded and signed in London on 1824 03 13 , by plenipotentiaries duly authorized by both governments , to the ratification of which certain obstacles have arisen which are not yet entirely removed . The difference between the parties still remaining has been reduced to a point not of sufficient magnitude , as is presumed , to be permitted to defeat an object so near to the heart of both nations and so desirable to the friends of humanity throughout the world . As objections , however , to the principle recommended by the House of Representatives , or at least to the consequences inseparable from it , and which are understood to apply to the law , have been raised , which may deserve a reconsideration of the whole subject , I have thought it proper to suspend the conclusion of a new convention until the definitive sentiments of Congress may be ascertained . The documents relating to the negotiation are with that intent submitted to your consideration . Our commerce with Sweden has been placed on a footing of perfect reciprocity by treaty , and with Russia , the Netherlands , Prussia , the free Hanseatic cities , the Dukedom of Oldenburg , and Sardinia by internal regulations on each side , founded on mutual agreement between the respective governments . The principles upon which the commercial policy of the United States is founded are to be traced to an early period . They are essentially connected with those upon which their independence was declared , and owe their origin to the enlightened men who took the lead in our affairs at that important epoch . They are developed in their first treaty of commerce with France of 1778 02 06 , and by a formal commission which was instituted immediately after the conclusion of their Revolutionary struggle , for the purpose of negotiating treaties of commerce with every European power . The first treaty of the United States with Prussia , which was negotiated by that commission , affords a signal illustration of those principles . The act of Congress of 1815 03 03 , adopted immediately after the return of a general peace , was a new overture to foreign nations to establish our commercial relations with them on the basis of free and equal reciprocity . That principle has pervaded all the acts of Congress and all the negotiations of the executive on the subject . A convention for the settlement of important questions in relation to the North West coast of this continent and its adjoining seas was concluded and signed at Petersburg on the 5th day of April last by the minister plenipotentiary of the United States and plenipotentiaries of the Imperial government of Russia . It will immediately be laid before the Senate for the exercise of the constitutional authority of that body with reference to its ratification . It is proper to add that the manner in which this negotiation was invited and conducted on the part of the Emperor has been very satisfactory . The great and extraordinary changes which have happened in the governments of Spain and Portugal within the last two years , without seriously affecting the friendly relations which under all of them have been maintained with those powers by the United States , have been obstacles to the adjustment of the particular subjects of discussion which have arisen with each . A resolution of the Senate adopted at their last session called for information as to the effect produced upon our relations with Spain by the recognition on the part of the United States of the independent South American governments . The papers containing that information are now communicated to Congress . A charge d affaires has been received from the independent government of Brazil . That country , heretofore a colonial possession of Portugal , had some years since been proclaimed by the Sovereign of Portugal himself an independent Kingdom . Since his return to Lisbon a revolution in Brazil has established a new government there with an imperial title , at the head of which is placed a prince , in whom the regency had been vested by the King at the time of his departure . There is reason to expect that by amicable negotiation the independence of Brazil will ere long be recognized by Portugal herself . With the remaining powers of Europe , with those on the coast of Barbary , and with all the new South American states our relations are of a friendly character . We have ministers plenipotentiary residing with the Republics of Colombia and Chile , and have received ministers of the same rank from Columbia , Guatemala , Buenos Aires , and Mexico . Our commercial relations with all those states are mutually beneficial and increasing . With the Republic of Colombia a treaty of commerce has been formed , of which a copy is received and the original daily expected . A negotiation for a like treaty would have been commenced with Buenos Aires had it not been prevented by the indisposition and lamented decease of Rodney , our minister there , and to whose memory the most respectful attention has been shewn by the government of that Republic . An advantageous alteration in our treaty with Tunis has been obtained by our consular agent residing there , the official document of which when received will be laid before the Senate . The attention of the government has been drawn with great solicitude to other subjects , and particularly to that relating to a state of maritime war , involving the relative rights of neutral and belligerent in such wars . Most of the difficulties which we have experienced and of the losses which we have sustained since the establishment of our independence have proceeded from the unsettled state of those rights and the extent to which the belligerent claim has been carried against the neutral party . It is impossible to look back on the occurrences of the late wars in Europe , and to behold the disregard which was paid to our rights as a neutral power , and the waste which was made of our commerce by the parties to those wars by various acts of their respective governments , and under the pretext by each that the other had set the example , without great mortification and a fixed purpose never to submit to the like in future . An attempt to remove those causes of possible variance by friendly negotiation and on just principles which should be applicable to all parties could , it was presumed , be viewed by none other than as a proof of an earnest desire to preserve those relations with every power . In the late war between France and Spain a crisis occurred in which it seemed probable that all controvertible principles involved in such wars might be brought into discussion and settled to the satisfaction of all parties . Propositions having this object in view have been made to the governments of Great Britain , France , Russia , and of other powers , which have been received in a friendly manner by all , but as yet no treaty has been formed with either for its accomplishment . The policy will , it is presumed , be persevered in , and in the hope that it may be successful . It will always be recollected that with one of the parties to those wars and from whom we received those injuries , we sought redress by war . From the other , by whose then reigning government our vessels were seized in port as well as at sea and their cargoes confiscated , indemnity has been expected , but has not yet been rendered . It was under the influence of the latter that our vessels were likewise seized by the governments of Spain , Holland , Denmark , Sweden , and Naples , and from whom indemnity has been claimed and is still expected , with the exception of Spain , by whom it has been rendered . With both parties we had abundant cause of war , but we had no alternative but to resist that which was most powerful at sea and pressed us nearest at home . With this all differences were settled by a treaty , founded on conditions fair and honorable to both , and which has been so far executed with perfect good faith . It has been earnestly hoped that the other would of its own accord , and from a sentiment of justice and conciliation , make to our citizens the indemnity to which they are entitled , and thereby remove from our relations any just cause of discontent on our side . It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the current year , exclusive of loans , will exceed 18 . 5 million , which , with the sum remaining in the Treasury at the end of the last year , amounting to 9 , 463 , 922 . 81 will , after discharging the current disbursements of the year , the interest on the public debt , and upward of 11 , 633 , 011 . 52 of the principal , leave a balance of more than 3 million in the Treasury on the first day of January next . A larger amount of the debt contracted during the late war , bearing an interest of 6 percent , becoming redeemable in the course of the ensuing year than could be discharged by the ordinary revenue , the act of the 26th of May authorized a loan of 5 million at 4 . 5 percent to meet the same . By this arrangement an annual saving will accrue to the public of 75 , 000 . Under the act of the 24th of May last a loan of 5 million was authorized , in order to meet the awards under the Florida treaty , which was negotiated at par with the Bank of the United States at 4 . 5 percent , the limit of interest fixed by the act . By this provision the claims of our citizens who had sustained so great a loss by spoliations , and from whom indemnity had been so long withheld , were promptly paid . For these advances the public will be amply repaid at no distant day by the sale of the lands in Florida . Of the great advantages resulting from the acquisition of the territory in other respects too high an estimate can not be formed . It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the year 1825 will be sufficient to meet the disbursements of the year , including the sum of 10 million , which is annually appropriated by the act of constituting the sinking fund to the payment of the principal and interest of the public debt . The whole amount of the public debt on the first of January next may be estimated at 86 million , inclusive of 2 . 5 million of the loan authorized by the act of the 26th of May last . In this estimate is included a stock of 7 million , issued for the purchase of that amount of the capital stock of the Bank of the United States , and which , as the stock of the bank still held by the government will at least be fully equal to its reimbursement , ought not to be considered as constituting a part of the public debt . Estimating , then , the whole amount of the public debt at 79 million and regarding the annual receipts and expenditures of the government , a well founded hope may be entertained that , should no unexpected event occur , the whole of the public debt may be discharged in the course of 10 years , and the government be left at liberty thereafter to apply such portion of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expenses to such other objects as may be most conducive to the public security and welfare . That the sums applicable to these objects will be very considerable may be fairly concluded when it is recollected that a large amount of the public revenue has been applied since the late war to the construction of the public buildings in this city to the erection of fortifications along the coast and of arsenals in different parts of the Union to the augmentation of the Navy to the extinguishment of the Indian title to large tracts of fertile territory to the acquisition of Florida to pensions to Revolutionary officers and soldiers , and to invalids of the late war . On many of these objects the expense will annually be diminished and cease at no distant period on most of them . On the 1917 01 01 , the public debt amounted to 123 , 491 , 965 . 16 , and , notwithstanding the large sums which have been applied to these objects , it has been reduced since that period 37 , 446 , 961 . 78 . The last portion of the public debt will be redeemable on 1835 01 01 , and , while there is the best reason to believe that the resources of the government will be continually adequate to such portions of it as may become due in the interval , it is recommended to Congress to seize every opportunity which may present itself to reduce the rate of interest on every part thereof . The high state of the public credit and the great abundance of money are at this time very favorable to such a result . It must be very gratifying to our fellow citizens to witness this flourishing state of the public finances when it is recollected that no burthen whatever has been imposed upon them . The military establishment in all its branches , in the performance of the various duties assigned to each , justifies the favorable view which was presented of the efficiency of its organization at the last session . All the appropriations have been regularly applied to the objects intended by Congress , and so far as the disbursements have been made the accounts have been rendered and settled without loss to the public . The condition of the Army itself , as relates to the officers and men , in science and discipline is highly respectable . The military academy , on which the Army essentially rests , and to which it is much indebted for this state of improvement , has attained , in comparison with any other institution of a like kind , a high degree of perfection . Experience , however , has shewn that the dispersed condition of the corps of artillery is unfavorable to the discipline of that important branch of the military establishment . To remedy this inconvenience , eleven companies have been assembled at the fortification erected at Old Point Comfort as a school for artillery instruction , with intention as they shall be perfected in the various duties of that service to order them to other posts , and , to supply their places with other companies for instruction in like manner . In this mode a complete knowledge of the science and duties of this arm will be extended throughout the whole corps of artillery . But to carry this object fully into effect will require the aid of Congress , to obtain which the subject is now submitted to your consideration . Of the progress which has been made in the construction of fortifications for the permanent defense of our maritime frontier , according to the plan decided on and to the extent of the existing appropriations , the report of the Secretary of War , which is herewith communicated , will give a detailed account . Their final completion can not fail to give great additional security to that frontier , and to diminish proportionably the expense of defending it in the event of war . The provisions in several acts of Congress of the last session for the improvement of the navigation of the Mississippi and the Ohio , of the harbor of Presqu isle , on Lake Erie , and the repair of the Plymouth beach are in a course of regular execution and there is reason to believe that the appropriation in each instance will be adequate to the object . To carry these improvements fully into effect , the superintendence of them has been assigned to officers of the Corps of Engineers . Under the act of 30th April last , authorizing the President to cause a survey to be made , with the necessary plans and estimates , of such roads and canals as he might deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view , or for the transportation of the mail , a board has been instituted , consisting of two distinguished officers of the Corps of Engineers and a distinguished civil engineer , with assistants , who have been actively employed in carrying into effect the object of the act . They have carefully examined the route between the Potomac and the Ohio rivers between the latter and Lake Erie between the Alleghany and the Susquehannah and the routes between the Delaware and the Raritan , Barnstable and Buzzards Bay , and between Boston Harbor and Narraganset Bay . Such portion of the Corps of Topographical Engineers as could be spared from the survey of the coast has been employed in surveying the very important route between the Potomac and the Ohio . Considerable progress has been made in it , but the survey can not be completed until the next season . It is gratifying to add , from the view already taken , that there is good cause to believe that this great national object may be fully accomplished . It is contemplated to commence early in the next season the execution of the other branch of the act that which relates to roads and with the survey of a route from this city , through the Southern states , to New Orleans , the importance of which can not be too highly estimated . All the officers of both the corps of engineers who could be spared from other services have been employed in exploring and surveying the routes for canals . to digest a plan for both objects for the great purposes specified will require a thorough knowledge of every part of our Union and of the relation of each part to the others and of all to the seat of the general government . For such a digest it will be necessary that the information be full , minute , and precise . With a view to these important objects , I submit to the consideration of the Congress the propriety of enlarging both the corps of engineers the military and topographical . It need scarcely be remarked that the more extensively these corps are engaged in the improvement of their country , in the execution of the powers of Congress , and in aid of the states in such improvements as lie beyond that limit , when such aid is desired , the happier the effect will be in many views of which the subject is perceptible . By profiting of their science the works will always be well executed , and by giving to the officers such employment our Union will derive all the advantage , in peace as well as in war , from their talents and services which they can afford . In this mode , also , the military will be incorporated with the civil , and unfounded and injurious distinctions and prejudices of every kind be done away . To the corps themselves this service can not fail to be equally useful , since by the knowledge they would thus acquire they would be eminently better qualified in the event of war for the great purposes for which they were instituted . Our relations with the Indian tribes within our limits have not been materially changed during the year . The hostile disposition evinced by certain tribes on the Missouri during the last year still continues , and has extended in some degree to those on the Upper Mississippi and the Upper Lakes . Several parties of our citizens have been plundered and murdered by those tribes . In order to establish relations of friendship with them , Congress at the last session made an appropriation for treaties with them and for the employment of a suitable military escort to accompany and attend the commissioners at the places appointed for the negotiations . This object has not been effected . The season was too far advanced when the appropriation was made and the distance too great to permit it , but measures have been taken , and all the preparations will be completed to accomplish it at an early period in the next season . Believing that the hostility of the tribes , particularly on the Upper Mississippi and the Lakes , is in no small degree owing to the wars which are carried on between the tribes residing in that quarter , measures have been taken to bring about a general peace among them , which , if successful , will not only tend to the security of our citizens , but be of great advantage to the Indians themselves . With the exception of the tribes referred to , our relations with all the others are on the same friendly footing , and it affords me great satisfaction to add that they are making steady advances in civilization and the improvement of their condition . Many of the tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized life . This desirable result has been brought about by the humane and persevering policy of the government , and particularly by means of the appropriation for the civilization of the Indians . There have been established under the provisions of this act 32 schools , containing 916 scholars , who are well instructed in several branches of literature , and likewise in agriculture and the ordinary arts of life . Under the appropriation to authorize treaties with the Creeks and Quaupaw Indians commissioners have been appointed and negotiations are now pending , but the result is not yet known . For more full information respecting the principle which has been adopted for carrying into effect the act of Congress authorizing surveys , with plans and estimates for canals and roads , and on every other branch of duty incident to the Department of War , I refer you to the report of the Secretary . The squadron in the Mediterranean has been maintained in the extent which was proposed in the report of the Secretary of the Navy of the last year , and has afforded to our commerce the necessary protection in that sea . Apprehending , however , that the unfriendly relations which have existed between Algiers and some of the powers of Europe might be extended to us , it has been thought expedient to augment the force there , and in consequence the North Carolina , a ship of the line , has been prepared , and will sail in a few days to join it . The force employed in the Gulf of Mexico and in the neighboring seas for the suppression of piracy has likewise been preserved essentially in the state in which it was during the last year . A persevering effort has been made for the accomplishment of that object , and much protection has thereby been afforded to our commerce , but still the practice is far from being suppressed . From every view which has been taken of the subject it is thought that it will be necessary rather to augment than to diminish our force in that quarter . There is reason to believe that the piracies now complained of are committed by bands of robbers who inhabit the land , and who , by preserving good intelligence with the towns and seizing favorable opportunities , rush forth and fall on unprotected merchant vessels , of which they make an easy prey . The pillage thus taken they carry to their lurking places , and dispose of afterwards at prices tending to seduce the neighboring population . This combination is understood to be of great extent , and is the more to be deprecated because the crime of piracy is often attended with the murder of the crews , these robbers knowing if any survived their lurking places would be exposed and they be caught and punished . That this atrocious practice should be carried to such extent is cause of equal surprise and regret . It is presumed that it must be attributed to the relaxed and feeble state of the local governments , since it is not doubted , from the high character of the governor of Cuba , who is well known and much respected here , that if he had the power he would promptly suppress it . Whether those robbers should be pursued on the land , the local authorities be made responsible for these atrocities , or any other measure be resorted to to suppress them , is submitted to the consideration of Congress . In execution of the laws for the suppression of the slave trade a vessel has been occasionally sent from that squadron to the coast of Africa with orders to return thence by the usual track of the slave ships , and to seize any of our vessels which might be engaged in that trade . None have been found , and it is believed that none are thus employed . It is well known , however , that the trade still exists under other flags . The health of our squadron while at Thompsons Island has been much better during the present than it was the last season . Some improvements have been made and others are contemplated there which , it is believed , will have a very salutary effect . On the Pacific , our commerce has much increased , and on that coast , as well as on that sea , the United States have many important interests which require attention and protection . It is thought that all the considerations which suggested the expediency of placing a squadron on that sea operate with augmented force for maintaining it there , at least in equal extent . For detailed information respecting the state of our maritime force on each sea , the improvement necessary to be made on either in the organization of the naval establishment generally , and of the laws for its better government I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy , which is herewith communicated . The revenue of the Post Office Department has received a considerable augmentation in the present year . The current receipts will exceed the expenditures , although the transportation of the mail within the year has been much increased . A report of the Postmaster General , which is transmitted , will furnish in detail the necessary information respecting the administration and present state of this department . In conformity with a resolution of Congress of the last session , an invitation was given to General Lafayette to visit the United States , with an assurance that a ship of war should attend at any port of France which he might designate , to receive and convey him across the Atlantic , whenever it might be convenient for him to sail . He declined the offer of the public ship from motives of delicacy , but assured me that he had long intended and would certainly visit our Union in the course of the present year . In August last he arrived at New York , where he was received with the warmth of affection and gratitude to which his very important and disinterested services and sacrifices in our Revolutionary struggle so eminently entitled him . A corresponding sentiment has since been manifested in his favor throughout every portion of our Union , and affectionate invitations have been given him to extend his visits to them . To these he has yielded all the accommodation in his power . At every designated point of rendezvous the whole population of the neighboring country has been assembled to greet him , among whom it has excited in a peculiar manner the sensibility of all to behold the surviving members of our Revolutionary contest , civil and military , who had shared with him in the toils and dangers of the war , many of them in a decrepit state . A more interesting spectacle , it is believed , was never witnessed , because none could be founded on purer principles , none proceed from higher or more disinterested motives . That the feelings of those who had fought and bled with him in a common cause should have been much excited was natural . There are , however , circumstances attending these interviews which pervaded the whole community and touched the breasts of every age , even the youngest among us . There was not an individual present who had not some relative who had not partaken in those scenes , nor an infant who had not heard the relation of them . But the circumstance which was most sensibly felt , and which his presence brought forcibly to the recollection of all , was the great cause in which we were engaged and the blessings which we have derived from our success in it . The struggle was for independence and liberty , public and personal , and in this we succeeded . The meeting with one who had borne so distinguished a part in that great struggle , and from such lofty and disinterested motives , could not fail to affect profoundly every individual and of every age . It is natural that we should all take a deep interest in his future welfare , as we do . His high claims on our union are felt , and the sentiment universal that they should be met in a generous spirit . Under these impressions I invite your attention to the subject , with a view that , regarding his very important services , losses , and sacrifices , a provision may be made and tendered to him which shall correspond with the sentiments and be worthy the character of the American people . In turning our attention to the condition of the civilized world , in which the United States have always taken a deep interest , it is gratifying to see how large a portion of it is blessed with peace . The only wars which now exist within that limit are those between Turkey and Greece , in Europe , and between Spain and the new governments , our neighbors , in this hemisphere . In both these wars the cause of independence , of liberty and humanity , continues to prevail . The success of Greece , when the relative population of the contending parties is considered , commands our admiration and applause , and that it has had a similar effect with the neighboring powers is obvious . The feeling of the whole civilized world is excited in a high degree in their favor . May we not hope that these sentiments , winning on the hearts of their respective governments , may lead to a more decisive result that they may produce an accord among them to replace Greece on the ground which she formerly held , and to which her heroic exertions at this day so eminently entitle her With respect to the contest to which our neighbors are a party , it is evident that Spain as a power is scarcely felt in it . These new states had completely achieved their independence before it was acknowledged by the United States , and they have since maintained it with little foreign pressure . The disturbances which have appeared in certain portions of that vast territory have proceeded from internal causes , which had their origin in their former governments and have not yet been thoroughly removed . It is manifest that these causes are daily losing their effect , and that these new states are settling down under governments elective and representative in every branch , similar to our own . In this course we ardently wish them to persevere , under a firm conviction that it will promote their happiness . In this , their career , however , we have not interfered , believing that every people have a right to institute for themselves the government which , in their judgment , may suit them best . Our example is before them , of the good effect of which , being our neighbors , they are competent judges , and to their judgment we leave it , in the expectation that other powers will pursue the same policy . The deep interest which we take in their independence , which we have acknowledged , and in their enjoyment of all the rights incident thereto , especially in the very important one of instituting their own governments , has been declared , and is known to the world . Separated as we are from Europe by the great Atlantic Ocean , we can have no concern in the wars of the European governments nor in the causes which produce them . The balance of power between them , into whichever scale it may turn in its various vibrations , can not affect us . It is the interest of the United States to preserve the most friendly relations with every power and on conditions fair , equal , and applicable to all . But in regard to our neighbors our situation is different . It is impossible for the European governments to interfere in their concerns , especially in those alluded to , which are vital , without affecting us indeed , the motive which might induce such interference in the present state of the war between the parties , if a war it may be called , would appear to be equally applicable to us . It is gratifying to know that some of the powers with whom we enjoy a very friendly intercourse , and to whom these views have been communicated , have appeared to acquiesce in them . The augmentation of our population with the expansion of our union and increased number of states have produced effects in certain branches of our system which merit the attention of Congress . Some of our arrangements , and particularly the judiciary establishment , were made with a view to the original 13 states only . Since then the United States have acquired a vast extent of territory eleven new states have been admitted into the Union , and territories have been laid off for three others , which will likewise be admitted at no distant day . An organization of the Supreme Court which assigns the judges any portion of the duties which belong to the inferior , requiring their passage over so vast a space under any distribution of the states that may now be made , if not impracticable in the execution , must render it impossible for them to discharge the duties of either branch with advantage to the Union . The duties of the Supreme Court would be of great importance if its decisions were confined to the ordinary limits of other tribunals , but when it is considered that this court decides , and in the last resort , on all the great questions which arise under our Constitution , involving those between the United states individually , between the states and the United States , and between the latter and foreign powers , too high an estimate of their importance can not be formed . The great interests of the nation seem to require that the judges of the Supreme Court should be exempted from every other duty than those which are incident to that high trust . The organization of the inferior courts would of course be adapted to circumstances . It is presumed that such an one might be formed as would secure an able and faithful discharge of their duties , and without any material augmentation of expense . The condition of the aborigines within our limits , and especially those who are within the limits of any of the states , merits likewise particular attention . Experience has shown that unless the tribes be civilized they can never be incorporated into our system in any form whatever . it has likewise shown that in the regular augmentation of our population with the extension of our settlements their situation will become deplorable , if their extinction is not menaced . Some well digested plan which will rescue them from such calamities is due to their rights , to the rights of humanity , and to the honor of the nation . Their civilization is indispensable to their safety , and this can be accomplished only by degrees . The process must commence with the infant state , through whom some effect may be wrought on the parental . Difficulties of the most serious character present themselves to the attainment of this very desirable result on the territory on which they now reside . To remove them from it by force , even with a view to their own security and happiness , would be revolting to humanity and utterly unjustifiable . Between the limits of our present states and territories and the Rocky Mountains and Mexico there is a vast territory to which they might be invited with inducements which might be successful . It is thought if that territory should be divided into districts by previous agreement with the tribes now residing there and civil governments be established in each , with schools for every branch of instruction in literature and the arts of civilized life , that all the tribes now within our limits might gradually be drawn there . The execution of this plan would necessarily be attended with expense , and that not inconsiderable , but it is doubted whether any other can be devised which would be less liable to that objection or more likely to succeed . In looking to the interests which the United States have on the Pacific Ocean and on the western coast of this continent , the propriety of establishing a military post at the mouth of the Columbia River , or at some other point in that quarter within our acknowledged limits , is submitted to the consideration of Congress . Our commerce and fisheries on that sea and along the coast have much increased and are increasing . It is thought that a military post , to which our ships of war might resort , would afford protection to every interest , and have a tendency to conciliate the tribes to the Northwest , with whom our trade is extensive . It is thought also that by the establishment of such a post the intercourse between our Western states and territories and the Pacific and our trade with the tribes residing in the interior on each side of the Rocky Mountains would be essentially promoted . To carry this object into effect the appropriation of an adequate sum to authorize the employment of a frigate , with an officer of the Corps of Engineers , to explore the mouth of the Columbia River and the coast contiguous thereto , to enable the executive to make such establishment at the most suitable point , is recommended to Congress . It is thought that attention is also due to the improvement of this city . The communication between the public buildings and in various other parts and the grounds around those buildings require it . It is presumed also that the completion of the canal from the Tiber to the Eastern Branch would have a very salutary effect . Great exertions have been made and expenses incurred by the citizens in improvements of various kinds but those which are suggested belong exclusively to the government , or are of a nature to require expenditures beyond their resources . The public lots which are still for sale would , it is not doubted , be more than adequate for these purposes . From the view above presented it is manifest that the situation of the United States is in the highest degree prosperous and happy . There is no object which as a people we can desire which we do not possess or which is not within our reach . Blessed with governments the happiest which the world ever knew , with no distinct orders in society or divided interests in any portion of the vast territory over which their dominion extends , we have every motive to cling together which can animate a virtuous and enlightened people . The great object is to preserve these blessings , and to hand them down to the latest posterity . Our experience ought to satisfy us that our progress under the most correct and provident policy will not be exempt from danger . Our institutions form an important epoch in the history of the civilized world . On their preservation and in their utmost purity everything will depend . Extending as our interests do to every part of the inhabited globe and to every sea to which our citizens are carried by their industry and enterprise , to which they are invited by the wants of others , and have a right to go , we must either protect them in the enjoyment of their rights or abandon them in certain events to waste and desolation . Our attitude is highly interesting as relates to other powers , and particularly to our southern neighbors . We have duties to perform WRT all to which we must be faithful . To every kind of danger we should pay the most vigilant and unceasing attention , remove the cause where it may be practicable , and be prepared to meet it when inevitable . Against foreign danger the policy of the government seems to be already settled . The events of the late war admonished us to make our maritime frontier impregnable by a well digested chain of fortifications , and to give efficient protection to our commerce by augmenting our Navy to a certain extent , which has been steadily pursued , and which it is incumbent upon us to complete as soon as circumstances will permit . In the event of war it is on the maritime frontier that we shall be assailed . It is in that quarter , therefore , that we should be prepared to meet the attack . It is there that our whole force will be called into action to prevent the destruction of our towns and the desolation and pillage of the interior . To give full effect to this policy great improvements will be indispensable . Access to those works by every practicable communication should be made easy and in every direction . The intercourse between every part of our union should also be promoted and facilitated by the exercise of those powers which may comport with a faithful regard to the great principles of our Constitution . With respect to internal causes , those great principles point out with equal certainty the policy to be pursued . Resting on the people as our governments do , state and national , with well defined powers , it is of the highest importance that they severally keep within the limits prescribed to them . Fulfilling that sacred duty , it is of equal importance that the movement between them be harmonious , and in case of any disagreement , should any such occur , a calm appeal be made to the people , and that their voice be heard and promptly obeyed . Both governments being instituted for the common good , we can not fail to prosper while those who made them are attentive to the conduct of their representatives and control their measures . In the pursuit of these great objects let a generous spirit and national views and feelings be indulged , and let every part recollect that by cherishing that spirit and improving the condition of the others in what relates to their welfare the general interest will not only be promoted , but the local advantage be reciprocated by all . I can not conclude this communication , the last of the kind which I shall have to make , without recollecting with great sensibility and heart felt gratitude the many instances of the public confidence and the generous support which I have received from my fellow citizens in the various trusts with which I have been honored . Having commenced my service in early youth , and continued it since with few and short intervals , I have witnessed the great difficulties to which our union has been surmounted . From the present prosperous and happy state I derive a gratification which I can not express . That these blessings may be preserved and perpetuated will be the object of my fervent and unceasing prayers to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe .<speech_sep>Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Many causes unite to make your present meeting peculiarly interesting to out constituents . The operation of our laws on the various subjects to which they apply , with the amendments which they occasionally require , imposes annually an important duty on the representatives of a free people . Our system has happily advanced to such maturity that I am not aware that your cares in that respect will be augmented . Other causes exist which are highly interesting to the whole civilized world and to no portion of it more so , in certain views , than to the United States . Of these causes and of their bearing on the interests of our union I shall communicate the sentiments which I have formed with that freedom which a sense of duty dictates . It is proper , however , to invite your attention in the first instance to those concerns respecting which legislative provision is thought to be particularly urgent . On the 24th of June last a convention of navigation and commerce was concluded in this city between the United States and France by ministers duly authorized for the purpose . The sanction of the executive having been given to this convention under a conviction that , taking all its stipulations into view , it rested essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage , I deemed it my duty , in compliance with the authority vested in the executive by the second section of the act of the last session of the 6th of May , concerning navigation , to suspend by proclamation until the end of the next session of Congress the operation of the act entitled An act to impose a new tonnage duty on French ships and vessels , and for other purposes , and to suspend likewise all other duties on French vessels or the goods imported in them which exceeded the duties on American vessels and on similar goods imported in them . I shall submit this convention forthwith to the Senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification . Since your last session the prohibition which had been imposed on the commerce between the United States and the British colonies in the West Indies and on this continent has likewise been removed . Satisfactory evidence having been adduced that the ports of those colonies had been opened to the vessels of the United States by an act of the British Parliament bearing date on the 24th of June last , on the conditions specified therein , I deemed it proper , in compliance with the provision of the first section of the act of the last session above recited , to declare , by proclamation bearing date on the 24th of August last , that the ports of the United States should thenceforward and until the end of the next session of Congress be opened to the vessels of Great Britain employed in that trade , under the limitation specified in that proclamation . A doubt was entertained whether the act of Congress applied to the British colonies on this continent as well as to those in the West Indies , but as the act of Parliament opened the intercourse equally with both , and it was the manifest intention of Congress , as well as the obvious policy of the United States , that the provisions of the act of Parliament should be met in equal extent on the part of the United States , and as also the act of Congress was supposed to vest in the President some discretion in the execution of it , I thought it advisable to give it a corresponding construction . Should the constitutional sanction of the Senate be given to the ratification of the convention with France , legislative provisions will be necessary to carry it fully into effect , as it likewise will be to continue in force , on such conditions as may be deemed just and proper , the intercourse which has been opened between the United States and the British colonies . Every light in the possession of the executive will in due time be communicated on both subjects . Resting essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage , it has been the object of the executive in transactions with other powers to meet the propositions of each with a liberal spirit , believing that thereby the interest of our country would be most effectually promoted . This course has been systematically pursued in the late occurrences with France and Great Britain , and in strict accord with the views of the legislature . A confident hope is entertained that by the arrangement thus commenced with each all differences respecting navigation and commerce with the dominions in question will be adjusted , and a solid foundation be laid for an active and permanent intercourse which will prove equally advantageous to both parties . The decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia on the question submitted to him by the United States and Great Britain , concerning the construction of the first article of the Treaty of Ghent , has been received . A convention has since been concluded between the parties , under the mediation of His Imperial Majesty , to prescribe the mode by which that article shall be carried into effect in conformity with that decision . I shall submit this convention to the Senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification , and , if obtained , shall immediately bring the subject before Congress for such provisions as may require the interposition of the legislature . In compliance with an act of the last session a territorial government has been established in Florida on the principles of our system . By this act the inhabitants are secured in the full enjoyment of their rights and liberties , and to admission into the Union , with equal participation in the government with the original states on the conditions heretofore prescribed to other territories . By a clause in the ninth article of the treaty with Spain , by which that territory was ceded to the United States , it is stipulated that satisfaction shall be made for the injuries , if any , which by process of law shall be established to have been suffered by the Spanish officers and individual Spanish inhabitants by the late operations of our troops in Florida . No provision having yet been made to carry that stipulation into effect , it is submitted to the consideration of Congress whether it will not be proper to vest the competent power in the district court at Pensacola , or in some tribunal to be specially organized for the purpose . The fiscal operations of the year have been more successful than had been anticipated at the commencement of the last session of Congress . The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year have exceeded the sum of 14 . 745 million . The payments made at the Treasury during the same period have exceeded 12 . 279 million , leaving the Treasury on the 30th day of September last , including 1 , 168 , 592 . 24 which were in the Treasury on the first day of January last , a sum exceeding 4 . 128 million . Besides discharging all demands for the current service of the year , including the interest and reimbursement of the public debt , the 6 percent stock of 1796 , amounting to 80 , 000 , has been redeemed . It is estimated that , after defraying the current expenses of the present quarter and redeeming the 2 million of 6 percent stock of 1820 , there will remain in the Treasury on the first of January next nearly 3 million . It is estimated that the gross amount of duties which have been secured from the first of January to the 30th of September last has exceeded 19 . 5 million , and the amount for the whole year will probably not fall short of 23 million . Of the actual force in service under the present military establishment , the posts at which it is stationed , and the condition of each post , a report from the Secretary of War which is now communicated will give a distinct idea . By like reports the state of the academy at West Point will be seen , as will be the progress which has been made on the fortifications along the coast and at the national armories and arsenals . The organization of the several corps composing the Army is such as to admit its expansion to a great extent in case of emergency , the officers carrying with them all the light which they possess to the new corps to which they might be appointed . With the organization of the staff there is equal cause to be satisfied . By the concentration of every branch with its chief in this city , in the presence of the department , and with a grade in the chief military station to keep alive and cherish a military spirit , the greatest promptitude in the execution of orders , with the greatest economy and efficiency , are secured . The same view is taken of the military academy . Good order is preserved in it , and the youth are well instructed in every science connected with the great objects of the institution . They are also well trained and disciplined in the practical parts of the profession . It has been always found difficult to control the ardor inseparable from that early age in such manner as to give it a proper direction . The rights of manhood are too often claimed prematurely , in pressing which too far the respect which is due to age and the obedience necessary to a course of study and instruction in every such institution are sometimes lost sight of . The great object to be accomplished is the restraint of that ardor by such wise regulations and government as , by directing all the energies of the youthful mind to the attainment of useful knowledge , will keep it within a just subordination and at the same time elevate it to the highest purposes . This object seems to be essentially obtained in this institution , and with great advantage to the union . The military academy forms the basis , in regard to science , on which the military establishment rests . It furnishes annually , after due examination and on the report of the academic staff , many well informed youths to fill the vacancies which occur in the several corps of the Army , while others who retire to private life carry with them such attainments as , under the right reserved to the several states to appoint the officers and to train the militia , will enable them , by affording a wider field for selection , to promote the great object of the power vested in Congress of providing for the organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia . Thus by the mutual and harmonious cooperation of the two governments in the execution of a power divided between them , an object always to be cherished , the attainment of a great result , on which our liberties may depend , can not fail to be secured . I have to add that in proportion as our regular force is small should the instruction and discipline of the militia , the great resource on which we rely , be pushed to the utmost extent that circumstances will admit . A report from the Secretary of the Navy will communicate the progress which has been made in the construction of vessels of war , with other interesting details respecting the actual state of the affairs of that department . It has been found necessary for the protection of our commerce to maintain the usual squadrons on the Mediterranean , the Pacific , and along the Atlantic coast , extending the cruises of the latter into the West Indies , where piracy , organized into a system , has preyed on the commerce of every country trading thither . A cruise has also been maintained on the coast of Africa , when the season would permit , for the suppression of the slave trade , and orders have been given to the commanders of all our public ships to seize our own vessels , should they find any engaging in that trade , and to bring them in for adjudication . In the West Indies piracy is of recent date , which may explain the cause why other powers have not combined against it . By the documents communicated it will be seen that the efforts of the United States to suppress it have had a very salutary effect . The benevolent provision of the act under which the protection has been extended alike to the commerce of other nations can not fail to be duly appreciated by them . In compliance with the act of the last session entitled An act to abolish the United States trading establishments , agents were immediately appointed and instructed , under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury , to close the business of the trading houses among the Indian tribes and to settle the accounts of the factors and subfactors engaged in that trade , and to execute in all other respects the injunction of that act in the mode prescribed therein . A final report of their proceedings shall be communicated to Congress as soon as it is received . It is with great regret I have to state that a serious malady has deprived us of many valuable citizens of Pensacola and checked the progress of some of those arrangements which are important to the territory . This effect has been sensibly felt in respect to the Indians who inhabit that territory , consisting of the remnants of the several tribes who occupy the middle ground between Augustine and Pensacola , with extensive claims but undefined boundaries . Although peace is preserved with those Indians , yet their position and claims tend essentially to interrupt the intercourse between the eastern and western parts of the territory , on which our inhabitants are principally settled . It is essential to the growth and prosperity of the territory , as well as to the interests of the Union , that those Indians should be removed , by special compact with them , to some other position or concentration within narrower limits where they are . With the limited means in the power of the executive , instructions were given to the Governor to accomplish this object so far as it might be practicable , which was prevented by the distressing malady referred to . To carry it fully into effect in either mode additional funds will be necessary , to the provision of which the powers of Congress are competent . With a view to such provision as may be deemed proper , the subject is submitted to your consideration , and in the interim further proceedings are suspended . It appearing that so much of the act entitled An act regulating the staff of the Army , which passed on 1818 04 14 , as relates to the commissariat will expire in April next , and the practical operation of that department having evinced its great utility , the propriety of its renewal is submitted to your consideration . The view which has been taken of the probable productiveness of the lead mines , connected with the importance of the material to the public defense , makes it expedient that they should be managed with peculiar care . It is therefore suggested whether it will not comport with the public interest to provide by law for the appointment of an agent skilled in mineralogy to superintend them , under the direction of the proper department . It is understood that the Cumberland road , which was constructed at great expense , has already suffered from the want of that regular superintendence and of those repairs which are indispensable to the preservation of such a work . This road is of incalculable advantage in facilitating the intercourse between the Western and the Atlantic states . Through the whole country from the northern extremity of Lake Erie to the Mississippi , and from all the waters which empty into each , finds and easy and direct communication to the seat of government , and thence to the Atlantic . The facility which it affords to all military and commercial operations , and also to those of the Post Office Department , can not be estimated too highly . This great work is likewise an ornament and an honor to the nation . Believing that a competent power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement has not been granted to Congress , but that such a power , confined to great national purposes and with proper limitations , would be productive of eminent advantage to our union , I have thought it advisable that an amendment of the Constitution to that effect should be recommended to the several states . A bill which assumed the right to adopt and execute such a system having been presented for my signature at the last session , I was compelled , from the view which I had taken of the powers of the general government , to negative it , on which occasion I thought it proper to communicate the sentiments which I had formed , on mature consideration , on the whole subject . To that communication , in all the views in which the great interest to which it relates may be supposed to merit your attention , I have now to refer . Should Congress , however , deem it improper to recommend such an amendment , they have , according to my judgment , the right to keep the road in repair by providing for the superintendence of it and appropriating the money necessary for repairs . Surely if they had the right to appropriate money to make the road they have a right to appropriate it to preserve the road from ruin . From the exercise of this power no danger is to be apprehended . Under our happy system the people are the sole and exclusive fountain of power . Each government originates from them , and to them alone , each to its proper constituents , are they respectively and solely responsible for the faithful discharge of their duties within their constitutional limits and that the people will confine their public agents of every station to the strict line of their constitutional duties there is no cause of doubt . Having , however , communicated my sentiments to Congress at the last session fully in the document to which I have referred , respecting the right of appropriation as distinct from the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory in question , I deem it improper to enlarge on the subject here . From the best information I have been able to obtain it appears that our manufactures , though depressed immediately after the peace , have considerably increased , and are still increasing , under the encouragement given them by the tariff of 1816 and by subsequent laws . Satisfied I am , whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce , provided all nations would concur in it and it was not liable to be interrupted by war , which has never occurred and can not be expected , that there are other strong reasons applicable to our situation and relations with other countries which impose on us the obligation to cherish and sustain our manufactures . Satisfied , however , I likewise am that the interest of every part of our Union , even of those most benefitted by manufactures , requires that this subject should be touched with the greatest caution , and a critical knowledge of the effect to be produced by the slightest change . On full consideration of the subject in all its relations I am persuaded that a further augmentation may now be made of the duties on certain foreign articles in favor of our own and without affecting injuriously any other interest . For more precise details I refer you to the communications which were made to Congress during the last session . So great was the amount of accounts for moneys advanced during the late war , in addition to others of a previous date which in the regular operations of the government necessarily remained unsettled , that it required a considerable length of time for their adjustment . By a report from the first Comptroller of the Treasury it appears that on 1817 03 04 , the accounts then unsettled amounted to 103 , 068 , 876 . 41 , of which on 1922 09 30 , 93 , 175 , 396 . 56 had been settled , leaving on that day a balance unsettled of 9 , 893 , 479 . 85 . That there have been drawn from the Treasury , in paying the public debt and sustaining the government in all its operations and disbursements , since 1817 03 04 , 157 , 199 , 380 . 96 , the accounts for which have been settled to the amount of 137 , 501 , 451 . 12 , leaving a balance unsettled of 19 , 697 , 929 . 84 . for precise details respecting each of these balances I refer to the report of the Comptroller and the documents which accompany it . From this view it appears that our commercial differences with France and Great Britain have been placed in a train of amicable arrangement on conditions fair and honorable in both instances to each party that our finances are in a very productive state , our revenue being at present fully competent to all the demands upon it that our military force is well organized in all its branches and capable of rendering the most important service in case of emergency that its number will admit of that due progress has been made , under existing appropriations , in the construction of fortifications and in the operations of the Ordnance Department that due progress has in like manner been made in the construction of ships of war that our Navy is in the best condition , felt and respected in every sea in which it is employed for the protection of our commerce that our manufactures have augmented in amount and improved in quality that great progress has been made in the settlement of accounts and in the recovery of the balances due by individuals , and that the utmost economy is secured and observed in every department of the administration . Other objects will likewise claim your attention , because from the station which the United States hold as a member of the great community of nations they have rights to maintain , duties to perform , and dangers to encounter . A strong hope was entertained that peace would ere this have been concluded between Spain and the independent governments south of the United States in this hemisphere . Long experience having evinced the competency of those governments to maintain the independence which they had declared , it was presumed that the considerations which induced their recognition by the United States would have had equal weight with other powers , and that Spain herself , yielding to those magnanimous feelings of which her history furnishes so many examples , would have terminated on that basis a controversy so unavailing and at the same time so destructive . We still cherish the hope that this result will not long be postponed . Sustaining our neutral position and allowing to each party while the war continues equal rights , it is incumbent on the United States to claim of each with equal rigor the faithful observance of our rights according to the well known law of nations . From each , therefore , a like cooperation is expected in the suppression of the piratical practice which has grown out of this war and of blockades of extensive coasts on both seas , which , considering the small force employed to sustain them , have not the slightest foundation to rest on . Europe is still unsettled , and although the war long menaced between Russia and Turkey has not broken out , there is no certainty that the differences between those powers will be amicably adjusted . It is impossible to look to the oppressions of the country respecting which those differences arose without being deeply affected . The mention of Greece fills the mind with the most exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosoms the best feelings of which our nature is susceptible . Superior skill and refinement in the arts , heroic gallantry in action , disinterested patriotism , enthusiastic zeal and devotion in favor of public and personal liberty are associated with our recollections of ancient Greece . That such a country should have been overwhelmed and so long hidden , as it were , from the world under a gloomy despotism has been a cause of unceasing and deep regret to generous minds for ages past . It was natural , therefore , that the reappearance of those people in their original character , contending in favor of their liberties , should produce that great excitement and sympathy in their favor which have been so signally displayed throughout the United States . A strong hope is entertained that these people will recover their independence and resume their equal station among the nations of the earth . A great effort has been made in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the people , and it must be very consoling to all benevolent minds to see the extraordinary moderation with which it has been conducted . That it may promote the happiness of both nations is the ardent wish of this whole people , to the expression of which we confine ourselves for whatever may be the feelings or sentiments which every individual under our government has a right to indulge and express , it is nevertheless a sacred maxim , equally with the government and people , that the destiny of every independent nation in what relates to such improvements of right belongs and ought to be left exclusively to themselves . Whether we reason from the late wars or from those menacing symptoms which now appear in Europe , it is manifest that if a convulsion should take place in any of those countries it will proceed from causes which have no existence and are utterly unknown in these states , in which there is but one order , that of the people , to whom the sovereignty exclusively belongs . Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread Exempt as we are from these causes , our internal tranquillity is secure and distant as we are from the troubled scene , and faithful to first principles in regard to other powers , we might reasonably presume that we should not be molested by them . This , however , ought not to be calculated on as certain . Unprovoked injuries are often inflicted and even the peculiar felicity of our situation might with some be a cause for excitement and aggression . The history of the late wars in Europe furnishes a complete demonstration that no system of conduct , however correct in principle , can protect neutral powers from injury from any party that a defenseless position and distinguished love of peace are the surest invitations to war , and that there is no way to avoid it other than by being always prepared and willing for just cause to meet it . If there be a people on earth whose more especial duty it is to be at all times prepared to defend the rights with which they are blessed , and to surpass all others in sustaining the necessary burthens , and in submitting to sacrifices to make such preparations , it is undoubtedly the people of these states . When we see that a civil war of the most frightful character rages from the Adriatic to the Black Sea that strong symptoms of war appear in other parts , proceeding from causes which , should it break out , may become general and be of long duration that the war still continues between Spain and the independent governments , her late provinces , in this hemisphere that it is likewise menaced between Portugal and Brazil , in consequence of the attempt of the latter to dismember itself from the former , and that a system of piracy of great extent is maintained in the neighboring seas , which will require equal vigilance and decision to suppress it , the reasons for sustaining the attitude which we now hold and for pushing forward all our measures of defense with the utmost vigor appear to me to acquire new force . The United States owe to the world a great example , and , by means thereof , to the cause of liberty and humanity a generous support . They have so far succeeded to the satisfaction of the virtuous and enlightened of every country . There is no reason to doubt that their whole movement will be regulated by a sacred regard to principle , all our institutions being founded on that basis . The ability to support our own cause under any trial to which it may be exposed is the great point on which the public solicitude rests . It has been often charged against free governments that they have neither the foresight nor the virtue to provide at the proper season for great emergencies that their course is improvident and expensive that war will always find them unprepared , and , whatever may be its calamities , that its terrible warnings will be disregarded and forgotten as soon as peace returns . I have full confidence that this charge so far as relates to the United States will be shewn to be utterly destitute of truth .<speech_sep>
