To the Senate and House of Representatives Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war , our people rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing degree of prosperity , evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded . Manufacture has been productive , agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant returns , labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded , revenue legislation passed by the present Congress has increased the Treasury s receipts to the amount estimated by its authors , the finances of the Government have been successfully administered and its credit advanced to the first rank , while its currency has been maintained at the world s highest standard . Military service under a common flag and for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section of the country . A review of the relation of the United States to other powers , always appropriate , is this year of primary importance in view of the momentous issues which have arisen , demanding in one instance the ultimate determination by arms and involving far reaching consequences which will require the earnest attention of the Congress . In my last annual message very full consideration was given to the question of the duty of the Government of the United States toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem with which we were then called upon to deal . The considerations then advanced and the exposition of the views therein expressed disclosed my sense of the extreme gravity of the situation . Setting aside as logically unfounded or practically inadmissible the recognition of the Cuban insurgents as belligerents , the recognition of the independence of Cuba , neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants , intervention in favor of one or the other party , and forcible annexation of the island , I concluded it was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of reform to which she had become irrevocably committed . Within a few weeks previously she had announced comprehensive plans which it was confidently asserted would be efficacious to remedy the evils so deeply affecting our own country , so injurious to the true interests of the mother country as well as to those of Cuba , and so repugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity . The ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the pacification of Cuba . The autonomous administrations set up in the capital and some of the principal cities appeared not to gain the favor of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend their influence to the large extent of territory held by the insurgents , while the military arm , obviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion , continued many of the most objectionable and offensive policies of the government that had preceded it . No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of unhappy reconcentrados , despite the reiterated professions made in that regard and the amount appropriated by Spain to that end . The proffered expedient of zones of cultivation proved illusory . Indeed no less practical nor more delusive promises of succor could well have been tendered to the exhausted and destitute people , stripped of all that made life and home dear and herded in a strange region among unsympathetic strangers hardly less necessitous than themselves . By the end of December the mortality among them had frightfully increased . Conservative estimates from Spanish sources placed the deaths among these distressed people at over 40 per cent from the time General Weyler s decree of reconcentration was enforced . With the acquiescence of the Spanish authorities , a scheme was adopted for relief by charitable contributions raised in this country and distributed , under the direction of the consul general and the several consuls , by noble and earnest individual effort through the organized agencies of the American Red Cross . Thousands of lives were thus saved , but many thousands more were inaccessible to such forms of aid . The war continued on the old footing , without comprehensive plan , developing only the same spasmodic encounters , barren of strategic result , that had marked the course of the earlier ten years rebellion as well as the present insurrection from its start . No alternative save physical exhaustion of either combatant , and therewithal the practical ruin of the island , lay in sight , but how far distant no one could venture to conjecture . At this juncture , on the 15th of February last , occurred the destruction of the battle ship Maine while rightfully lying in the harbor of Havana on a mission of international courtesy and good will a catastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirred the nation s heart profoundly . It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing our national character that this shocking blow , falling upon a generous people already deeply touched by preceding events in Cuba , did not move them to an instant desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition of danger and disorder at our doors that made possible such a deed , by whomsoever wrought . Yet the instinct of justice prevailed , and the nation anxiously awaited the result of the searching investigation at once set on foot . The finding of the naval board of inquiry established that the origin of the explosion was external , by a submarine mine , and only halted through lack of positive testimony to fix the responsibility of its authorship . All these things carried conviction to the most thoughtful , even before the finding of the naval court , that a crisis in our relations with Spain and toward Cuba was at hand . So strong was this belief that it needed but a brief Executive suggestion to the Congress to receive immediate answer to the duty of making instant provision for the possible and perhaps speedily probable emergency of war , and the remarkable , almost unique , spectacle was presented of a unanimous vote of both Houses , on the 9th of March , appropriating 50 , 000 , 000 for the national defense and for each and every purpose connected therewith , to be expended at the discretion of the President . That this act of prevision came none too soon was disclosed when the application of the fund was undertaken . Our coasts were practically undefended . Our Navy needed large provision for increased ammunition and supplies , and even numbers to cope with any sudden attack from the navy of Spain , which comprised modern vessels of the highest type of continental perfection . Our Army also required enlargement of men and munitions . The details of the hurried preparation for the dreaded contingency are told in the reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy , and need not be repeated here . It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war when it did come found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict . Nor was the apprehension of coming strife confined to our own country . It was felt by the continental powers , which on April 6 , through their ambassadors and envoys , addressed to the Executive an expression of hope that humanity and moderation might mark the course of this Government and people , and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement which , while securing the maintenance of peace , would afford all necessary guaranties for the reestablishment of order in Cuba . In responding to that representation I said I shared the hope the envoys had expressed that peace might be preserved in a manner to terminate the chronic condition of disturbance in Cuba , so injurious and menacing to our interests and tranquillity , as well as shocking to our sentiments of humanity and while appreciating the humanitarian and disinterested character of the communication they had made on behalf of the powers , I stated the confidence of this Government , for its part , that equal appreciation would be shown for its own earnest and unselfish endeavors to fulfill a duty to humanity by ending a situation the indefinite prolongation of which had become insufferable . Still animated by the hope of a peaceful solution and obeying the dictates of duty , no effort was relaxed to bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban struggle . Negotiations to this object continued actively with the Government of Spain , looking to the immediate conclusion of a six months armistice in Cuba , with a view to effect the recognition of her people s right to independence . Besides this , the instant revocation of the order of reconcentration was asked , so that the sufferers , returning to their homes and aided by united American and Spanish effort , might be put in a way to support themselves and , by orderly resumption of the well nigh destroyed productive energies of the island , contribute to the restoration of its tranquillity and well being . Negotiations continued for some little time at Madrid , resulting in offers by the Spanish Government which could not but be regarded as inadequate . It was proposed to confide the preparation of peace to the insular parliament , yet to be convened under the autonomous decrees of November , 1897 , but without impairment in any wise of the constitutional powers of the Madrid Government , which to that end would grant an armistice , if solicited by the insurgents , for such time as the general in chief might see fit to fix . How and with what scope of discretionary powers the insular parliament was expected to set about the preparation of peace did not appear . If it were to be by negotiation with the insurgents , the issue seemed to rest on the one side with a body chosen by a fraction of the electors in the districts under Spanish control , and on the other with the insurgent population holding the interior country , unrepresented in the so called parliament and defiant at the suggestion of suing for peace . Grieved and disappointed at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach a practicable solution , I felt it my duty to remit the whole question to the Congress . In the message of April 11 , 1898 , I announced that with this last overture in the direction of immediate peace in Cuba and its disappointing reception by Spain the effort of the Executive was brought to an end . I again reviewed the alternative courses of action which had been proposed , concluding that the only one consonant with international policy and compatible with our firm set historical traditions was intervention as a neutral to stop the war and check the hopeless sacrifice of life , even though that resort involved hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest , as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement . The grounds justifying that step were the interests of humanity , the duty to protect the life and property of our citizens in Cuba , the right to check injury to our commerce and people through the devastation of the island , and , most important , the need of removing at once and forever the constant menace and the burdens entailed upon our Government by the uncertainties and perils of the situation caused by the unendurable disturbance in Cuba . I said The long trial has proved that the object for which Spain has waged the war can not be attained . The fire of insurrection may flame or may smolder with varying seasons , but it has not been and it is plain that it can not be extinguished by present methods . The only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the enforced pacification of Cuba . In the name of humanity , in the name of civilization , in behalf of endangered American interests which give us the right and the duty to speak and to act , the war in Cuba must stop . In view of all this the Congress was asked to authorize and empower the President to take measures to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba and to secure in the island the establishment of a stable government , capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations , insuring peace and tranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own , and for the accomplishment of those ends to use the military and naval forces of the United States as might be necessary , with added authority to continue generous relief to the starving people of Cuba . The response of the Congress , after nine days of earnest deliberation , during which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed on every point save as to the expediency of coupling the proposed action with a formal recognition of the Republic of Cuba as the true and lawful government of that island a proposition which failed of adoption the Congress , after conference , on the 19th of April , by a vote of 42 to 35 in the Senate and 311 to 6 in the House of Representatives , passed the memorable joint resolution declaring First . That the people of the island of Cuba are , and of right ought to be , free and independent . Second . That it is the duty of the United States to demand , and the Government of the United States does hereby demand , that the Government of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters . Third . That the President of the United States be , and he hereby is , directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the United States and to call into the actual service of the United States the militia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary to carry these resolutions into effect . Fourth . That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty , jurisdiction , or control over said island except for the pacification thereof , and asserts its determination when that is accomplished to leave the government and control of the island to its people . This resolution was approved by the Executive on the next day , April 20 . A copy was at once communicated to the Spanish minister at this capital , who forthwith announced that his continuance in Washington had thereby become impossible , and asked for his passports , which were given him . He thereupon withdrew from Washington , leaving the protection of Spanish interests in the United States to the French ambassador and the Austro Hungarian minister . Simultaneously with its communication to the Spanish minister here , General Woodford , the American minister at Madrid , was telegraphed confirmation of the text of the joint resolution and directed to communicate it to the Government of Spain with the formal demand that it at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom , coupling this demand with announcement of the intentions of this Government as to the future of the island , in conformity with the fourth clause of the resolution , and giving Spain until noon of April 23 to reply . That demand , although , as above shown , officially made known to the Spanish envoy here , was not delivered at Madrid . After the instruction reached General Woodford on the morning of April 21 , but before he could present it , the Spanish minister of state notified him that upon the President s approval of the joint resolution the Madrid Government , regarding the act as equivalent to an evident declaration of war , had ordered its minister in Washington to withdraw , thereby breaking off diplomatic relations between the two countries and ceasing all official communication between their respective representatives . General Woodford thereupon demanded his passports and quitted Madrid the same day . Spain having thus denied the demand of the United States and initiated that complete form of rupture of relations which attends a state of war , the executive powers authorized by the resolution were at once used by me to meet the enlarged contingency of actual war between sovereign states . On April 22 I proclaimed a blockade of the north coast of Cuba , including ports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda , and the port of Cienfuegos , on the south coast of Cuba , and on the 23d I called for volunteers to execute the purpose of the resolution . By my message of April 25 the Congress was informed of the situation , and I recommended formal declaration of the existence of a state of war between the United States and Spain . The Congress accordingly voted on the same day the act approved April 25 , 1898 , declaring the existence of such war from and including the 21st day of April , and reenacted the provision of the resolution of April 20 directing the President to use all the armed forces of the nation to carry that act into effect . Due notification of the existence of war as aforesaid was given April 25 by telegraph to all the governments with which the United States maintain relations , in order that their neutrality might be assured during the war . The various governments responded with proclamations of neutrality , each after its own methods . It is not among the least gratifying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged by all , often under delicate and difficult circumstances . In further fulfillment of international duty I issued , April 26 , 1893 , a proclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels and their cargoes as to blockade , contraband , the exercise of the right of search , and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under enemy s flag . A similar proclamation was made by the Spanish Government . In the conduct of hostilities the rules of the Declaration of Paris , including abstention from resort to privateering , have accordingly been observed by both belligerents , although neither was a party to that declaration . Our country thus , after an interval of half a century of peace with all nations , found itself engaged in deadly conflict with a foreign enemy . Every nerve was strained to meet the emergency . The response to the initial call for 125 , 000 volunteers was instant and complete , as was also the result of the second call , of May 25 , for 75 , 000 additional volunteers . The ranks of the Regular Army were increased to the limits provided by the act of April 26 , 1898 . The enlisted force of the Navy on the 15th day of August , when it reached its maximum , numbered 24 , 123 men and apprentices . One hundred and three vessels were added to the Navy by purchase , 1 was presented to the Government , 1 leased , and the 4 vessels of the International Navigation Company the Paul , Louis , New York , and Paris were chartered . In addition to these the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders were turned over to the Navy Department and became temporarily a part of the auxiliary Navy . The maximum effective fighting force of the Navy during the war , separated into classes , was as follows Four battle ships of the first class , 1 battle ship of the second class , 2 armored cruisers , 6 coast defense monitors , 1 armored ram , 12 protected cruisers , 3 unprotected cruisers , 18 gunboats , 1 dynamite cruiser , 11 torpedo boats vessels of the old Navy , including monitors , 14 . Auxiliary Navy 11 auxiliary cruisers , 28 converted yachts , 27 converted tugs , 19 converted colliers , 15 revenue cutters , 4 light house tenders , and 19 miscellaneous vessels . Much alarm was felt along our entire Atlantic seaboard lest some attack might be made by the enemy . Every precaution was taken to prevent possible injury to our great cities lying along the coast . Temporary garrisons were provided , drawn from the State militia infantry and light batteries were drawn from the volunteer force . About 12 , 000 troops were thus employed . The coast signal service was established for observing the approach of an enemy s ships to the coast of the United States , and the Life Saving and Light House services cooperated , which enabled the Navy Department to have all portions of the Atlantic coast , from Maine to Texas , under observation . The auxiliary Navy was created under the authority of Congress and was officered and manned by the Naval Militia of the several States . This organization patrolled the coast and performed the duty of a second line of defense . Under the direction of the Chief of Engineers submarine mines were placed at the most exposed points . Before the outbreak of the war permanent mining casemates and cable galleries had been constructed at nearly all important harbors . Most of the torpedo material was not to be found in the market , and had to be specially manufactured . Under date of April 19 district officers were directed to take all preliminary measures short of the actual attaching of the loaded mines to the cables , and on April 22 telegraphic orders were issued to place the loaded mines in position . The aggregate number of mines placed was 1 , 535 , at the principal harbors from Maine to California . Preparations were also made for the planting of mines at certain other harbors , but owing to the early destruction of the Spanish fleet these mines were not placed . The Signal Corps was promptly organized , and performed service of the most difficult and important character . Its operations during the war covered the electrical connection of all coast fortifications , the establishment of telephonic and telegraphic facilities for the camps at Manila , Santiago , and in Puerto Rico . There were constructed 300 miles of line at ten great camps , thus facilitating military movements from those points in a manner heretofore unknown in military administration . Field telegraph lines were established and maintained under the enemy s fire at Manila , and later the Manila Hongkong cable was reopened . In Puerto Rico cable communications were opened over a discontinued route , and on land the headquarters of the commanding officer was kept in telegraphic or telephonic communication with the division commanders on four different lines of operations . There was placed in Cuban waters a completely outfitted cable ship , with war cables and cable gear , suitable both for the destruction of communications belonging to the enemy and the establishment of our own . Two ocean cables were destroyed under the enemy s batteries at Santiago . The day previous to the landing of General Shafter s corps , at Caimanera , within 20 miles of the landing place , cable communications were established and a cable station opened giving direct communication with the Government at Washington . This service was invaluable to the Executive in directing the operations of the Army and Navy . With a total force of over 1 , 300 , the loss was by disease in camp and field , officers and men included , only 5 . The national defense fund of 50 , 000 , 000 was expended in large part by the Army and Navy , and the objects for which it was used are fully shown in the reports of the several Secretaries . It was a most timely appropriation , enabling the Government to strengthen its defenses and make preparations greatly needed in case of war . This fund being inadequate to the requirements of equipment and for the conduct of the war , the patriotism of the Congress provided the means in the war revenue act of June 13 by authorizing a 3 per cent popular loan not to exceed 400 , 000 , 000 and by levying additional imposts and taxes . Of the authorized loan 200 , 000 , 000 were offered and promptly taken the subscriptions so far exceeding the call as to cover it many times over , while , preference being given to the smaller bids , no single allotment exceeded 5 , 000 . This was a most encouraging and significant result , showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the people to uphold their country s honor . It is not within the province of this message to narrate the history of the extraordinary war that followed the Spanish declaration of April 21 , but a brief recital of its more salient features is appropriate . The first encounter of the war in point of date took place April 27 , when a detachment of the blockading squadron made a reconnoissance in force at Matanzas , shelled the harbor forts , and demolished several new works in construction . The next engagement was destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime warfare . The Pacific fleet , under Commodore George Dewey , had lain for some weeks at Hongkong . Upon the colonial proclamation of neutrality being issued and the customary twenty four hours notice being given , it repaired to Mirs Bay , near Hongkong , whence it proceeded to the Philippine Islands under telegraphed orders to capture or destroy the formidable Spanish fleet then assembled at Manila . At daybreak on the 1st of May the American force entered Manila Bay , and after a few hours engagement effected the total destruction of the Spanish fleet , consisting of ten war ships and a transport , besides capturing the naval station and forts at Cavite , thus annihilating the Spanish naval power in the Pacific Ocean and completely controlling the bay of Manila , with the ability to take the city at will . Not a life was lost on our ships , the wounded only numbering seven , while not a vessel was materially injured . For this gallant achievement the Congress , upon my recommendation , fitly bestowed upon the actors preferment and substantial reward . The effect of this remarkable victory upon the spirit of our people and upon the fortunes of the war was instant . A prestige of invincibility thereby attached to our arms which continued throughout the struggle . Reenforcements were hurried to Manila under the command of Major General Merritt and firmly established within sight of the capital , which lay helpless before our guns . On the 7th day of May the Government was advised officially of the victory at Manila , and at once inquired of the commander of our fleet what troops would be required . The information was received on the 15th day of May , and the first army expedition sailed May 25 and arrived off Manila June 30 . Other expeditions soon followed , the total force consisting of 641 officers and 15 , 058 enlisted men . Only reluctance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented the early storming and capture of the city , and therewith the absolute military occupancy of the whole group . The insurgents meanwhile had resumed the active hostilities suspended by the uncompleted truce of December , 1897 . Their forces invested Manila from the northern and eastern sides , but were constrained by Admiral Dewey and General Merrill from attempting an assault . It was fitting that whatever was to be done in the way of decisive operations in that quarter should be accomplished by the strong arm of the United States alone . Obeying the stern precept of war which enjoins the overcoming of the adversary and the extinction of his power wherever assailable as the speedy and sure means to win a peace , divided victory was not permissible , for no partition of the rights and responsibilities attending the enforcement of a just and advantageous peace could be thought of . Following the comprehensive scheme of general attack , powerful forces were assembled at various points on our coast to invade Cuba and Puerto Rico . Meanwhile naval demonstrations were made at several exposed points . On May 11 the cruiser Wilmington and torpedo boat Winslow were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence the batteries at Cardenas , a gallant ensign , Worth Bagley , and four seamen falling . These grievous fatalities were , strangely enough , among the very few which occurred during our naval operations in this extraordinary conflict . Meanwhile the Spanish naval preparations had been pushed with great vigor . A powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera , which had assembled at the Cape Verde Islands before the outbreak of hostilities , had crossed the ocean , and by its erratic movements in the Caribbean Sea delayed our military plans while baffling the pursuit of our fleets . For a time fears were felt lest the Oregon and Marietta , then nearing home after their long voyage from San Francisco of over 15 , 000 miles , might be surprised by Admiral Cervera s fleet , but their fortunate arrival dispelled these apprehensions and lent much needed reenforcement . Not until Admiral Cervera took refuge in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba , about May 19 , was it practicable to plan a systematic naval and military attack upon the Antillean possessions of Spain . Several demonstrations occurred on the coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico in preparation for the larger event . On May 13 the North Atlantic Squadron shelled San Juan de Puerto Rico . On May 30 Commodore Schley s squadron bombarded the forts guarding the mouth of Santiago Harbor . Neither attack had any material result . It was evident that well ordered land operations were indispensable to achieve a decisive advantage . The next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen but the world by its exceptional heroism . On the night of June 3 Lieutenant Hobson , aided by seven devoted volunteers , blocked the narrow outlet from Santiago Harbor by sinking the collier Merrimac in the channel , under a fierce fire from the shore batteries , escaping with their lives as by a miracle , but falling into the hands of the Spaniards . It is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of heroes was cordially appreciated by the Spanish admiral , who sent a flag of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of their safety and to compliment them on their daring act . They were subsequently exchanged July 7 . By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban cable isolated the island . Thereafter the invasion was vigorously prosecuted . On June 10 , under a heavy protecting fire , a landing of 600 marines from the Oregon , Marblehead , and Yankee was effected in Guantanamo Bay , where it had been determined to establish a naval station . This important and essential port was taken from the enemy , after severe fighting , by the marines , who were the first organized force of the United States to land in Cuba . The position so won was held despite desperate attempts to dislodge our forces . By June 16 additional forces were landed and strongly in trenched . On June 22 the advance of the invading army under Major General Shafter landed at Daiquiri , about 15 miles east of Santiago . This was accomplished under great difficulties , but with marvelous dispatch . On June 23 the movement against Santiago was begun . On the 24th the first serious engagement took place , in which the First and Tenth Cavalry and the First United States Volunteer Cavalry , General Young s brigade of General Wheeler s division , participated , losing heavily . By nightfall , however , ground within 5 miles of Santiago was won . The advantage was steadily increased . On July 1 a severe battle took place , our forces gaining the outworks of Santiago on the 2d El Caney and San Juan were taken after a desperate charge , and the investment of the city was completed . The Navy cooperated by shelling the town and the coast forts . On the day following this brilliant achievement of our land forces , the 3d of July , occurred the decisive naval combat of the war . The Spanish fleet , attempting to leave the harbor , was met by the American squadron under command of Commodore Sampson . In less than three hours all the Spanish ships were destroyed , the two torpedo boats being sunk and the Maria Teresa , Almirante Oquendo , Vizcaya , and Cristobal Colon driven ashore . The Spanish admiral and over 1 , 300 men were taken prisoners . While the enemy s loss of life was deplorably large , some 600 perishing , on our side but one man was killed , on the Brooklyn , and one man seriously wounded . Although our ships were repeatedly struck , not one was seriously injured . Where all so conspicuously distinguished themselves , from the commanders to the gunners and the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms , each and all contributing toward the achievement of this astounding victory , for which neither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel in the completeness of the event and the marvelous disproportion of casualties , it would be invidious to single out any for especial honor . Deserved promotion has rewarded the more conspicuous actors . The nation s profoundest gratitude is due to all of these brave men who by their skill and devotion in a few short hours crushed the sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph whose decisiveness and far reaching consequences can scarcely be measured . Nor can we be unmindful of the achievements of our builders , mechanics , and artisans for their skill in the construction of our war ships . With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain s effort upon the ocean virtually ceased . A spasmodic effort toward the end of June to send her Mediterranean fleet , under Admiral Camara , to relieve Manila was abandoned , the expedition being recalled after it had passed through the Suez Canal . The capitulation of Santiago followed . The city was closely besieged by land , while the entrance of our ships into the harbor cut off all relief on that side . After a truce to allow of the removal of noncombatants protracted negotiations continued from July 3 until July 15 , when , under menace of immediate assault , the preliminaries of surrender were agreed upon . On the 17th General Shafter occupied the city . The capitulation embraced the entire eastern end of Cuba . The number of Spanish soldiers surrendering was 22 , 000 , all of whom were subsequently conveyed to Spain at the charge of the United States . The story of this successful campaign is told in the report of the Secretary of War , which will be laid before you . The individual valor of officers and soldiers was never more strikingly shown than in the several engagements leading to the surrender of Santiago , while the prompt movements and successive victories won instant and universal applause . To those who gained this complete triumph , which established the ascendency of the United States upon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed our supremacy on the seas , the earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due . Nor should we alone remember the gallantry of the living the dead claim our tears , and our losses by battle and disease must cloud any exultation at the result and teach us to weigh the awful cost of war , however rightful the cause or signal the victory . With the fall of Santiago the occupation of Puerto Rico became the next strategic necessity . General Miles had previously been assigned to organize an expedition for that purpose . Fortunately he was already at Santiago , where he had arrived on the 11th of July with reenforcements for General Shafter s army . With these troops , consisting of 3 , 415 infantry and artillery , two companies of engineers , and one company of the Signal Corps , General Miles left Guantanamo on July 21 , having nine transports convoyed by the fleet under Captain Higginson with the Massachusetts flagship , Dixie , Gloucester , Columbia , and Yale , the two latter carrying troops . The expedition landed at Guanica July 25 , which port was entered with little opposition . Here the fleet was joined by the Annapolis and the Wasp , while the Puritan and Amphitrite went to San Juan and joined the New Orleans , which was engaged in blockading that port . The Major General Commanding was subsequently reenforced by General Schwan s brigade of the Third Army Corps , by General Wilson with a part of his division , and also by General Brooke with a part of his corps , numbering in all 16 , 973 officers and men . On July 27 he entered Ponce , one of the most important ports in the island , from which he thereafter directed operations for the capture of the island . With the exception of encounters with the enemy at Guayama , Hormigueros , Coamo , and Yauco and an attack on a force landed at Cape San Juan , there was no serious resistance . The campaign was prosecuted with great vigor , and by the 12th of August much of the island was in our possession and the acquisition of the remainder was only a matter of a short time . At most of the points in the island our troops were enthusiastically welcomed . Protestations of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for delivery from Spanish rule met our commanders at every stage . As a potent influence toward peace the outcome of the Puerto Rican expedition was of great consequence , and generous commendation is due to those who participated in it . The last scene of the war was enacted at Manila , its starting place . On August 15 , after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces , in which the squadron assisted , the capital surrendered unconditionally . The casualties were comparatively few . By this the conquest of the Philippine Islands , virtually accomplished when the Spanish capacity for resistance was destroyed by Admiral Dewey s victory of the 1st of May , was formally sealed . To General Merrill , his officers and men , for their uncomplaining and devoted service and for their gallantry in action , the nation is sincerely grateful . Their long voyage was made with singular success , and the soldierly conduct of the men , most of whom were without previous experience in the military service , deserves unmeasured praise . The total casualties in killed and wounded in the Army during the war with Spain were Officers killed , 23 enlisted men killed , 257 total , 280 officers wounded , 113 enlisted men wounded , 1 , 464 total , 1 , 577 . Of the Navy Killed , 17 wounded , 67 died as result of wounds , 1 invalided from service , 6 total , 91 . It will be observed that while our Navy was engaged in two great battles and in numerous perilous undertakings in blockade and bombardment , and more than 50 , 000 of our troops were transported to distant lands and were engaged in assault and siege and battle and many skirmishes in unfamiliar territory , we lost in both arms of the service a total of 1 , 668 killed and wounded and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun or a flag or a transport or a ship , and , with the exception of the crew of the Merrimac , not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner . On August 7 , forty six days from the date of the landing of General Shafter s army in Cuba and twenty one days from the surrender of Santiago , the United States troops commenced embarkation for home , and our entire force was returned to the United States as early as August 24 . They were absent from the United States only two months . It is fitting that I should bear testimony to the patriotism and devotion of that large portion of our Army which , although eager to be ordered to the post of greatest exposure , fortunately was not required outside of the United States . They did their whole duty , and , like their comrades at the front , have earned the gratitude of the nation . In like manner , the officers and men of the Army and of the Navy who remained in their departments and stations faithfully performing most important duties connected with the war , and whose requests for assignment in the field and at sea I was compelled to refuse because their services were indispensable here , are entitled to the highest commendation . It is my regret that there seems to be no provision for their suitable recognition . In this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of cordial appreciation the timely and useful work of the American National Red Cross , both in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns , in sanitary assistance at several of the camps of assemblage , and later , under the able and experienced leadership of the president of the society , Miss Clara Barton , on the fields of battle and in the hospitals at the front in Cuba . Working in conjunction with the governmental authorities and under their sanction and approval , and with the enthusiastic cooperation of many patriotic women and societies in the various States , the Red Cross has fully maintained its already high reputation for intense earnestness and ability to exercise the noble purposes of its international organization , thus justifying the confidence and support which it has received at the hands of the American people . To the members and officers of this society and all who aided them in their philanthropic work the sincere and lasting gratitude of the soldiers and the public is due and is freely accorded . In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe guidance , for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers humble prayer for the continuance of His favor . The annihilation of Admiral Cervera s fleet , followed by the capitulation of Santiago , having brought to the Spanish Government a realizing sense of the hopelessness of continuing a struggle now become wholly unequal , it made overtures of peace through the French ambassador , who , with the assent of his Government , had acted as the friendly representative of Spanish interests during the war . On the 26th of July Cambon presented a communication signed by the Duke of Almodovar , the Spanish minister of state , inviting the United States to state the terms upon which it would be willing to make peace . On the 30th of July , by a communication addressed to the Duke of Almodovar and handed to Cambon , the terms of this Government were announced substantially as in the protocol afterwards signed . On the 10th of August the Spanish reply , dated August 7 , was handed by Cambon to the Secretary of State . It accepted unconditionally the terms imposed as to Cuba , Puerto Rico , and an island of the Ladrones group , but appeared to seek to introduce inadmissible reservations in regard to our demand as to the Philippine Islands . Conceiving that discussion on this point could neither be practical nor profitable , I directed that in order to avoid misunderstanding the matter should be forthwith closed by proposing the embodiment in a formal protocol of the terms upon which the negotiations for peace were to be undertaken . The vague and inexplicit suggestions of the Spanish note could not be accepted , the only reply being to present as a virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol embodying the precise terms tendered to Spain in our note of July 30 , with added stipulations of detail as to the appointment of commissioners to arrange for the evacuation of the Spanish Antilles . On August 12 Cambon announced his receipt of full powers to sign the protocol so submitted . Accordingly , on the afternoon of August 12 , Cambon , as the plenipotentiary of Spain , and the Secretary of State , as the plenipotentiary of the United States , signed a protocol providing ARTICLE Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title to Cuba . ARISpain will cede to the United States the island of Puerto Rico and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies , and also an island in the Ladrones to be selected by the United States . ARIIThe United States will occupy and hold the city , bay , and harbor of Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which shall determine the control , disposition , and government of the Philippines . The fourth article provided for the appointment of joint commissions on the part of the United States and Spain , to meet in Havana and San Juan , respectively , for the purpose of arranging and carrying out the details of the stipulated evacuation of Cuba , Puerto Rico , and other Spanish islands in the West Indies . The fifth article provided for the appointment of not more than five commissioners on each side , to meet at Paris not later than October 1 and to proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty of peace , subject to ratification according to the respective constitutional forms of the two countries . The sixth and last article provided that upon the signature of the protocol hostilities between the two countries should be suspended and that notice to that effect should be given as soon as possible by each Government to the commanders of its military and naval forces . Immediately upon the conclusion of the protocol I issued a proclamation , of August 12 , suspending hostilities on the part of the United States . The necessary orders to that end were at once given by telegraph . The blockade of the ports of Cuba and San Juan de Puerto Rico was in like manner raised . On the 18th of August the muster out of 100 , 000 volunteers , or as near that number as was found to be practicable , was ordered . On the 1st of December 101 , 165 officers and men had been mustered out and discharged from the service , and 9 , 002 more will be mustered out by the 10th of this month also a corresponding number of general and general staff officers have been honorably discharged the service . The military commissions to superintend the evacuation of Cuba , Puerto Rico , and the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed for Cuba , Major General James Wade , Rear Admiral William Sampson , Major General Matthew Butler for Puerto Rico , Major General John Brooke , Rear Admiral Winfield Schley , Brigadier General William Gordon who soon afterwards met the Spanish commissioners at Havana and San Juan , respectively . The Puerto Rican Joint Commission speedily accomplished its task , and by the 18th of October the evacuation of the island was completed . The United States flag was raised over the island at noon on that day . The administration of its affairs has been provisionally intrusted to a military governor until the Congress shall otherwise provide . The Cuban Joint Commission has not yet terminated its labors . Owing to the difficulties in the way of removing the large numbers of Spanish troops still in Cuba , the evacuation can not be completed before the 1st of January next . Pursuant to the fifth article of the protocol , I appointed William Day , lately Secretary of State Cushman Davis , William Frye , and George Gray , Senators of the United States , and Whitelaw Reid to be the peace commissioners on the part of the United States . Proceeding in due season to Paris , they there met on the 1st of October five commissioners similarly appointed on the part of Spain . Their negotiations have made hopeful progress , so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definitive treaty of peace before the Senate , with a review of the steps leading to its signature . I do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the new possessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain . Such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified . In the meantime and until the Congress has legislated otherwise it will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation and give to the people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and beneficent rule . As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for themselves . This should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success . It is important that our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commercial relations close and reciprocal . It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island , encourage the industry of the people , and assist them to form a government which shall be free and independent , thus realizing the best aspirations of the Cuban people . Spanish rule must be replaced by a just , benevolent , and humane government , created by the people of Cuba , capable of performing all international obligations , and which shall encourage thrift , industry , and prosperity and promote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants , whatever may have been their relations in the past . Neither revenge nor passion should have a place in the new government . Until there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be continued . With the one exception of the rupture with Spain , the intercourse of the United States with the great family of nations has been marked with cordiality , and the close of the eventful year finds most of the issues that necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign states adjusted or presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solution by amicable agreement . A long unsettled dispute as to the extended boundary between the Argentine Republic and Chile , stretching along the Andean crests from the southern border of the Atacama Desert to Magellan Straits , nearly a third of the length of the South American continent , assumed an acute stage in the early part of the year , and afforded to this Government occasion to express the hope that the resort to arbitration , already contemplated by existing conventions between the parties , might prevail despite the grave difficulties arising in its application . I am happy to say that arrangements to this end have been perfected , the questions of fact upon which the respective commissioners were unable to agree being in course of reference to Her Britannic Majesty for determination . A residual difference touching the northern boundary line across the Atacama Desert , for which existing treaties provided no adequate adjustment , bids fair to be settled in like manner by a joint commission , upon which the United States minister at Buenos Ayres has been invited to serve as umpire in the last resort . I have found occasion to approach the Argentine Government with a view to removing differences of rate charges imposed upon the cables of an American corporation in the transmission between Buenos Ayres and the cities of Uruguay and Brazil of through messages passing from and to the United States . Although the matter is complicated by exclusive concessions by Uruguay and Brazil to foreign companies , there is strong hope that a good understanding will be reached and that the important channels of commercial communication between the United States and the Atlantic cities of South America may be freed from an almost prohibitory discrimination . In this relation I may be permitted to express my sense of the fitness of an international agreement whereby the interchange of messages over connecting cables may be regulated on a fair basis of uniformity . The world has seen the postal system developed from a congeries of independent and exclusive services into a well ordered union , of which all countries enjoy the manifold benefits . It would be strange were the nations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization , which owes so much of its progress to the annihilation of space by the electric force , demands that this all important means of communication be a heritage of all peoples , to be administered and regulated in their common behoof . A step in this direction was taken when the international convention of 1884 for the protection of submarine cables was signed , and the day is , I trust , not far distant when this medium for the transmission of thought from land to land may be brought within the domain of international concert as completely as is the material carriage of commerce and correspondence upon the face of the waters that divide them . The claim of Thomas Jefferson Page against Argentina , which has been pending many years , has been adjusted . The sum awarded by the Congress of Argentina was 4 , 242 . 35 . The sympathy of the American people has justly been offered to the ruler and the people of Austria Hungary by reason of the affliction that has lately befallen them in the assassination of the Empress Queen of that historic realm . On the 10th of September , 1897 , a conflict took place at Lattimer , Pa . , between a body of striking miners and the sheriff of Luzerne County and his deputies , in which 22 miners were killed and 44 wounded , of whom 10 of the killed and 12 of the wounded were Austrian and Hungarian subjects . This deplorable event naturally aroused the solicitude of the Austro Hungarian Government , which , on the assumption that the killing and wounding involved the unjustifiable misuse of authority , claimed reparation for the sufferers . Apart from the searching investigation and peremptory action of the authorities of Pennsylvania , the Federal Executive took appropriate steps to learn the merits of the case , in order to be in a position to meet the urgent complaint of a friendly power . The sheriff and his deputies , having been indicted for murder , were tried , and acquitted , after protracted proceedings and the hearing of hundreds of witnesses , on the ground that the killing was in the line of their official duty to uphold law and preserve public order in the State . A representative of the Department of Justice attended the trial and reported its course fully . With all the facts in its possession , this Government expects to reach a harmonious understanding on the subject with that of Austria Hungary , notwithstanding the renewed claim of the latter , after learning the result of the trial , for indemnity for its injured subjects . Despite the brief time allotted for preparation , the exhibits of this country at the Universal Exposition at Brussels in 1897 enjoyed the singular distinction of a larger proportion of awards , having regard to the number and classes of articles entered than those of other countries . The worth of such a result in making known our national capacity to supply the world s markets is obvious . Exhibitions of this international character are becoming more frequent as the exchanges of commercial countries grow more intimate and varied . Hardly a year passes that this Government is not invited to national participation at some important foreign center , but often on too short notice to permit of recourse to Congress for the power and means to do so . My predecessors have suggested the advisability of providing by a general enactment and a standing appropriation for accepting such invitations and for representation of this country by a commission . This plan has my cordial approval . I trust that the Belgian restrictions on the importation of cattle from the United States , originally adopted as a sanitary precaution , will at an early day be relaxed as to their present features of hardship and discrimination , so as to admit live cattle under due regulation of their slaughter after landing . I am hopeful , too , of favorable change in the Belgian treatment of our preserved and salted meats . The growth of direct trade between the two countries , not alone for Belgian consumption and Belgian products , but by way of transit from and to other continental states , has been both encouraging and beneficial . No effort will be spared to enlarge its advantages by seeking the removal of needless impediments and by arrangements for increased commercial exchanges . The year s events in Central America deserve more than passing mention . A menacing rupture between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was happily composed by the signature of a convention between the parties , with the concurrence of the Guatemalan representative as a mediator , the act being negotiated and signed on board the United States steamer Alert , then lying in Central American waters . It is believed that the good offices of our envoy and of the commander of that vessel contributed toward this gratifying outcome . In my last annual message the situation was presented with respect to the diplomatic representation of this Government in Central America created by the association of Nicaragua , Honduras , and Salvador under the title of the Greater Republic of Central America , and the delegation of their international functions to the Diet thereof . While the representative character of the Diet was recognized by my predecessor and has been confirmed during my Administration by receiving its accredited envoy and granting exequaturs to consuls commissioned under its authority , that recognition was qualified by the distinct understanding that the responsibility of each of the component sovereign Republics toward the United States remained wholly unaffected . This proviso was needful inasmuch as the compact of the three Republics was at the outset an association whereby certain representative functions were delegated to a tripartite commission rather than a federation possessing centralized powers of government and administration . In this view of their relation and of the relation of the United States to the several Republics , a change in the representation of this country in Central America was neither recommended by the Executive nor initiated by Congress , thus leaving one of our envoys accredited , as heretofore , separately to two States of the Greater Republic , Nicaragua and Salvador , and to a third State , Costa Rica , which was not a party to the compact , while our other envoy was similarly accredited to a union State , Honduras , and a nonunion State , Guatemala . The result has been that the one has presented credentials only to the President of Costa Rica , the other having been received only by the Government of Guatemala . Subsequently the three associated Republics entered into negotiations for taking the steps forecast in the original compact . A convention of their delegates framed for them a federal constitution under the name of the United States of Central America , and provided for a central federal government and legislature . Upon ratification by the constituent States , the 1st of November last was fixed for the new system to go into operation . Within a few weeks thereafter the plan was severely tested by revolutionary movements arising , with a consequent demand for unity of action on the part of the military power of the federal States to suppress them . Under this strain the new union seems to have been weakened through the withdrawal of its more important members . This Government was not officially advised of the installation of the federation and has maintained an attitude of friendly expectancy , while in no wise relinquishing the position held from the outset that the responsibilities of the several States toward us remained unaltered by their tentative relations among themselves . The Nicaragua Canal Commission , under the chairmanship of Rear Admiral John Walker , appointed July 24 , 1897 , under the authority of a provision in the sundry civil act of June 4 of that year , has nearly completed its labors , and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the proper route , the feasibility , and the cost of construction of an interoceanic canal by a Nicaraguan route will be laid before you . In the performance of its task the commission received all possible courtesy and assistance from the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica , which thus testified their appreciation of the importance of giving a speedy and practical outcome to the great project that has for so many years engrossed the attention of the respective countries . As the scope of the recent inquiry embraced the whole subject , with the aim of making plans and surveys for a canal by the most convenient route , it necessarily included a review of the results of previous surveys and plans , and in particular those adopted by the Maritime Canal Company under its existing concessions from Nicaragua and Costa Rica , so that to this extent those grants necessarily hold as essential a part in the deliberations and conclusions of the Canal Commission as they have held and must needs hold in the discussion of the matter by the Congress . Under these circumstances and in view of overtures made to the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other parties for a new canal concession predicated on the assumed approaching lapse of the contracts of the Maritime Canal Company with those States , I have not hesitated to express my conviction that considerations of expediency and international policy as between the several governments interested in the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of the status quo until the Canal Commission shall have reported and the United States Congress shall have had the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the present session , without prejudice by reason of any change in the existing conditions . Nevertheless , it appears that the Government of Nicaragua , as one of its last sovereign acts before merging its powers in those of the newly formed United States of Central America , has granted an optional concession to another association , to become effective on the expiration of the present grant . It does not appear what surveys have been made or what route is proposed under this contingent grant , so that an examination of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced in the report of the Canal Commission . All these circumstances suggest the urgency of some definite action by the Congress at this session if the labors of the past are to be utilized and the linking of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a practical waterway is to be realized . That the construction of such a maritime highway is now more than ever indispensable to that intimate and ready intercommunication between our eastern and western seaboards demanded by the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and the prospective expansion of our influence and commerce in the Pacific , and that our national policy now more imperatively than ever calls for its control by this Government , are propositions which I doubt not the Congress will duly appreciate and wisely act upon . A convention providing for the revival of the late United States and Chilean Claims Commission and the consideration of claims which were duly presented to the late commission , but not considered because of the expiration of the time limited for the duration of the commission , was signed May 24 , 1897 , and has remained unacted upon by the Senate . The term therein fixed for effecting the exchange of ratifications having elapsed , the convention falls unless the time be extended by amendment , which I am endeavoring to bring about , with the friendly concurrence of the Chilean Government . The United States has not been an indifferent spectator of the extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese Empire , whereby portions of its maritime provinces are passing under the control of various European powers but the prospect that the vast commerce which the energy of our citizens and the necessity of our staple productions for Chinese uses has built up in those regions may not be prejudiced through any exclusive treatment by the new occupants has obviated the need of our country becoming an actor in the scene . Our position among nations , having a large Pacific coast and a constantly expanding direct trade with the farther Orient , gives us the equitable claim to consideration and friendly treatment in this regard , and it will be my aim to subserve our large interests in that quarter by all means appropriate to the constant policy of our Government . The territories of Kiao chow , of Wei hai wei , and of Port Arthur and Talienwan , leased to Germany , Great Britain , and Russia , respectively , for terms of years , will , it is announced , be open to international commerce during such alien occupation and if no discriminating treatment of American citizens and their trade be found to exist or be hereafter developed , the desire of this Government would appear to be realized . In this relation , as showing the volume and value of our exchanges with China and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist for their expansion in the normal course of trade , I refer to the communication addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives by the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of last June , with its accompanying letter of the Secretary of State , recommending an appropriation for a commission to study the commercial and industrial conditions in the Chinese Empire and report as to the opportunities for and obstacles to the enlargement of markets in China for the raw products and manufactures of the United States . Action was not taken thereon during the late session . I cordially urge that the recommendation receive at your hands the consideration which its importance and timeliness merit . Meanwhile there may be just ground for disquietude in view of the unrest and revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alien people which pervades certain of the Chinese provinces . As in the case of the attacks upon our citizens in Szechuen and at Kutien in 1895 , the United States minister has been instructed to secure the fullest measure of protection , both local and imperial , for any menaced American interests , and to demand , in case of lawless injury to person or property , instant reparation appropriate to the case . War ships have been stationed at Tientsin for more ready observation of the disorders which have invaded even the Chinese capital , so as to be in a position to act should need arise , while a guard of marines has been sent to Peking to afford the minister the same measure of authoritative protection as the representatives of other nations have been constrained to employ . Following close upon the rendition of the award of my predecessor as arbitrator of the claim of the Italian subject Cerruti against the Republic of Colombia , differences arose between the parties to the arbitration in regard to the scope and extension of the award , of which certain articles were contested by Colombia , while Italy claimed their literal fulfillment . The award having been made by the President of the United States , as an act of friendly consideration and with the sole view to an impartial composition of the matter in dispute , I could not but feel deep concern at such a miscarriage , and while unable to accept the Colombian theory that in my official capacity , possessed continuing functions as arbitrator , with power to interpret or revise the terms of the award , my best efforts were lent to bring the parties to a harmonious agreement as to the execution of its provisions . A naval demonstration by Italy resulted in an engagement to pay the liabilities claimed upon their ascertainment but this apparent disposition of the controversy was followed by a rupture of diplomatic intercourse between Colombia and Italy , which still continues , although , fortunately , without acute symptoms having supervened . Notwithstanding this , efforts are reported to be continuing for the ascertainment of Colombia s contingent liability on account of Cerruti s debts under the fifth article of the award . A claim of an American citizen against the Dominican Republic for a public bridge over the Ozama River , which has been in diplomatic controversy for several years , has been settled by expert arbitration and an award in favor of the claimant amounting to about 90 , 000 . It , however , remains unpaid , despite urgent demands for its settlement according to the terms of the compact . There is now every prospect that the participation of the United States in the Universal Exposition to be held in Paris in 1900 will be on a scale commensurate with the advanced position held by our products and industries in the world s chief marts . The preliminary report of Moses Handy , who , under the act approved July 19 , 1897 , was appointed special commissioner with a view to securing all attainable information necessary to a full and complete understanding by Congress in regard to the participation of this Government in the Paris Exposition , was laid before you by my message of December 6 , 1897 , and showed the large opportunities opened to make known our national progress in arts , science , and manufactures , as well as the urgent need of immediate and adequate provision to enable due advantage thereof to be taken . Handy s death soon afterwards rendered it necessary for another to take up and complete his unfinished work , and on January 11 last Thomas Cridler , Third Assistant Secretary of State , was designated to fulfill that task . His report was laid before you by my message of June 14 , 1898 , with the gratifying result of awakening renewed interest in the projected display . By a provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1 , 1898 , a sum not to exceed 650 , 000 was allotted for the organization of a commission to care for the proper preparation and installation of American exhibits and for the display of suitable exhibits by the several Executive Departments , particularly by the Department of Agriculture , the Fish Commission , and the Smithsonian Institution , in representation of the Government of the United States . Pursuant to that enactment I appointed Ferdinand Peck , of Chicago , commissioner general , with an assistant commissioner general and a secretary . Peck at once proceeded to Paris , where his success in enlarging the scope and variety of the United States exhibit has been most gratifying . Notwithstanding the comparatively limited area of the exposition site less than one half that of the World s Fair at Chicago the space assigned to the United States has been increased from the absolute allotment of 157 , 403 square feet reported by Handy to some 202 , 000 square feet , with corresponding augmentation of the field for a truly characteristic representation of the various important branches of our country s development . Peck s report will be laid before you . In my judgment its recommendations will call for your early consideration , especially as regards an increase of the appropriation to at least one million dollars in all , so that not only may the assigned space be fully taken up by the best possible exhibits in every class , but the preparation and installation be on so perfect a scale as to rank among the first in that unparalleled competition of artistic and inventive production , and thus counterbalance the disadvantage with which we start as compared with other countries whose appropriations are on a more generous scale and whose preparations are in a state of much greater forwardness than our Where our artisans have the admitted capacity to excel , where our inventive genius has initiated many of the grandest discoveries of these later days of the century , and where the native resources of our land are as limitless as they are valuable to supply the world s needs , it is our province , as it should be our earnest care , to lead in the march of human progress , and not rest content with any secondary place . Moreover , if this be due to ourselves , it is no less due to the great French nation whose guests we become , and which has in so many ways testified its wish and hope that our participation shall befit the place the two peoples have won in the field of universal development . The commercial arrangement made with France on the 28th of May , 1898 , under the provisions of section 3 of the tariff act of 1897 , went into effect on the 1st day of June following . It has relieved a portion of our export trade from serious embarrassment . Further negotiations are now pending under section 4 of the same act with a view to the increase of trade between the two countries to their mutual advantage . Negotiations with other governments , in part interrupted by the war with Spain , are in progress under both sections of the tariff act . I hope to be able to announce some of the results of these negotiations during the present session of Congress . Negotiations to the same end with Germany have been set on foot . Meanwhile no effort has been relaxed to convince the Imperial Government of the thoroughness of our inspection of pork products for exportation , and it is trusted that the efficient administration of this measure by the Department of Agriculture will be recognized as a guaranty of the healthfulness of the food staples we send abroad to countries where their use is large and necessary . I transmitted to the Senate on the 10th of February last information touching the prohibition against the importation of fresh fruits from this country , which had then recently been decreed by Germany on the ground of danger of disseminating the San Jose scale insect . This precautionary measure was justified by Germany on the score of the drastic steps taken in several States of the Union against the spread of the pest , the elaborate reports of the Department of Agriculture being put in evidence to show the danger to German fruit growing interests should the scale obtain a lodgment in that country . Temporary relief was afforded in the case of large consignments of fruit then on the way by inspection and admission when found noninfected . Later the prohibition was extended to dried fruits of every kind , but was relaxed so as to apply only to unpeeled fruit and fruit waste . As was to be expected , the alarm reached to other countries , and Switzerland has adopted a similar inhibition . Efforts are in progress to induce the German and Swiss Governments to relax the prohibition in favor of dried fruits shown to have been cured under circumstances rendering the existence of animal life impossible . Our relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendly footing . Assenting to our request , the protection of Americans and their interests in Spanish jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic and consular representatives of Great Britain , who fulfilled their delicate and arduous trust with tact and zeal , eliciting high commendation . I may be allowed to make fitting allusion to the instance of Ramsden , Her Majesty s consul at Santiago de Cuba , whose untimely death after distinguished service and untiring effort during the siege of that city was sincerely lamented . In the early part of April last , pursuant to a request made at the instance of the Secretary of State by the British ambassador at this capital , the Canadian government granted facilities for the passage of four United States revenue cutters from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic coast by way of the Canadian canals and the Lawrence River . The vessels had reached Lake Ontario and were there awaiting the opening of navigation when war was declared between the United States and Spain . Her Majesty s Government thereupon , by a communication of the latter part of April , stated that the permission granted before the outbreak of hostilities would not be withdrawn provided the United States Government gave assurance that the vessels in question would proceed direct to a United States port without engaging in any hostile operation . This Government promptly agreed to the stipulated condition , it being understood that the vessels would not be prohibited from resisting any hostile attack . It will give me especial satisfaction if I shall be authorized to communicate to you a favorable conclusion of the pending negotiations with Great Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada . It is the earnest wish of this Government to remove all sources of discord and irritation in our relations with the neighboring Dominion . The trade between the two countries is constantly increasing , and it is important to both countries that all reasonable facilities should be granted for its development . The Government of Greece strongly urges the onerousness of the duty here imposed upon the currants of that country , amounting to 100 per cent or more of their market value . This fruit is stated to be exclusively a Greek product , not coming into competition with any domestic product . The question of reciprocal commercial relations with Greece , including the restoration of currants to the free list , is under consideration . The long standing claim of Bernard Campbell for damages for injuries sustained from a violent assault committed against him by military authorities in the island of Haiti has been settled by the agreement of that Republic to pay him 10 , 000 in American gold . Of this sum 5 , 000 has already been paid . It is hoped that other pending claims of American citizens against that Republic may be amicably adjusted . Pending the consideration by the Senate of the treaty signed June 1897 , by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the Republic of Hawaii , providing for the annexation of the islands , a joint resolution to accomplish the same purpose by accepting the offered cession and incorporating the ceded territory into the Union was adopted by the Congress and approved July 7 , 1898 . I thereupon directed the United States steamship Philadelphia to convey Rear Admiral Miller to Honolulu , and intrusted to his hands this important legislative act , to be delivered to the President of the Republic of Hawaii , with whom the Admiral and the United States minister were authorized to make appropriate arrangements for transferring the sovereignty of the islands to the United States . This was simply but impressively accomplished on the 12th of August last by the delivery of a certified copy of the resolution to President Dole , who thereupon yielded up to the representative of the Government of the United States the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands . Pursuant to the terms of the joint resolution and in exercise of the authority thereby conferred upon me , I directed that the civil , judicial , and military powers theretofore exercised by the officers of the Government of the Republic of Hawaii should continue to be exercised by those officers until Congress shall provide a government for the incorporated territory , subject to my power to remove such officers and to fill vacancies . The President , officers , and troops of the Republic thereupon took the oath of allegiance to the United States , thus providing for the uninterrupted continuance of all the administrative and municipal functions of the annexed territory until Congress shall otherwise enact . Following the further provision of the joint resolution , I appointed the Hons . Shelby Cullom , of Illinois , John Morgan , of Alabama , Robert Hitt , of Illinois , Sanford Dole , of Hawaii , and Walter Frear , of Hawaii , as commissioners to confer and recommend to Congress such legislation concerning the Hawaiian Islands as they should deem necessary or proper . The commissioners having fulfilled the mission confided to them , their report will be laid before you at an early day . It is believed that their recommendations will have the earnest consideration due to the magnitude of the responsibility resting upon you to give such shape to the relationship of those mid Pacific lands to our home Union as will benefit both in the highest degree , realizing the aspirations of the community that has cast its lot with us and elected to share our political heritage , while at the same time justifying the foresight of those who for three quarters of a century have looked to the assimilation of Hawaii as a natural and inevitable consummation , in harmony with our needs and in fulfillment of our cherished traditions . The questions heretofore pending between Hawaii and Japan growing out of the alleged mistreatment of Japanese treaty immigrants were , I am pleased to say , adjusted before the act of transfer by the payment of a reasonable indemnity to the Government of Japan . Under the provisions of the joint resolution , the existing customs relations of the Hawaiian Islands with the United States and with other countries remain unchanged until legislation shall otherwise provide . The consuls of Hawaii here and in foreign countries continue to fulfill their commercial agencies , while the United States consulate at Honolulu is maintained for all appropriate services pertaining to trade and the revenue . It would be desirable that all foreign consuls in the Hawaiian Islands should receive new exequaturs from this Government . The attention of Congress is called to the fact that , our consular offices having ceased to exist in Hawaii and being about to cease in other countries coming under the sovereignty of the United States , the provisions for the relief and transportation of destitute American seamen in these countries under our consular regulations will in consequence terminate . It is proper , therefore , that new legislation should be enacted upon this subject in order to meet the changed conditions . The interpretation of certain provisions of the extradition convention of December 11 , 1861 , has been at various times the occasion of controversy with the Government of Mexico . An acute difference arose in the case of the Mexican demand for the delivery of Jesus Guerra , who , having led a marauding expedition near the border with the proclaimed purpose of initiating an insurrection against President Diaz , escaped into Texas . Extradition was refused on the ground that the alleged offense was political in its character , and therefore came within the treaty proviso of nonsurrender . The Mexican contention was that the exception only related to purely political offenses , and that as Guerra s acts were admixed with the common crime of murder , arson , kidnaping , and robbery , the option of nondelivery became void , a position which this Government was unable to admit in view of the received international doctrine and practice in the matter . The Mexican Government , in view of this , gave notice January 24 , 1898 , of the termination of the convention , to take effect twelve months from that date , at the same time inviting the conclusion of a new convention , toward which negotiations are on foot . In this relation I may refer to the necessity of some amendment of our existing extradition statute . It is a common stipulation of such treaties that neither party shall be bound to give up its own citizens , with the added proviso in one of our treaties , that with Japan , that it may surrender if it see fit . It is held in this country by an almost uniform course of decisions that where a treaty negatives the obligation to surrender the President is not invested with legal authority to act . The conferment of such authority would be in the line of that sound morality which shrinks from affording secure asylum to the author of a heinous crime . Again , statutory provision might well be made for what is styled extradition by way of transit , whereby a fugitive surrendered by one foreign government to another may be conveyed across the territory of the United States to the jurisdiction of the demanding state . A recommendation in this behalf made in the President s message of 1886 was not acted upon . The matter is presented for your consideration . The problem of the Mexican free zone has been often discussed with regard to its inconvenience as a provocative of smuggling into the United States along an extensive and thinly guarded land border . The effort made by the joint resolution of March 1 , 1895 , to remedy the abuse charged by suspending the privilege of free transportation in bond across the territory of the United States to Mexico failed of good result , as is stated in Report No . 702 of the House of Representatives , submitted in the last session , March 11 , 1898 . As the question is one to be conveniently met by wise concurrent legislation of the two countries looking to the protection of the revenues by harmonious measures operating equally on either side of the boundary , rather than by conventional arrangements , I suggest that Congress consider the advisability of authorizing and inviting a conference of representatives of the Treasury Departments of the United States and Mexico to consider the subject in all its complex bearings , and make report with pertinent recommendations to the respective Governments for the information and consideration of their Congresses . The Mexican Water Boundary Commission has adjusted all matters submitted to it to the satisfaction of both Governments save in three important cases that of the Chamizal at El Paso , Tex . , where the two commissioners failed to agree , and wherein , for this case only , this Government has proposed to Mexico the addition of a third member the proposed elimination of what are known as Bancos , small isolated islands formed by the cutting off of bends in the Rio Grande , from the operation of the treaties of 1884 and 1889 , recommended by the commissioners and approved by this Government , but still under consideration by Mexico and the subject of the Equitable distribution of the waters of the Rio Grande , for which the commissioners recommended an international dam and reservoir , approved by Mexico , but still under consideration by this Government . Pending these questions it is necessary to extend the life of the commission , which expires December 23 next . The coronation of the young Queen of the Netherlands was made the occasion of fitting congratulations . The claim of Victor McCord against Peru , which for a number of years has been pressed by this Government and has on several occasions attracted the attention of the Congress , has been satisfactorily adjusted . A protocol was signed May 17 , 1898 , whereby , the fact of liability being admitted , the question of the amount to be awarded was submitted to the chief justice of Canada as sole arbitrator . His award sets the indemnity due the claimant at 40 , 000 . The Government of Peru has given the prescribed notification of its intention to abrogate the treaty of friendship , commerce , and navigation concluded with this country August 31 , 1887 . As that treaty contains many important provisions necessary to the maintenance of commerce and good relations , which could with difficulty be replaced by the negotiation of renewed provisions within the brief twelve months intervening before the treaty terminates , I have invited suggestions by Peru as to the particular provisions it is desired to annul , in the hope of reaching an arrangement whereby the remaining articles may be provisionally saved . His Majesty the Czar having announced his purpose to raise the Imperial Russian mission at this capital to the rank of an embassy , I responded , under the authority conferred by the act of March 3 , 1893 , by commissioning and accrediting the actual representative at Petersburg in the capacity of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary . The Russian ambassador to this country has since presented his credentials . The proposal of the Czar for a general reduction of the vast military establishments that weigh so heavily upon many peoples in time of peace was communicated to this Government with an earnest invitation to be represented in the conference which it is contemplated to assemble with a view to discussing the means of accomplishing so desirable a result . His Majesty was at once informed of the cordial sympathy of this Government with the principle involved in his exalted proposal and of the readiness of the United States to take part in the conference . The active military force of the United States , as measured by our population , territorial area , and taxable wealth , is , and under any conceivable prospective conditions must continue to be , in time of peace so conspicuously less than that of the armed powers to whom the Czar s appeal is especially addressed that the question can have for us no practical importance save as marking an auspicious step toward the betterment of the condition of the modern peoples and the cultivation of peace and good will among them but in this view it behooves us as a nation to lend countenance and aid to the beneficent project . The claims of owners of American sealing vessels for seizure by Russian cruisers in Bering Sea are being pressed to a settlement . The equities of the cases justify the expectation that a measure of reparation will eventually be accorded in harmony with precedent and in the light of the proven facts . The recommendation made in my special message of April 27 last is renewed , that appropriation be made to reimburse the master and owners of the Russian bark Hans for wrongful arrest of the master and detention of the vessel in February , 1896 , by officers of the United States district court for the southern district of Mississippi . The papers accompanying my said message make out a most meritorious claim and justify the urgency with which it has been presented by the Government of Russia . Malietoa Laupepa , King of Samoa , died on August 22 last . According to Article I of the general act of Berlin , his successor shall be duly elected according to the laws and customs of Samoa . Arrangements having been agreed upon between the signatories of the general act for the return of Mataafa and the other exiled Samoan chiefs , they were brought from Jaluit by a German war vessel and landed at Apia on September 18 last . Whether the death of Malietoa and the return of his old time rival Mataafa will add to the undesirable complications which the execution of the tripartite general act has heretofore developed remains to be seen . The efforts of this Government will , as heretofore , be addressed toward a harmonious and exact fulfillment of the terms of the international engagement to which the United States became a party in 1889 . The Cheek claim against Siam , after some five years of controversy , has been adjusted by arbitration under an agreement signed July 6 , 1897 , an award of 706 , 721 ticals about 187 , 987 . 78 , with release of the Cheek estate from mortgage claims , having been rendered March 21 , 1898 , in favor of the claimant by the arbitrator , Sir Nicholas John Hannen , British chief justice for China and Japan . An envoy from Siam has been accredited to this Government and has presented his credentials . Immediately upon the outbreak of the war with Spain the Swiss Government , fulfilling the high mission it has deservedly assumed as the patron of the International Red Cross , proposed to the United States and Spain that they should severally recognize and carry into execution , as a modus vivendi , during the continuance of hostilities , the additional articles proposed by the international conference of Geneva , October 20 , 1868 , extending the effects of the existing Red Cross convention of 1864 to the conduct of naval war . Following the example set by France and Germany in 1870 in adopting such a modus vivendi , and in view of the accession of the United States to those additional articles in 1882 , although the exchange of ratifications thereof still remained uneffected , the Swiss proposal was promptly and cordially accepted by us , and simultaneously by Spain . This Government feels a keen satisfaction in having thus been enabled to testify its adherence to the broadest principles of humanity even amidst the clash of war , and it is to be hoped that the extension of the Red Cross compact to hostilities by sea as well as on land may soon become an accomplished fact through the general promulgation of the additional naval Red Cross articles by the maritime powers now parties to the convention of 1864 . The important question of the claim of Switzerland to the perpetual cantonal allegiance of American citizens of Swiss origin has not made hopeful progress toward a solution , and controversies in this regard still continue . The newly accredited envoy of the United States to the Ottoman Porte carries instructions looking to the disposal of matters in controversy with Turkey for a number of years . He is especially charged to press for a just settlement of our claims for indemnity by reason of the destruction of the property of American missionaries resident in that country during the Armenian troubles of 1895 , as well as for the recognition of older claims of equal justness . He is also instructed to seek an adjustment of the dispute growing out of the refusal of Turkey to recognize the acquired citizenship of Ottoman born persons naturalized in the United States since 1869 without prior imperial consent , and in the same general relation he is directed to endeavor to bring about a solution of the question which has more or less acutely existed since 1869 concerning the jurisdictional rights of the United States in matters of criminal procedure and punishment under Article IV of the treaty of 1830 . This latter difficulty grows out of a verbal difference , claimed by Turkey to be essential , between the original Turkish text and the promulgated translation . After more than two years from the appointment of a consul of this country to Erzerum , he has received his exequatur . The arbitral tribunal appointed under the treaty of February 2 , 1897 , between Great Britain and Venezuela , to determine the boundary line between the latter and the colony of British Guiana , is to convene at Paris during the present month . It is a source of much gratification to this Government to see the friendly resort of arbitration applied to the settlement of this controversy , not alone because of the earnest part we have had in bringing about the result , but also because the two members named on behalf of Venezuela , Chief Justice Fuller and Justice Brewer , chosen from our highest court , appropriately testify the continuing interest we feel in the definitive adjustment of the question according to the strictest rules of justice . The British members , Lord Herschell and Sir Richard Collins , are jurists of no less exalted repute , while the fifth member and president of the tribunal , De Martens , has earned a world wide reputation as an authority upon international law . The claim of Felipe Scandella against Venezuela for arbitrary expulsion and injury to his business has been adjusted by the revocation of the order of expulsion and by the payment of the sum of 16 , 000 . I have the satisfaction of being able to state that the Bureau of the American Republics , created in 1890 as the organ for promoting commercial intercourse and fraternal relations among the countries of the Western Hemisphere , has become a more efficient instrument of the wise purposes of its founders , and is receiving the cordial support of the contributing members of the international union which are actually represented in its board of management . A commercial directory , in two volumes , containing a mass of statistical matter descriptive of the industrial and commercial interests of the various countries , has been printed in English , Spanish , Portuguese , and French , and a monthly bulletin published in these four languages and distributed in the Latin American countries as well as in the United States has proved to be a valuable medium for disseminating information and furthering the varied interests of the international union . During the past year the important work of collecting information of practical benefit to American industries and trade through the agency of the diplomatic and consular officers has been steadily advanced , and in order to lay such data before the public with the least delay the practice was begun in January , 1898 , of issuing the commercial reports from day to day as they are received by the Department of State . It is believed that for promptitude as well as fullness of information the service thus supplied to our merchants and manufacturers will be found to show sensible improvement and to merit the liberal support of Congress . The experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense of the burdens and the waste of war . We desire , in common with most civilized nations , to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage sustained in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce . It is true we may suffer in such cases less than other communities , but all nations are damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehension into which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire commercial world . It should be our object , therefore , to minimize , so far as practicable , this inevitable loss and disturbance . This purpose can probably best be accomplished by an international agreement to regard all private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by the forces of belligerent powers . The United States Government has for many years advocated this humane and beneficent principle , and is now in position to recommend it to other powers without the imputation of selfish motives . I therefore suggest for your consideration that the Executive be authorized to correspond with the governments of the principal maritime powers with a view of incorporating into the permanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemption of all private property at sea , not contraband of war , from capture or destruction by belligerent powers . The Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the Government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1898 , including 64 , 751 , 223 received from sale of Pacific railroads , amounted to 405 , 321 , 335 , and its expenditures to 443 , 168 , 582 . There was collected from customs 149 , 575 , 062 and from internal revenue 170 , 900 , 641 . Our dutiable imports amounted to 324 , 635 , 479 , a decrease of 58 , 156 , 690 over the preceding year , and importations free of duty amounted to 291 , 414 , 175 , a decrease from the preceding year of 90 , 524 , 068 . Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by 24 , 212 , 067 . The total tax collected on distilled spirits was 92 , 546 , 999 on manufactured tobacco , 36 , 230 , 522 , and on fermented liquors , 39 , 515 , 421 . We exported merchandise during the year amounting to 1 , 231 , 482 , 330 , an increase of 180 , 488 , 774 from the preceding year . It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the Government for the year ending June 30 , 1899 , will be 577 , 874 , 647 , and its expenditures 689 , 874 , 647 , resulting in a deficiency of 112 , 000 , 000 . On the 1st of December , 1898 , there was held in the Treasury gold coin amounting to 138 , 441 , 547 , gold bullion amounting to 138 , 502 , 545 , silver bullion amounting to 93 , 359 , 250 , and other forms of money amounting to 451 , 963 , 981 . On the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circulation , or not included in Treasury holdings , was 1 , 886 , 879 , 504 , an increase for the year of 165 , 794 , 966 . Estimating our population at 75 , 194 , 000 at the time mentioned , the per capita circulation was 25 . 09 . On the same date there was in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to 138 , 502 , 545 . The provisions made for strengthening the resources of the Treasury in connection with the war have given increased confidence in the purpose and power of the Government to maintain the present standard , and have established more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad . A marked evidence of this is found in the inflow of gold to the Treasury . Its net gold holdings on November 1 , 1898 , were 239 , 885 , 162 as compared with 153 , 573 , 147 on November 1 , 1897 , and an increase of net cash of 207 , 756 , 100 , November 1 , 1897 , to 300 , 238 , 275 , November 1 , 1898 . The present ratio of net Treasury gold to outstanding Government liabilities , including United States notes , Treasury notes of 1890 , silver certificates , currency certificates , standard silver dollars , and fractional silver coin , November 1 , 1898 , was 25 . 35 per cent , as compared with 16 . 96 per cent , November 1 , 1897 . I renew so much of my recommendation of December , 1897 , as follows That when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold , such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold . This is an obvious duty . If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government , he should not receive back from the Government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it . The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the Government issues an interest bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes a non interest bearing debt . Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold . If they are put out in any other way , they may return again , to he followed by another bond issue to redeem them another interest bearing debt to redeem a non interest bearing debt . This recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree the safety of the present standard , and better protect our currency from the dangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the general business conditions of the country . In my judgment the present condition of the Treasury amply justifies the immediate enactment of the legislation recommended one year ago , under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation , but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold . It is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our currency is not required on the contrary , there is an obvious demand for it . The importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a money standard related as our money standard now is to that of our commercial rivals is generally recognized . The companion proposition that our domestic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internal commerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs is a proposition scarcely less important . The subject , in all its parts , is commended to the wise consideration of the Congress . The annexation of Hawaii and the changed relations of the United States to Cuba , Puerto Rico , and the Philippines resulting from the war , compel the prompt adoption of a maritime policy by the United States . There should be established regular and frequent steamship communication , encouraged by the United States , under the American flag , with the newly acquired islands . Spain furnished to its colonies , at an annual cost of about 2 , 000 , 000 , steamship lines communicating with a portion of the world s markets , as well as with trade centers of the home Government . The United States will not undertake to do less . It is our duty to furnish the people of Hawaii with facilities , under national control , for their export and import trade . It will be conceded that the present situation calls for legislation which shall be prompt , durable , and liberal . The part which American merchant vessels and their seamen performed in the war with Spain demonstrates that this service , furnishing both pickets and the second line of defense , is a national necessity , and should be encouraged in every constitutional way . Details and methods for the accomplishment of this purpose are discussed in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury , to which the attention of Congress is respectfully invited . In my last annual message I recommended that Congress authorize the appointment of a commission for the purpose of making systematic investigations with reference to the cause and prevention of yellow fever . This matter has acquired an increased importance as a result of the military occupation of the island of Cuba and the commercial intercourse between this island and the United States which we have every reason to expect . The sanitary problems connected with our new relations with the island of Cuba and the acquisition of Puerto Rico are no less important than those relating to finance , commerce , and administration . It is my earnest desire that these problems may be considered by competent experts and that everything may be done which the most recent advances in sanitary science can offer for the protection of the health of our soldiers in those islands and of our citizens who are exposed to the dangers of infection from the importation of yellow fever . I therefore renew my recommendation that the authority of Congress may be given and a suitable appropriation made to provide for a commission of experts to be appointed for the purpose indicated . Under the act of Congress approved April 26 , 1898 , authorizing the President in his discretion , upon a declaration of war by Congress , or a declaration by Congress that war exists , I directed the increase of the Regular Army to the maximum of 62 , 000 , authorized in said act . There are now in the Regular Army 57 , 862 officers and men . In said act it was provided That at the end of any war in which the United States may become involved the Army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer in the same arm of the service or absorption by promotion or honorable discharge , under such regulations as the Secretary of War may establish , of supernumerary commissioned officers and the honorable discharge or transfer of supernumerary enlisted men and nothing contained in this act shall be construed as authorizing the permanent increase of the commissioned or enlisted force of the Regular Army beyond that now provided by the law in force prior to the passage of this act , except as to the increase of twenty five majors provided for in section 1 hereof . The importance of legislation for the permanent increase of the Army is therefore manifest , and the recommendation of the Secretary of War for that purpose has my unqualified approval . There can be no question that at this time , and probably for some time in the future , 100 , 000 men will be none too many to meet the necessities of the situation . At all events , whether that number shall be required permanently or not , the power should be given to the President to enlist that force if in his discretion it should be necessary and the further discretion should be given him to recruit for the Army within the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the government of which we are charged . It is my purpose to muster out the entire Volunteer Army as soon as the Congress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment . This will be only an act of justice and will be much appreciated by the brave men who left their homes and employments to help the country in its emergency . In my last annual message I stated The Union Pacific Railway , main line , was sold under the decree of the United States court for the district of Nebraska on the 1st and 2d of November of this year . The amount due the Government consisted of the principal of the subsidy bonds , 27 , 236 , 512 , and the accrued interest thereon , 31 , 211 , 711 . 75 , making the total indebtedness 58 , 448 , 223 . 75 . The bid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgage claim of the Government , principal and interest . This left the Kansas Pacific case unconcluded . By a decree of the court in that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum which would yield to the Government only 2 , 500 , 000 upon its lien . The sale , at the instance of the Government , was postponed first to December 15 , 1897 , and later , upon the application of the United States , was postponed to the 16th day of February , 1898 . Having satisfied myself that the interests of the Government required that an effort should be made to obtain a larger sum , I directed the Secretary of the Treasury , under the act passed March 3 , 1887 , to pay out of the Treasury to the persons entitled to receive the same the amounts due upon all prior mortgages upon the Eastern and Middle divisions of said railroad out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated , whereupon the Attorney General prepared a petition to be presented to the court , offering to redeem said prior liens in such manner as the court might direct , and praying that thereupon the United States might be held to be subrogated to all the rights of said prior lien holders and that a receiver might be appointed to take possession of the mortgaged premises and maintain and operate the same until the court or Congress otherwise directed . Thereupon the reorganization committee agreed that if said petition was withdrawn and the sale allowed to proceed on the 16th of February , 1898 , they would bid a sum at the sale which would realize to the Government the entire principal of its debt , 6 , 303 , 000 . Believing that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the difficulties under which the Government would labor if it should become the purchaser of the road at the sale , in the absence of any authority by Congress to take charge of and operate the road I directed that upon the guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the Government the principal of its debt the sale should proceed . By this transaction the Government secured an advance of 3 , 803 , 000 over and above the sum which the court had fixed as the upset price , and which the reorganization committee had declared was the maximum which they would pay for the property . It is a gratifying fact that the result of these proceedings against the Union Pacific system and the Kansas Pacific line is that the Government has received on account of its subsidy claim the sum of 64 , 751 , 223 . 75 , an increase of 18 , 997 , 163 . 76 over the sum which the reorganization committee originally agreed to bid for the joint property , the Government receiving its whole claim , principal and interest , on the Union Pacific , and the principal of its debt on the Kansas Pacific Railroad . Steps had been taken to foreclose the Government s lien upon the Central Pacific Railroad Company , but before action was commenced Congress passed an act , approved July 7 , 1898 , creating a commission consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury , the Attorney General , and the Secretary of the Interior , and their successors in office , with full power to settle the indebtedness to the Government growing out of the issue of bonds in aid of the construction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific bond aided railroads , subject to the approval of the President . No report has yet been made to me by the commission thus created . Whatever action is had looking to a settlement of the indebtedness in accordance with the act referred to will be duly submitted to the Congress . I deem it my duty to call to the attention of Congress the condition of the present building occupied by the Department of Justice . The business of that Department has increased very greatly since it was established in its present quarters . The building now occupied by it is neither large enough nor of suitable arrangement for the proper accommodation of the business of the Department . The Supervising Architect has pronounced it unsafe and unsuited for the use to which it is put . The Attorney General in his report states that the library of the Department is upon the fourth floor , and that all the space allotted to it is so crowded with books as to dangerously overload the structure . The first floor is occupied by the Court of Claims . The building is of an old and dilapidated appearance , unsuited to the dignity which should attach to this important Department . A proper regard for the safety , comfort , and convenience of the officers and employees would justify the expenditure of a liberal sum of money in the erection of a new building of commodious proportions and handsome appearance upon the very advantageous site already secured for that purpose , including the ground occupied by the present structure and adjoining vacant lot , comprising in all a frontage of 201 feet on Pennsylvania avenue and a depth of 136 feet . In this connection I may likewise refer to the inadequate accommodations provided for the Supreme Court in the Capitol , and suggest the wisdom of making provision for the erection of a separate building for the court and its officers and library upon available ground near the Capitol . The postal service of the country advances with extraordinary growth . Within twenty years both the revenues and the expenditures of the Post Office Department have multiplied threefold . In the last ten years they have nearly doubled . Our postal business grows much more rapidly than our population . It now involves an expenditure of 100 , 000 , 000 a year , numbers 73 , 000 post offices , and enrolls 200 , 000 employees . This remarkable extension of a service which is an accurate index of the public conditions presents gratifying evidence of the advancement of education , of the increase of communication and business activity , and of the improvement of mail facilities leading to their constantly augmenting use . The war with Spain laid new and exceptional labors on the Post Office Department . The mustering of the military and naval forces of the United States required special mail arrangements for every camp and every campaign . The communication between home and camp was naturally eager and expectant . In some of the larger places of rendezvous as many as 50 , 000 letters a day required handling . This necessity was met by the prompt detail and dispatch of experienced men from the established force and by directing all the instrumentalities of the railway mail and post office service , so far as necessary , to this new need . Congress passed an act empowering the postmaster General to establish offices or branches at every military camp or station , and under this authority the postal machinery was speedily put into effective operation . Under the same authority , when our forces moved upon Cuba , Puerto Rico , and the Philippines they were attended and followed by the postal service . Though the act of Congress authorized the appointment of postmasters where necessary , it was early determined that the public interests would best be subserved , not by new designations , but by the detail of experienced men familiar with every branch of the service , and this policy was steadily followed . When the territory which was the theater of conflict came into our possession , it became necessary to reestablish mail facilities for the resident population as well as to provide them for our forces of occupation , and the former requirement was met through the extension and application of the latter obligation . I gave the requisite authority , and the same general principle was applied to this as to other branches of civil administration under military occupation . The details are more particularly given in the report of the postmaster General , and , while the work is only just begun , it is pleasing to be able to say that the service in the territory which has come under our control is already materially improved . The following recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy relative to the increase of the Navy have my earnest approval 1 . Three seagoing sheathed and coppered battle ships of about 13 , 500 tons trial displacement , carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class , and to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of action . Estimated cost , exclusive of armor and armament , 3 , 600 , 000 each . 2 . Three sheathed and coppered armored cruisers of about 12 , 000 tons trial displacement , carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class , and to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of action . Estimated cost , exclusive of armor and armament , 4 , 000 , 000 each . 3 . Three sheathed and coppered protected cruisers of about 6 , 000 tons trial displacement , to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of action , and to carry the most powerful ordnance suitable for vessels of their class . Estimated cost , exclusive of armor and armament , 2 , 150 , 000 each . 4 . Six sheathed and coppered cruisers of about 2 , 500 tons trial dis . placement , to have the highest speed compatible with good cruising qualities , great radius of action , and to carry the most powerful ordnance suited to vessels of their class . Estimated cost , exclusive of armament , 1 , 141 , 800 each . I join with the Secretary of the Navy in recommending that grades of admiral and vice admiral be temporarily revived , to be filled by officers who have specially distinguished themselves in the war with Spain . I earnestly urge upon Congress the importance of early legislation providing for the taking of the Twelfth Census . This is necessary in view of the large amount of work which must be performed in the preparation of the schedules preparatory to the enumeration of the population . There were on the pension rolls on June 30 , 1898 , 993 , 714 names , an increase of nearly 18 , 000 over the number on the rolls on the same day of the preceding year . The amount appropriated by the act of December 22 , 1896 , for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year of 1898 was 140 , 000 , 000 . Eight million seventy thousand eight hundred and seventy two dollars and forty six cents was appropriated by the act of March 31 , 1898 , to cover deficiencies in army pensions , and repayments in the sum of 12 , 020 . 33 , making a total of 148 , 082 , 892 . 79 available for the payment of pensions during the fiscal year 1898 . The amount disbursed from that sum was 144 , 651 , 879 . 80 , leaving a balance of 3 , 431 , 012 . 99 unexpended on the 30th of June , 1898 , which was covered into the Treasury . There were 389 names added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at the second session of the Fifty fifth Congress , making a total of 6 , 486 pensioners by Congressional enactments since 1861 . The total receipts of the Patent Office during the past year were 1 , 253 , 948 . 44 . The expenditures were 1 , 081 , 633 . 79 , leaving a surplus of 172 , 314 . 65 . The public lands disposed of by the Government during the year reached 8 , 453 , 896 . 92 acres , an increase of 614 , 780 . 26 acres over the previous year . The total receipts from public lands during the fiscal year amounted to 2 , 277 , 995 . 18 , an increase of 190 , 063 . 90 over the preceding year . The lands embraced in the eleven forest reservations which were suspended by the act of June 4 , 1897 , again became subject to the operations of the proclamations of February 22 , 1897 , creating them , which added an estimated amount of 19 , 951 , 360 acres to the area embraced in the reserves previously created . In addition thereto two new reserves were created during the year the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Reserve , in California , embracing 1 , 644 , 594 acres , and the Prescott Reserve , in Arizona , embracing 10 , 240 acres while the Pecos River Reserve , in New Mexico , has been changed and enlarged to include 120 , 000 additional acres . At the close of the year thirty forest reservations , not including those of the Afognak Forest and the Fish Culture Reserve , in Alaska , had been created by Executive proclamations under section 24 of the act of March 3 , 1891 , embracing an estimated area of 40 , 719 , 474 acres . The Department of the Interior has inaugurated a forest system , made possible by the act of July , 1898 , for a graded force of officers in control of the reserves . This system has only been in full operation since August , but good results have already been secured in many sections . The reports received indicate that the system of patrol has not only prevented destructive fires from gaining headway , but has diminished the number of fires . The special attention of the Congress is called to that part of the report of the Secretary of the Interior in relation to the Five Civilized Tribes . It is noteworthy that the general condition of the Indians shows marked progress . But one outbreak of a serious character occurred during the year , and that among the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota , which happily has been suppressed . While it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions of the act of June 28 , 1898 , for the protection of the people of the Indian Territory , and for other purposes , it is having a salutary effect upon the nations composing the five tribes . The Dawes Commission reports that the most gratifying results and greater advance toward the attainment of the objects of the Government have been secured in the past year than in any previous year . I can not too strongly indorse the recommendation of the commission and of the Secretary of the Interior for the necessity of providing for the education of the 30 , 000 white children resident in the Indian Territory . The Department of Agriculture has been active in the past year . Explorers have been sent to many of the countries of the Eastern and Western hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the United States , and with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products . The Forestry Division of the Department is giving special attention to the treeless regions of our country and is introducing species specially adapted to semiarid regions . Forest fires , which seriously interfere with production , especially in irrigated regions , are being studied , that losses from this cause may be avoided . The Department is inquiring into the use and abuse of water in many States of the West , and collating information regarding the laws of the States , the decisions of the courts , and the customs of the people in this regard , so that uniformity may be secured . Experiment stations are becoming more effective every year . The annual appropriation of 720 , 000 by Congress is supplemented by 400 , 000 from the States . Nation wide experiments have been conducted to ascertain the suitableness as to soil and climate and States for growing sugar beets . The number of sugar factories has been doubled in the past two years , and the ability of the United States to produce its own sugar from this source has been clearly demonstrated . The Weather Bureau forecast and observation stations have been extended around the Caribbean Sea , to give early warning of the approach of hurricanes from the south seas to our fleets and merchant marine . In the year 1900 will occur the centennial anniversary of the founding of the city of Washington for the permanent capital of the Government of the United States by authority of an act of Congress approved July 16 , 1790 . In May , 1800 , the archives and general offices of the Federal Government were removed to this place . On the 17th of November , 1800 , the National Congress met here for the first time and assumed exclusive control of the Federal district and city . This interesting event assumes all the more significance when we recall the circumstances attending the choosing of the site , the naming of the capital in honor of the Father of his Country , and the interest taken by him in the adoption of plans for its future development on a magnificent scale . These original plans have been wrought out with a constant progress and a signal success even beyond anything their framers could have foreseen . The people of the country are justly proud of the distinctive beauty and government of the capital and of the rare instruments of science and education which here find their natural home . A movement lately inaugurated by the citizens to have the anniversary celebrated with fitting ceremonies , including , perhaps , the establishment of a handsome permanent memorial to mark so historical an occasion and to give it more than local recognition , has met with general favor on the part of the public . I recommend to the Congress the granting of an appropriation for this purpose and the appointment of a committee from its respective bodies . It might also be advisable to authorize the President to appoint a committee from the country at large , which , acting with the Congressional and District of Columbia committees , can complete the plans for an appropriate national celebration . The alien contract law is shown by experience to need some amendment a measure providing better protection for seamen is proposed the rightful application of the eight hour law for the benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration are suggested for consideration and I commend these subjects to the careful attention of the Congress . The several departmental reports will be laid before you . They give in great detail the conduct of the affairs of the Government during the past year and discuss many questions upon which the Congress may feel called upon to act .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens In obedience to the will of the people , and in their presence , by the authority vested in me by this oath , I assume the arduous and responsible duties of President of the United States , relying upon the support of my countrymen and invoking the guidance of Almighty God . Our faith teaches that there is no safer reliance than upon the God of our fathers , who has so singularly favored the American people in every national trial , and who will not forsake us so long as we obey His commandments and walk humbly in His footsteps . The responsibilities of the high trust to which I have been called always of grave importance are augmented by the prevailing business conditions entailing idleness upon willing labor and loss to useful enterprises . The country is suffering from industrial disturbances from which speedy relief must be had . Our financial system needs some revision our money is all good now , but its value must not further be threatened . It should all be put upon an enduring basis , not subject to easy attack , nor its stability to doubt or dispute . Our currency should continue under the supervision of the Government . The several forms of our paper money offer , in my judgment , a constant embarrassment to the Government and a safe balance in the Treasury . Therefore I believe it necessary to devise a system which , without diminishing the circulating medium or offering a premium for its contraction , will present a remedy for those arrangements which , temporary in their nature , might well in the years of our prosperity have been displaced by wiser provisions . With adequate revenue secured , but not until then , we can enter upon such changes in our fiscal laws as will , while insuring safety and volume to our money , no longer impose upon the Government the necessity of maintaining so large a gold reserve , with its attendant and inevitable temptations to speculation . Most of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial , and should not be amended without investigation and demonstration of the wisdom of the proposed changes . We must be both sure we are right and make haste slowly . If , therefore , Congress , in its wisdom , shall deem it expedient to create a commission to take under early consideration the revision of our coinage , banking and currency laws , and give them that exhaustive , careful and dispassionate examination that their importance demands , I shall cordially concur in such action . If such power is vested in the President , it is my purpose to appoint a commission of prominent , well informed citizens of different parties , who will command public confidence , both on account of their ability and special fitness for the work . Business experience and public training may thus be combined , and the patriotic zeal of the friends of the country be so directed that such a report will be made as to receive the support of all parties , and our finances cease to be the subject of mere partisan contention . The experiment is , at all events , worth a trial , and , in my opinion , it can but prove beneficial to the entire country . The question of international bimetallism will have early and earnest attention . It will be my constant endeavor to secure it by co operation with the other great commercial powers of the world . Until that condition is realized when the parity between our gold and silver money springs from and is supported by the relative value of the two metals , the value of the silver already coined and of that which may hereafter be coined , must be kept constantly at par with gold by every resource at our command . The credit of the Government , the integrity of its currency , and the inviolability of its obligations must be preserved . This was the commanding verdict of the people , and it will not be unheeded . Economy is demanded in every branch of the Government at all times , but especially in periods , like the present , of depression in business and distress among the people . The severest economy must be observed in all public expenditures , and extravagance stopped wherever it is found , and prevented wherever in the future it may be developed . If the revenues are to remain as now , the only relief that can come must be from decreased expenditures . But the present must not become the permanent condition of the Government . It has been our uniform practice to retire , not increase our outstanding obligations , and this policy must again be resumed and vigorously enforced . Our revenues should always be large enough to meet with ease and promptness not only our current needs and the principal and interest of the public debt , but to make proper and liberal provision for that most deserving body of public creditors , the soldiers and sailors and the widows and orphans who are the pensioners of the United States . The Government should not be permitted to run behind or increase its debt in times like the present . Suitably to provide against this is the mandate of duty the certain and easy remedy for most of our financial difficulties . A deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of the Government exceed its receipts . It can only be met by loans or an increased revenue . While a large annual surplus of revenue may invite waste and extravagance , inadequate revenue creates distrust and undermines public and private credit . Neither should be encouraged . Between more loans and more revenue there ought to be but one opinion . We should have more revenue , and that without delay , hindrance , or postponement . A surplus in the Treasury created by loans is not a permanent or safe reliance . It will suffice while it lasts , but it can not last long while the outlays of the Government are greater than its receipts , as has been the case during the past two years . Nor must it be forgotten that however much such loans may temporarily relieve the situation , the Government is still indebted for the amount of the surplus thus accrued , which it must ultimately pay , while its ability to pay is not strengthened , but weakened by a continued deficit . Loans are imperative in great emergencies to preserve the Government or its credit , but a failure to supply needed revenue in time of peace for the maintenance of either has no justification . The best way for the Government to maintain its credit is to pay as it goes not by resorting to loans , but by keeping out of debt through an adequate income secured by a system of taxation , external or internal , or both . It is the settled policy of the Government , pursued from the beginning and practiced by all parties and Administrations , to raise the bulk of our revenue from taxes upon foreign productions entering the United States for sale and consumption , and avoiding , for the most part , every form of direct taxation , except in time of war . The country is clearly opposed to any needless additions to the subject of internal taxation , and is committed by its latest popular utterance to the system of tariff taxation . There can be no misunderstanding , either , about the principle upon which this tariff taxation shall be levied . Nothing has ever been made plainer at a general election than that the controlling principle in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous care for American interests and American labor . The people have declared that such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and the development of our country . It is , therefore , earnestly hoped and expected that Congress will , at the earliest practicable moment , enact revenue legislation that shall be fair , reasonable , conservative , and just , and which , while supplying sufficient revenue for public purposes , will still be signally beneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the people . To this policy we are all , of whatever party , firmly bound by the voice of the people a power vastly more potential than the expression of any political platform . The paramount duty of Congress is to stop deficiencies by the restoration of that protective legislation which has always been the firmest prop of the Treasury . The passage of such a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the Government both at home and abroad , and go far toward stopping the drain upon the gold reserve held for the redemption of our currency , which has been heavy and well nigh constant for several years . In the revision of the tariff especial attention should be given to the re enactment and extension of the reciprocity principle of the law of 1890 , under which so great a stimulus was given to our foreign trade in new and advantageous markets for our surplus agricultural and manufactured products . The brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercial treaties , the end in view always to be the opening up of new markets for the products of our country , by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce ourselves , and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people , but tend to increase their employment . The depression of the past four years has fallen with especial severity upon the great body of toilers of the country , and upon none more than the holders of small farms . Agriculture has languished and labor suffered . The revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both . No portion of our population is more devoted to the institution of free government nor more loyal in their support , while none bears more cheerfully or fully its proper share in the maintenance of the Government or is better entitled to its wise and liberal care and protection . Legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all . The depressed condition of industry on the farm and in the mine and factory has lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon them , and they rightfully expect that not only a system of revenue shall be established that will secure the largest income with the least burden , but that every means will be taken to decrease , rather than increase , our public expenditures . Business conditions are not the most promising . It will take time to restore the prosperity of former years . If we cannot promptly attain it , we can resolutely turn our faces in that direction and aid its return by friendly legislation . However troublesome the situation may appear , Congress will not , I am sure , be found lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it as far as legislation can do so . The restoration of confidence and the revival of business , which men of all parties so much desire , depend more largely upon the prompt , energetic , and intelligent action of Congress than upon any other single agency affecting the situation . It is inspiring , too , to remember that no great emergency in the one hundred and eight years of our eventful national life has ever arisen that has not been met with wisdom and courage by the American people , with fidelity to their best interests and highest destiny , and to the honor of the American name . These years of glorious history have exalted mankind and advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world , and immeasurably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy . The people love and will sustain these institutions . The great essential to our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon which the Government was established and insist upon their faithful observance . Equality of rights must prevail , and our laws be always and everywhere respected and obeyed . We may have failed in the discharge of our full duty as citizens of the great Republic , but it is consoling and encouraging to realize that free speech , a free press , free thought , free schools , the free and unmolested right of religious liberty and worship , and free and fair elections are dearer and more universally enjoyed to day than ever before . These guaranties must be sacredly preserved and wisely strengthened . The constituted authorities must be cheerfully and vigorously upheld . Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States courts , not mobs , must execute the penalties of the law . The preservation of public order , the right of discussion , the integrity of courts , and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our Government securely rests . One of the lessons taught by the late election , which all can rejoice in , is that the citizens of the United States are both law respecting and law abiding people , not easily swerved from the path of patriotism and honor . This is in entire accord with the genius of our institutions , and but emphasizes the advantages of inculcating even a greater love for law and order in the future . Immunity should be granted to none who violate the laws , whether individuals , corporations , or communities and as the Constitution imposes upon the President the duty of both its own execution , and of the statutes enacted in pursuance of its provisions , I shall endeavor carefully to carry them into effect . The declaration of the party now restored to power has been in the past that of opposition to all combinations of capital organized in trusts , or otherwise , to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens , and it has supported such legislation as will prevent the execution of all schemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies , or by unjust rates for the transportation of their products to the market . This purpose will be steadily pursued , both by the enforcement of the laws now in existence and the recommendation and support of such new statutes as may be necessary to carry it into effect . Our naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to the constant promotion of a safer , a better , and a higher citizenship . A grave peril to the Republic would be a citizenship too ignorant to understand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence of our institutions and laws , and against all who come here to make war upon them our gates must be promptly and tightly closed . Nor must we be unmindful of the need of improvement among our own citizens , but with the zeal of our forefathers encourage the spread of knowledge and free education . Illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain that high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the world which , under Providence , we ought to achieve . Reforms in the civil service must go on but the changes should be real and genuine , not perfunctory , or prompted by a zeal in behalf of any party simply because it happens to be in power . As a member of Congress I voted and spoke in favor of the present law , and I shall attempt its enforcement in the spirit in which it was enacted . The purpose in view was to secure the most efficient service of the best men who would accept appointment under the Government , retaining faithful and devoted public servants in office , but shielding none , under the authority of any rule or custom , who are inefficient , incompetent , or unworthy . The best interests of the country demand this , and the people heartily approve the law wherever and whenever it has been thus administrated . Congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our American merchant marine , once the pride of the seas in all the great ocean highways of commerce . To my mind , few more important subjects so imperatively demand its intelligent consideration . The United States has progressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise and endeavor until we have become foremost in nearly all the great lines of inland trade , commerce , and industry . Yet , while this is true , our American merchant marine has been steadily declining until it is now lower , both in the percentage of tonnage and the number of vessels employed , than it was prior to the Civil War . Commendable progress has been made of late years in the upbuilding of the American Navy , but we must supplement these efforts by providing as a proper consort for it a merchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade to foreign countries . The question is one that appeals both to our business necessities and the patriotic aspirations of a great people . It has been the policy of the United States since the foundation of the Government to cultivate relations of peace and amity with all the nations of the world , and this accords with my conception of our duty now . We have cherished the policy of non interference with affairs of foreign governments wisely inaugurated by Washington , keeping ourselves free from entanglement , either as allies or foes , content to leave undisturbed with them the settlement of their own domestic concerns . It will be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign policy , which shall be just , impartial , ever watchful of our national honor , and always insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of American citizens everywhere . Our diplomacy should seek nothing more and accept nothing less than is due us . We want no wars of conquest we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression . War should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed peace is preferable to war in almost every contingency . Arbitration is the true method of settlement of international as well as local or individual differences . It was recognized as the best means of adjustment of differences between employers and employees by the Forty ninth Congress , in 1886 , and its application was extended to our diplomatic relations by the unanimous concurrence of the Senate and House of the Fifty first Congress in 1890 . The latter resolution was accepted as the basis of negotiations with us by the British House of Commons in 1893 , and upon our invitation a treaty of arbitration between the United States and Great Britain was signed at Washington and transmitted to the Senate for its ratification in January last . Since this treaty is clearly the result of our own initiative since it has been recognized as the leading feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire national history the adjustment of difficulties by judicial methods rather than force of arms and since it presents to the world the glorious example of reason and peace , not passion and war , controlling the relations between two of the greatest nations in the world , an example certain to be followed by others , I respectfully urge the early action of the Senate thereon , not merely as a matter of policy , but as a duty to mankind . The importance and moral influence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly be overestimated in the cause of advancing civilization . It may well engage the best thought of the statesmen and people of every country , and I cannot but consider it fortunate that it was reserved to the United States to have the leadership in so grand a work . It has been the uniform practice of each President to avoid , as far as possible , the convening of Congress in extraordinary session . It is an example which , under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of a public necessity , is to be commended . But a failure to convene the representatives of the people in Congress in extra session when it involves neglect of a public duty places the responsibility of such neglect upon the Executive himself . The condition of the public Treasury , as has been indicated , demands the immediate consideration of Congress . It alone has the power to provide revenues for the Government . Not to convene it under such circumstances I can view in no other sense than the neglect of a plain duty . I do not sympathize with the sentiment that Congress in session is dangerous to our general business interests . Its members are the agents of the people , and their presence at the seat of Government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate as an injury , but a benefit . There could be no better time to put the Government upon a sound financial and economic basis than now . The people have only recently voted that this should be done , and nothing is more binding upon the agents of their will than the obligation of immediate action . It has always seemed to me that the postponement of the meeting of Congress until more than a year after it has been chosen deprived Congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and the country of the corresponding benefits . It is evident , therefore , that to postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would be unwise on the part of the Executive because unjust to the interests of the people . Our action now will be freer from mere partisan consideration than if the question of tariff revision was postponed until the regular session of Congress . We are nearly two years from a Congressional election , and politics cannot so greatly distract us as if such contest was immediately pending . We can approach the problem calmly and patriotically , without fearing its effect upon an early election . Our fellow citizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this legislation prefer to have the question settled now , even against their preconceived views , and perhaps settled so reasonably , as I trust and believe it will be , as to insure great permanence , than to have further uncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the United States . Again , whatever action Congress may take will be given a fair opportunity for trial before the people are called to pass judgment upon it , and this I consider a great essential to the rightful and lasting settlement of the question . In view of these considerations , I shall deem it my duty as President to convene Congress in extraordinary session on Monday , the 15th day of March , 1897 . In conclusion , I congratulate the country upon the fraternal spirit of the people and the manifestations of good will everywhere so apparent . The recent election not only most fortunately demonstrated the obliteration of sectional or geographical lines , but to some extent also the prejudices which for years have distracted our councils and marred our true greatness as a nation . The triumph of the people , whose verdict is carried into effect today , is not the triumph of one section , nor wholly of one party , but of all sections and all the people . The North and the South no longer divide on the old lines , but upon principles and policies and in this fact surely every lover of the country can find cause for true felicitation . Let us rejoice in and cultivate this spirit it is ennobling and will be both a gain and a blessing to our beloved country . It will be my constant aim to do nothing , and permit nothing to be done , that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation , this revival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections , but I shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase it . Let me again repeat the words of the oath administered by the Chief Justice which , in their respective spheres , so far as applicable , I would have all my countrymen observe I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will , to the best of my ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . This is the obligation I have reverently taken before the Lord Most High . To keep it will be my single purpose , my constant prayer and I shall confidently rely upon the forbearance and assistance of all the people in the discharge of my solemn responsibilities .<speech_sep>To the Congress of the United States Obedient to that precept of the Constitution which commands the President to give from time to time to the congress information of the state of Union and to recommend to their consideration such measures as shall be judged necessary and expedient , it becomes my duty now to address your body with regard to the grave crisis that has arisen in the relations of the United States to Spain by reason of the warfare that for more than three years has raged in the neighboring island of Cuba . I do so because of the intimate connection of the Cuban question with the state of our own Union and the grave relation the course which it is now incumbent upon the nation to adopt must needs bear to the traditional policy of our Government if it is to accord with the precepts laid down by the founders of the Republic and religiously observed by succeeding Administrations to the present day . The present revolution is but the successor of other similar insurrections which have occurred in Cuba against the dominion of Spain , extending over a period of nearly half a century , each of which , during its progress , has subjected the United States to great effort and expense in enforcing its neutrality laws , caused enormous losses to American trade and commerce caused irritation , annoyance , and disturbance among our citizens , and by the exercise of cruel , barbarous , and uncivilized practices of warfare , shocked the sensibilities and offended the humane sympathies of our people . Since the present revolution began in February , 1895 , this country has seen the fertile domain at our threshold ravaged by fire and sword in the course of a struggle unequaled in the history of the island and rarely paralleled as to the numbers of the combatants and the bitterness of the contest by any revolution of modern times where dependent people striving to be free have been opposed by the power of the sovereign state . Our people have beheld a once prosperous community reduced to comparative want , its lucrative commerce virtually paralyzed , its exceptional productiveness diminished , its fields laid waste , its mills in ruins , and its people perishing by tens of thousands from hunger and destitution . We have found ourselves constrained , in the observance of that strict neutrality which our laws enjoin , and which the law of nations commands , to police our own waters and watch our own seaports in prevention of any unlawful act in aid of the Cubans . Our trade has suffered the capital invested by our citizens in Cuba has been largely lost , and the temper and forbearance of our people have been so sorely tried as to beget a perilous unrest among our own citizens which has inevitably found its expression from time to time in the National Legislature , so that issues wholly external to our own body politic engross attention and stand in the way of the close devotion to domestic advancement that becomes a self contained commonwealth whose primal maxim has been the avoidance of all foreign entanglements . All this must need awaken , and has , indeed , aroused the utmost concern on the part of this Government , as well during my predecessor s term as in my own . In April , 1896 , the evils from which our company suffered through the Cuban war became so onerous that my predecessor made an effort to bring about a peace through the mediation of this Government in any way that might tend to an honorable adjustment of the contest between Spain and her revolted colony , on the basis of some effective scheme of self government of Cuba under the flag and sovereignty of Spain . It failed through the refusal of the Spanish Government then in power to consider any form of mediation or , indeed , any plan of settlement which did not begin with the actual submission of the insurgents to the mother country , and the only on such term as Spain herself might see fit to grant . The war continued unabated . The resistance of the insurgents was in no wise diminished . The efforts of Spain were increased , both by the dispatch of fresh levies to Cuba and by the addition to the horrors of the strife of a new and inhuman phase happily unprecedented in the modern history of civilized Christian peoples . The policy of devastation and concentration , inaugurated by the Captain General s bando of October 21 , 1896 , in the Province of Pinar del Rio was thence extended to embrace all of the island to which the power of the Spanish arms was able to reach by occupation or by military operations . The peasantry , including all dwelling in the open agricultural interior , were driven into the garrison towns or isolated places held by the troops . The raising and movement of provisions of all kinds were interdicted . The fields ware laid waste , dwellings unroofed and fired , mills destroyed , and , in short , everything that could desolate the land and render it unfit for human habitation or support was commanded by one or the other of the contending parties and executed by all the powers at their disposal . By the time the present administration took office a year ago , reconcentration so called had been made effective over the better part of the four central and western provinces , Santa Clara , Matanzas , Havana , Pinar del Rio . The agricultural population to the estimated number of 300 , 000 or more was herded within the towns and their immediate vicinage , deprived of the means of support , rendered destitute of shelter , left poorly clad , and exposed to the most unsanitary conditions . As the scarcity of food increased with the devastation of the depopulated areas of production , destitution and want became misery and starvation . Month by month the death rate increased in an alarming ration . By March , 1897 , according to conservative estimates from official Spanish sources , the mortality among the reconcentrados from starvation and the diseases thereto incident exceeded 50 per centum of their total number . No practical relief was accorded to the destitute . The overburdened towns , already suffering from the general dearth , could give no aid . So called zones of cultivation established within the immediate areas of effective military control about the cities and fortified camps proved illusory as a remedy for the suffering . The unfortunates , being for the most part women and children , with aged and helpless men , enfeebled by disease and hunger , could not have tilled the soil without tools , seed , or shelter for their own support or for the supply of the cities . Reconcentration , adopted avowedly as a ware measure in order to cut off the resources of the insurgents , worked its predestined result . As I said in my message of last December , it was not civilized warfare it was extermination . The only peace it could beget was that of the wilderness and the grave . Meanwhile the military situation in the island had undergone a noticeable change . The extraordinary activity that characterized the second year of the war , when the insurgents invaded even the thitherto unharmed fields of Pinar del Rio and carried havoc and destruction up to the walls of the city of Havana itself , had relapsed into a dogged struggle in the central and eastern provinces . The Spanish arms regained a measure of control in Pinar del Rio and parts of Havana , but , under the existing conditions of the rural country , without immediate improvement of their productive situation . Even thus partially restricted , the revolutionists held their own , and their conquest and submission , put forward by Spain as the essential and sole basis of peace , seemed as far distant as at the outset . In this state of affairs my Administration found itself confronted with the grave problem of its duty . My message of last December reviewed the situation and narrated the steps take with a view to relieving its acuteness and opening the way to some from of honorable settlement . The assassination of the Prime Minister , Canovas , led to a change of government in Spain . The former administration , pledged to subjugation without concession , gave place to that of a more liberal party , committed long in advance to a policy of reform , involving the wider principle of home rule for Cuba and Puerto Rico . The overtures of this Government , made through its new envoy , General Woodford , and looking to an immediate and effective amelioration of the condition of the island , although not accepted to the extent of the condition of the island , although not accepted to the extent of admitted mediation in any shape , were met by assurances that home rule , in advanced phase , would be forthwith offered to Cuba , without waiting for the war to end , and that more humane methods should thenceforth prevail in the conduct of hostilities . Coincidentally with these declarations , the new Government of Spain continued and completed the policy already begun by its predecessor , of testifying friendly regard for this nation by releasing American citizens held under one charge or another connected with the insurrection , so that by the end of November not a single person entitled in any way to our national protection remained in a Spanish prison . While these negotiations were in progress the increasing destitution of the unfortunate reconcentrados and alarming mortality among them claimed earnest attention . The success which had attended the limited measure of relief extended to the suffering American citizens among them by the judicious expenditure through the consular agencies of the money appropriated expressly for their succor by the joint resolution approved May 24 , 1897 , prompted the humane extension of a similar scheme of aid to the great body of sufferers . A suggestion to this end was acquiesced in by the Spanish authorities . On the 24th of December last I caused to be issued an appeal to the American people , inviting contributions in money or in kind for the succor of the starving sufferers in Cuba , following this on the 8th of January by a similar public announcement of the formation of a central Cuban relief committee , with headquarters in New York City , composed of three members representing the American National Red Cross and the religious and business elements of the community . The efforts of that committee have been untiring and have accomplished much . Arrangements for free transportation to Cuba have greatly aided the charitable work . The president of the American Red Cross and representative of other contributory organizations have generously visited Cuba and cooperated with the consul general and the local authorities to make effective distribution of the relief collected through the efforts of the central committee . Nearly 200 , 000 in money and supplies has already reached the sufferers and more is forthcoming . The supplies are admitted duty free , and transportation to the interior has been arranged so that the relief , at first necessarily confined to Havana and the larger cities , is now extended through most if not all of the towns where suffering exists . Thousands of lives have already been saved . The necessity for change in the condition of the reconcentrados is recognized by the Spanish Government . Within a few days past the orders of General Weyler have been revoked the reconcentrados , it is said , are to be permitted to return to their homes and aided to resume the self supporting pursuits of peace . Public works have been ordered to give them employment , and a sum of 600 , 000 has been appropriated for their relief . The war in Cuba is of such a nature that short of subjugation or extermination a final military victory for either side seems impracticable . The alternative lies in the physical exhaustion of the one or the other party , or perhaps of both a condition which in effect ended the ten year s war by the truce of Zanjon . The prospect of such a protraction and conclusion of the present strife is a contingency hardly to be contemplated with equanimity by the civilized world , and least of all by the United States , affected and injured as we are , deeply and intimately , by its very existence . Realizing this , it appeared to be my duty , in a spirit of true friendliness , no less to Spain than the Cubans who have so much to lose by the prolongation of the struggle , to seek to bring about on immediate termination of the war . To this end I submitted , on the 27th ultimo , as a result of much representation and correspondence , through the United States minister at Madrid , propositions to the Spanish Government looking to an armistice until October 1 for the negotiation of peace with the good offices of the President . In addition , I asked the immediate revocation of the order of reconcentration , so as to permit the people to return to their farms and the needy to be relieved with provisions and supplies from the United States , cooperating with the Spanish authorities , so as to afford full relief . The reply of the Spanish cabinet was received on the night of the 31st ultimo . It offered , as the means to bring about peace in Cuba , to confide the preparation thereof to the insular parliament , inasmuch as the concurrence of that body would be necessary to reach a final result , it being , however , understood that the powers reserved by the constitution to the central Government are not lessened or diminished . As the Cuban parliament does not meet until the 4th of May next , the Spanish Government would not object , for its part , to accept at one a suspension of hostilities if asked for by the insurgents from the general in chief , to whom it would pertain , in such case , to determine the duration and conditions of the armistice . The propositions submitted by General Woodford and the reply of the Spanish Government were both in the form or brief memoranda , the texts of which are before me , and are substantially in the language above given . The function of the Cuban parliament in the matter of preparing peace and the manner of its doing so are not expressed in the Spanish memorandum but from General Woodford s explanatory reports of preliminary discussions preceding the final conference it is understood that the Spanish Government stands ready to give the insular congress full powers to settle the terms of peace with the insurgents whether by direct negotiation or indirectly by means of legislation does not appear . With this last overture in the direction of immediate peace , and its disappointing reception by Spain , the Executive is brought to the end of his effort . In my annual message of December last I said Of the untried measures there remained only Recognition of the insurgents as belligerents recognition of the independence of Cuba neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a national a rational compromise between the contestants , and intervention in favor of one or the other party . I speak not of forcible annexation , for that can not be thought of . That , by our code of morality , would be criminal aggression . Thereupon I reviewed these alternatives , in the light of President Grant s measured words , uttered in 1875 , when after seven years of sanguinary , destructive , and cruel hostilities in Cuba he reached the conclusion that the recognition of the independence of Cuba was impracticable and indefensible , and that the recognition of belligerence was not warranted by the facts according to the tests of public law . I commented especially upon the latter aspect of the question , pointing out the inconveniences and positive dangers of a recognition of belligerence which , while adding to the already onerous burdens of neutrality within our own jurisdiction , could not in any way extend our influence or effective offices in the territory of hostilities . Nothing has since occurred to change my view in this regard , and I recognize as fully now as then that the issuance of a proclamation of neutrality , by which process the so called recognition of belligerents is published , could , of itself and unattended by other action , accomplish nothing toward the one end for which we labor the instant pacification of Cuba and cessation of the misery that afflicts the island . Turning to the question of recognizing at this time the independence of the present insurgent government in Cuba , we find safe precedents in our history from an early day . They are well summed up in President Jackson s message to Congress , December 21 , 1836 , on the subject of the recognition of the independence of Texas . He said In all the contest that have arisen out of the revolution of France , out of the disputes relating to the Crowns of Portugal and Spain , out of the separation of the American possessions of both from the European Governments , and out of the numerous and constantly occurring struggles for dominion in Spanish America , so wisely consistent with our just principles has been the action of our Government , that we have , under the most critical circumstances , avoided all censure , and encountered no other evil than the produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against whom we have been by force of evidence compelled to decide . It has thus made known to the world that the uniform policy and practice of the United States is to avoid all interference in disputes which merely relate to the internal government of other nations , and eventually to recognize the authority of the prevailing party without reference to our particular interests and views or to the merits of the original controversy . . . . But on this , as on every other trying occasion , safety is to be found in a rigid adherence to principle . In the contest between Spain and the revolted colonies we stood aloof , and waited not only until the ability of the new States to protect themselves was fully established , but until the danger of their being again subjugated had entirely passed away . Then , and not until then , were they recognized . Such was our course in regard to Mexico herself . . . . It is true that with defeated , the chief of the Republic himself captured , and all present power to control the newly organized government of Texas annihilated within its confines but , on the other hand , there is , in appearance , at least , an immense disparity of physical force on the side of Texas . The Mexican Republic , under another executive , is rallying its forces under a new lender and menacing a fresh invasion to recover its lost dominion . Upon the issue of this threatened invasion the independence of Texas may be considered as suspended and were there nothing peculiar in the relative situation of the United States and Texas , our acknowledgment of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regarded as consistent with the prudent reserve with which we have hitherto held ourselves bound to treat all similar questions . Thereupon Andrew Jackson proceeded to consider the risk that there might be imputed to the United States motives of selfish interest in view of the former claim on our part to the territory of Texas , and of the avowed purpose of the Texas in seeking recognition of independence as an incident to the incorporation of Texas into the Union , concluding thus Prudence , therefore , seems to dictate that we should still stand aloof and maintain our present attitude , if not until Mexico itself or one of the great foreign powers shall recognize the independence of the new government , at least until the lapse of time or the course of events shall have proved beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of that country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the government constituted by them . Neither of the contending parties can justly complain of this course . By pursuing it we are but carrying out the long established policy of our Government , a policy which has secured to us respect and influence abroad and inspired confidence at home . These are the words of the resolute and patriotic Jackson . They are evidence that the United States , in addition to the test imposed by public law as the condition of the recognition of independence by a neutral state to wit , that the revolted state shall constitute in fact a body politic , having a government in substance as well as in name , possessed of the elements of stability , and forming de facto , if left to itself , a state among the nations , reasonably capable of discharging the duties of a state , has imposed for its own governance in dealing with cases like these the further condition that recognition of independent statehood is not due to a revolted dependency until the danger of its being again subjugated by the parent state has entirely passed away . This extreme test was , in fact , applied in the case of Texas . The Congress to whom President Jackson referred the question as one probably leading to war , and therefore a proper subject for a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be declared and by whom all the provisions for sustaining its perils must be furnished , left the matter of the recognition of Texas to the discretion of the Executive , providing merely for the sending of a diplomatic agent when the President should be satisfied that the Republic of Texas had become an independent State . It was so recognized by President Van Buren , who commissioned a charge d affaires March 7 , 1837 , after Mexico had abandoned an attempt to reconquer the Texan territory , and when there was at the time no bona fide contest going on between the insurgent province and its former Sovereign . I said in my message of December last , It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood which alone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor . The same requirement must certainly be no less seriously considered when the graver issue of recognizing independence is in question , for no less positive test can be applied to the greater act than to the lesser while , on the other hand , the influences and consequences of the struggle upon the internal policy of the recognizing State , which form important factors when the recognition of belligerency is concerned , are secondary , if not rightly eliminable , factors when the real question is whether the community claiming recognition is or is not independent beyond peradventure . Nor from the standpoint of expediency do I think it would be wise or prudent for this Government to recognize at the present time the independence of the so called Cuban Republic . Such recognition is not necessary in order to enable the United States to intervene and pacify the island . To commit this country now to the recognition of any particular government in Cuba might subject us to embarrassing conditions of international obligation toward the organization so recognized . In case of intervention our conduct would be subject to the approval or disapproval of such government . We would be required to submit to its direction and to assume to it the mere relation of a friendly ally . When it shall appear hereafter that there is within the island a government capable of performing the duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation , and having , as a matter of fact , the proper forms and attributes of nationality , such government can be promptly and readily recognized and the relations and interests of the United States with such nation adjusted . There remain the alternative forms of intervention to end the war , either as an impartial neutral by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants , or as the active ally of the one party or the other . As to the first it is not to be forgotten that during the last few months the relations of the United States has virtually been one of friendly intervention in many ways , each not of itself conclusive , but all tending to the exertion of a potential influence toward an ultimate pacific result , just and honorable to all interests concerned . The spirit of all our acts hitherto has been an earnest , unselfish desire for peace and prosperity in Cuba , untarnished by differences between us and Spain , and unstained by the blood of American citizens . The forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war , according to the large dictates of humanity and following many historical precedents where neighboring States have interfered to check the hopeless sacrifices of life by internecine conflicts beyond their borders , is justifiable on rational grounds . It involves , however , hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement . The grounds for such intervention may be briefly summarized as , follows First . In the cause of humanity and to put an end to the barbarities , bloodshed , starvation , and horrible miseries now existing there , and which the parties to the conflict are either unable or unwilling to stop or mitigate . It is no answer to say this is all in another country , belonging to another nation , and is therefore none of our business . It is specially our duty , for it is right at our door . Second . We owe it to our citizens in Cuba to afford them that protection and indemnity for life and property which no government there can or will afford , and to that end to terminate the conditions that deprive them of legal protection . Third . The right to intervene may be justified by the very serious injury to the commerce , trade , and business of our people , and by the wanton destruction of property and devastation of the island . Fourth , and which is of the utmost importance . The present condition of affairs in Cuba is a constant menace to our peace , and entails upon this Government and enormous expense . With such a conflict waged for years in an island so near us and with which our people have such trade and business relations when the lives and liberty of our citizens are in constant danger and their property destroyed and themselves ruined where our trading vessels are liable to seizure and are seized at our very door by war ships of a foreign nation , the expeditions of filibustering that we are powerless to prevent altogether , and the irritating questions and entanglements thus arising all these and others that I need not mention , with the resulting strained relations , are constant menace to our peace , and compel us to keep on a semiwar footing with a nation with which we are at peace . These elements of danger and disorder already pointed out have been strikingly illustrated by a tragic event which has deeply and justly moved the American people . I have already transmitted to Congress the report of the naval court of inquiry on the destruction of the battle ship Maine in the harbor of Havana during the night of the 15th of February . The destruction of that noble vessel has filled the national heart with inexpressible horror . Tow hundred and fifty eight brave sailors and marines and two officers of our Navy , reposing in the fancied security of a friendly harbor , have been hurled to death , grief and want brought to their homes , and sorrow to the nation . The naval court of inquiry , which it is needless to say , commands the unqualified confidence of the Government , was unanimous in its conclusion that the destruction of the Maine was caused by an exterior explosion , that of a submarine mine . It did not assume to place the responsibility . That remains to be fixed . In any event the destruction of the Maine , by whatever exterior cause , is a patent and impressive proof of a state of things in Cuba that is intolerable . That condition is thus shown to be such that the Spanish Government can not assure safety and security to a vessel of the Americas Navy in the harbor of Havana on a mission of peace , and rightfully there . Further referring in this connection to recent diplomatic correspondence , a dispatch from our minister to Spain , of the 36th ultimo , contained the statement that the Spanish minister for foreign affairs assured him positively that the Spain will do all that the highest honor and justice require in the matter of the Maine . The reply above referred to of the 31st ultimo also contained an expression of the readiness of Spain to submit to an arbitration all the differences which can arise in this matter , which is subsequently explained by the note of the Spanish minister at Washington of the 10th instant , as follows As to the question of fact which springs from the diversity of views between the reports of the American and Spanish boards , Spain proposes that the facts be ascertained by an impartial investigation by experts , whose decision Spain accepts in advance . To this I have made no reply . President Grant , in 1875 , after discussing the phases of the contest as it then appeared , and its hopeless and apparent indefinite prolongation , said In such event , I am of opinion that other nations will be compelled to assume the responsibility which devolves upon them , and to seriously consider the only remaining measures possible mediation and intervention . Owing , perhaps , to the large expanse of water separating the island from the Peninsula , . . . the contending parties appear to have within themselves no depository of common confidence , to suggest wisdom when passion and excitement have their away , and to assume the part of peacemaker . In this view in the earlier days of the contest the good offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in good faith , without any selfish purpose , in the interest of humanity and in sincere friendship for both parties , but were at the time declined by Spain , with the declaration , nevertheless , that at a future time they would be indispensable . No intimation has been received that in the opinion of Spain that time has been reached . And yet the strife continues with all its dread horrors and all its injuries to the interests of the United States and of other nations . Each party seems quite capable of working great injury and damage to the other , as well as to all the relations and interests dependent on the existence of peace in the island but they seem incapable of reaching any adjustment , and both have thus far failed of achieving any success whereby one party shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other . Under these circumstances , the agency of others , either by mediation or intervention , seems to be the only alternative which must sooner or later be invoked for the termination of the strife . In the last annual message of my immediate predecessor , during the pending struggle , it was said when the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection has become manifest , and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence , and when a hopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife which means nothing more then the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict , a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations , which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge . In my annual message to Congress , December last , speaking to this question , I said The near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace , just alike to the Cubans and to Spain , as well as equitable to all our interests so intimately involved in the welfare of Cuba , is likely to be attained . If not , the exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken . When the time comes that action will be determined in the line of indisputable right and duty . It will be faced , without misgiving or hesitancy , in the light of the obligation this Government over to itself , to the people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and honor , and to humanity . Sure of the right , keeping free from all offense ourselves , actuated only by upright and patriotic considerations , moved neither by passion nor selfishness , the Government will continue its watchful care over the rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable and enduring . If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves , to civilization and humanity to intervene with force , it shall be without fault on our part only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the support and approval of the civilized world . The long trail has proved that the object for which Spain has waged the war can not be attained . The fire of insurrection may flame or may smolder with varying seasons , but it has not been and it is plain that it can not be extinguished by present methods . The only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the enforced pacification of Cuba . In the name of humanity , in the name of civilization , in behalf of endangered American interests which gives us the right and the duty to speak and to act , the war in Cuba must stop . In view of these facts and of these considerations , I ask the Congress to authorize and empower the President to take measure to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between the Government of Spain and the people of Cuba , and to secure in the island the establishment of a stable government , capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations , insuring peace and tranquility and the security of its citizens as well as our own , and to use the military and naval forces of the United States as may be necessary for these purposes . And in the interest of humanity and to aid in preserving the lives of the starving people of the island I recommend that the distribution of food and supplies be continued , and that an appropriation be made out of the public Treasury to supplement the charity of our citizens . The issue is now with the Congress . It is a solemn responsibility . I have exhausted every effort to relieve the intolerable condition of affairs which is at our doors . Prepared to execute every obligation imposed upon me by the Constitution and the law , I await your action . Yesterday , and since the preparation of the foregoing message , official information was received by me that the latest decree of the Queen Regent of Spain directs General Blanco , in order to prepare and facilitate peace , to proclaim a suspension of hostilities , the duration and details of which have not yet been communicated to me . This fact with every other pertinent consideration will , I am sure , have your just and careful attention in the solemn deliberations upon which you are about to enter . If this measure attains a successful result , then our aspirations as a Christian , peace loving people will be realized . If it fails , it will be only another justification for our contemplated action .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Whereas by a joint resolution passed by the Congress and approved April 20 , 1898 , and communicated to the Government of Spain , it was demanded that said Government at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters , and the President of the United States was directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the United States and to call into the actual service of the United States the militia of the several States to such extent as might be necessary to carry said resolution into effect and Whereas in carrying into effect said resolution the President of the United States deems it necessary to set on foot and maintain a blockade of the north coast of Cuba , including all ports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda , and the port of Cienfuegos , on the south coast of Cuba Now , therefore , William McKinley , President of the United States , in order to enforce the said resolution , do hereby declare and proclaim that the United States of America have instituted and will maintain a blockade of the north coast of Cuba , including ports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda , and the port of Cienfuegos , on the south coast of Cuba , aforesaid , in pursuance of the laws of the United States and the law of nations applicable to such cases . An efficient force will be posted so as to prevent the entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid . Any neutral vessel approaching any of said ports or attempting to leave the same without notice or knowledge of the establishment of such blockade will be duly warned by the commander of the blockading forces , who will indorse on her register the fact and the date of such warning , where such indorsement was made and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter any blockaded port she will be captured and sent to the nearest and convenient port for such proceedings against her and her cargo as prize as may be deemed advisable . Neutral vessels lying in any of said ports at the time of the establishment of such blockade will be allowed thirty days to issue therefrom . In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , this 22d day of April , D . , 1898 , and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty second . WILLIAM MCKINLEY By the President JOHN SHERMAN , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives At the outgoing of the old and the incoming of the new century you begin the last session of the Fifty sixth Congress with evidences on every hand of individual and national prosperity and with proof of the growing strength and increasing power for good of Republican institutions . Your countrymen will join with you in felicitation that American liberty is more firmly established than ever before , and that love for it and the determination to preserve it are more universal than at any former period of our history . The Republic was never so strong , because never so strongly entrenched in the hearts of the people as now . The Constitution , with few amendments , exists as it left the hands of its authors . The additions which have been made to it proclaim larger freedom and more extended citizenship . Popular government has demonstrated in its one hundred and twenty four years of trial here its stability and security , and its efficiency as the best instrument of national development and the best safeguard to human rights . When the Sixth Congress assembled in November , 1800 , the population of the United States was 5 , 308 , 483 . It is now 76 , 304 , 799 . Then we had sixteen States . Now we have forty five . Then our territory consisted Of 909 , 050 square miles . It is now 3 , 846 , 595 square miles . Education , religion , and morality have kept pace with our advancement in other directions , and while extending its power the Government has adhered to its foundation principles and abated none of them in dealing with our new peoples and possessions . A nation so preserved and blessed gives reverent thanks to God and invokes His guidance and the continuance of His care and favor . In our foreign intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment of the Chinese problem . Apart from this our relations with the powers have been happy . The recent troubles in China spring from the antiforeign agitation which for the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces . Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races and in the traditions of their Government . The Taiping rebellion and the opening of Chinese ports to foreign trade and settlement disturbed alike the homogeneity and the seclusion of China . Meanwhile foreign activity made itself felt in all quarters , not alone on the coast , but along the great river arteries and in the remoter districts , carrying new ideas and introducing new associations among a primitive people which had pursued for centuries a national policy of isolation . The telegraph and the railway spreading over their land , the steamers plying on their waterways , the merchant and the missionary penetrating year by year farther to the interior , became to the Chinese mind types of an alien invasion , changing the course of their national life and fraught with vague forebodings of disaster to their beliefs and their self control . For several years before the present troubles all the resources of foreign diplomacy , backed by moral demonstrations of the physical force of fleets and arms , have been needed to secure due respect for the treaty rights of foreigners and to obtain satisfaction from the responsible authorities for the sporadic outrages upon the persons and property of unoffending sojourners , which from time to time occurred at widely separated points in the northern provinces , as in the case of the outbreaks in Sze chuen and Shan tung . Posting of antiforeign placards became a daily occurrence , which the repeated reprobation of the Imperial power failed to check or punish . These inflammatory appeals to the ignorance and superstition of the masses , mendacious and absurd in their accusations and deeply hostile in their spirit , could not but work cumulative harm . They aimed at no particular class of foreigners they were impartial in attacking everything foreign . An outbreak in Shan tung , in which German missionaries were slain , was the too natural result of these malevolent teachings . The posting of seditious placards , exhorting to the utter destruction of foreigners and of every foreign thing , continued unrebuked . Hostile demonstrations toward the stranger gained strength by organization . The sect , commonly styled the Boxers , developed greatly in the provinces north of the Yang Tse , and with the collusion of many notable officials , including some in the immediate councils of the Throne itself , became alarmingly aggressive . No foreigner s life , outside of the protected treaty ports , was safe . No foreign interest was secure from spoliation . The diplomatic representatives of the powers in Peking strove in vain to check this movement . Protest was followed by demand and demand by renewed protest , to be met with perfunctory edicts from the Palace and evasive and futile assurances from the Tsung li Yamen . The circle of the Boxer influence narrowed about Peking , and while nominally stigmatized as seditious , it was felt that its spirit pervaded the capital itself , that the Imperial forces were imbued with its doctrines , and that the immediate counselors of the Empress Dowager were in full sympathy with the antiforeign movement . The increasing gravity of the conditions in China and the imminence of peril to our own diversified interests in the Empire , as well as to those of all the other treaty governments , were soon appreciated by this Government , causing it profound solicitude . The United States from the earliest days of foreign intercourse with China had followed a policy of peace , omitting no occasions to testify good will , to further the extension of lawful trade , to respect the sovereignty of its Government , and to insure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest means the fullest measure of protection for the lives and property of our law abiding citizens and for the exercise of their beneficent callings among the Chinese people . Mindful of this , it was felt to be appropriate that our purposes should be pronounced in favor of such course as would hasten united action of the powers at Peking to promote the administrative reforms so greatly needed for strengthening the Imperial Government and maintaining the integrity of China , in which we believed the whole western world to be alike concerned . To these ends I caused to be addressed to the several powers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of influence in China the circular proposals of 1899 , inviting from them declarations of their intentions and views as to the desirability of the adoption of measures insuring the benefits of equality of treatment of all foreign trade throughout China . With gratifying unanimity the responses coincided in this common policy , enabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiations proof of the friendly spirit which animates the various powers interested in the untrammeled development of commerce and industry in the Chinese Empire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial world . In this conclusion , which I had the gratification to announce as a completed engagement to the interested powers on March 20 , 1900 , I hopefully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust of foreign purposes which for a year past had appeared to inspire the policy of the Imperial Government , and for the effective exertion by it of power and authority to quell the critical antiforeign movement in the northern provinces most immediately influenced by the Manchu sentiment . Seeking to testify confidence in the willingness and ability of the Imperial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils we suffered and feared , the marine guard , which had been sent to Peking in the autumn of 1899 for the protection of the legation , was withdrawn at the earliest practicable moment , and all pending questions were remitted , as far as we were concerned , to the ordinary resorts of diplomatic intercourse . The Chinese Government proved , however , unable to check the rising strength of the Boxers and appeared to be a prey to internal dissensions . In the unequal contest the antiforeign influences soon gained the ascendancy under the leadership of Prince Tuan . Organized armies of Boxers , with which the Imperial forces affiliated , held the country between Peking and the coast , penetrated into Manchuria up to the Russian borders , and through their emissaries threatened a like rising throughout northern China . Attacks upon foreigners , destruction of their property , and slaughter of native converts were reported from all sides . The Tsung li Yamen , already permeated with hostile sympathies , could make no effective response to the appeals of the legations . At this critical juncture , in the early spring of this year , a proposal was made by the other powers that a combined fleet should be assembled in Chinese waters as a moral demonstration , under cover of which to exact of the Chinese Government respect for foreign treaty rights and the suppression of the Boxers . The United States , while not participating in the joint demonstration , promptly sent from the Philippines all ships that could be spared for service on the Chinese coast . A small force of marines was landed at Taku and sent to Peking for the protection of the American legation . Other powers took similar action , until some four hundred men were assembled in the capital as legation guards . Still the peril increased . The legations reported the development of the seditious movement in Peking and the need of increased provision for defense against it . While preparations were in progress for a larger expedition , to strengthen the legation guards and keep the railway open , an attempt of the foreign ships to make a landing at Taku was met by a fire from the Chinese forts . The forts were thereupon shelled by the foreign vessels , the American admiral taking no part in the attack , on the ground that we were not at war with China and that a hostile demonstration might consolidate the antiforeign elements and strengthen the Boxers to oppose the relieving column . Two days later the Taku forts were captured after a sanguinary conflict . Severance of communication with Peking followed , and a combined force of additional guards , which was advancing to Peking by the Pei Ho , was checked at Langfang . The isolation of the legations was complete . The siege and the relief of the legations has passed into undying history . In all the stirring chapter which records the heroism of the devoted band , clinging to hope in the face of despair , and the undaunted spirit that led their relievers through battle and suffering to the goal , it is a memory of which my countrymen may be justly proud that the honor of our flag was maintained alike in the siege and the rescue , and that stout American hearts have again set high , in fervent emulation with true men of other race and language , the indomitable courage that ever strives for the cause of right and justice . By June 19 the legations were cut off . An identical note from the , Yamen ordered each minister to leave Peking , under a promised escort , within twenty four hours . To gain time they replied , asking prolongation of the time , which was afterwards granted , and requesting an interview with the Tsung li Yamen on the following day . No reply being received , on the morning of the 2oth the German minister , Baron von Ketteler , set out for the Yamen to obtain a response , and oil the way was murdered . An attempt by the legation guard to recover his body was foiled by the Chinese . Armed forces turned out against the legations . Their quarters were surrounded and attacked . The mission compounds were abandoned , their inmates taking refuge in the British legation , where all the other legations and guards gathered for more effective defense . Four hundred persons were crowded in its narrow compass . Two thousand native converts were assembled in a nearby palace under protection of the foreigners . Lines of defense were strengthened , trenches dug , barricades raised , and preparations made to stand a siege , which at once began . From June 20 until July 17 , writes Minister Conger , 11 there was scarcely an hour during which there was not firing upon some part of our lines and into some of the legations , varying from a single shot to a general and continuous attack along the whole line . Artillery was placed around the legations and on the over looking palace walls , and thousands Of 3 inch shot and shell were fired , destroying some buildings and damaging all . So thickly did the balls rain , that , when the ammunition of the besieged ran low , five quarts of Chinese bullets were gathered in an hour in one compound and recast . Attempts were made to burn the legations by setting neighboring houses on fire , but the flames were successfully fought off , although the Austrian , Belgian , Italian . and Dutch legations were then and subsequently burned . With the aid of the native converts , directed by the missionaries , to whose helpful co operation Conger awards unstinted praise , the British legation was made a veritable fortress . The British minister , Sir Claude MacDonald , was chosen general commander of the defense , with the secretary of the American legation , Squiers , as chief of staff . To save life and ammunition the besieged sparingly returned the incessant fire of the Chinese soldiery , fighting only to repel attack or make an occasional successful sortie for strategic advantage , such as that of fifty five American , British , and Russian marines led by Captain Myers , of the United States Marine Corps , which resulted in the capture of a formidable barricade on the wall that gravely menaced the American position . It was held to the last , and proved an invaluable acquisition , because commanding the water gate through which the relief column entered . During the siege the defenders lost 65 killed , 135 wounded , and 7 by disease , the last all children . On July 14 the besieged bad their first communication with the Tsung li Yamen , from whom a message came inviting to a conference , which was declined . Correspondence , however , ensued and a sort of armistice was agreed upon , which stopped the bombardment and lessened the rifle fire for a time . Even then no protection whatever was afforded , nor any aid given , save to send to the legations a small supply of fruit and three sacks of flour . Indeed , the only communication had with the Chinese Government related to the occasional delivery or dispatch of a telegram or to the demands of the Tsung li Yamen for the withdrawal of the legations to the coast under escort . Not only are the protestations of the Chinese Government that it protected and succored the legations positively contradicted , but irresistible proof accumulates that the attacks upon them were made by Imperial troops , regularly uniformed , armed , and officered , belonging to the command of Jung Lu , the Imperial commander in chief . Decrees encouraging the Boxers , organizing them tinder prominent Imperial officers , provisioning them , and even granting them large sums in the name of the Empress Dowager , are known to exist . Members of the Tsung li Yamen who counseled protection of the foreigners were beheaded . Even in the distant provinces men suspected of foreign sympathy were put to death , prominent among these being Chang Yen hoon , formerly Chinese minister in Washington . With the negotiation of the partial armistice of July 14 , a proceeding which was doubtless promoted by the representations of the Chinese envoy in Washington , the way was opened for the conveyance to Conger of a test message sent by the Secretary of State through the kind offices of Minister Wu Ting fang . Conger s reply , dispatched from Peking on July 18 through the same channel , afforded to the outside world the first tidings that the inmates of the legations were still alive and hoping for succor . This news stimulated the preparations for a joint relief expedition in numbers sufficient to overcome the resistance which for a month had been organizing between Taku and the capital . Reinforcements sent by all the co operating Governments were constantly arriving . The United States contingent , hastily assembled from the Philippines or dispatched from this country , amounted to some 5 , 000 men , under the able command first of the lamented Colonel Liscurn and afterwards of General Chaffee . Toward the end of July the movement began . A severe conflict followed at Tientsin , in which Colonel Liscurn was killed . The city was stormed and partly destroyed . Its capture afforded the base of operations from which to make the final advance , which began in the first days of August , the expedition being made up of Japanese , Russian , British , and American troops at the outset . Another battle was fought and won at Yangtsun . Thereafter the disheartened Chinese troops offered little show of resistance . A few days later the important position of Ho si woo was taken . A rapid march brought the united forces to the populous city of Tung Chow , which capitulated without a contest . On August 14 the capital was reached . After a brief conflict beneath the walls the relief column entered and the legations were saved . The United States soldiers , sailors , and marines , officers and men alike , in those distant climes and unusual surroundings , showed the same valor , discipline , and good conduct and gave proof of the same high degree of intelligence and efficiency which have distinguished them in every emergency . The Imperial family and the Government had fled a few days before . The city was without visible control . The remaining Imperial soldiery had made on the night of the 13th a last attempt to exterminate the besieged , which was gallantly repelled . It fell to the occupying forces to restore order and organize a provisional administration . Happily the acute disturbances were confined to the northern provinces . It is a relief to recall and a pleasure to record the loyal conduct of the viceroys and local authorities of the southern and eastern provinces . Their efforts were continuously directed to the pacific control of the vast populations under their rule and to the scrupulous observance of foreign treaty rights . At critical moments they did not hesitate to memorialize the Throne , urging the protection of the legations , the restoration of communication , and the assertion of the Imperial authority against the subversive elements . They maintained excellent relations with the official representatives of foreign powers . To their kindly disposition is largely due the success of the consuls in removing many of the missionaries from the interior to places of safety . In this relation the action of the consuls should be highly commended . In Shan tung and eastern Chi li the task was difficult , but , thanks to their energy and the cooperation of American and foreign naval commanders , hundreds of foreigners , including those of other nationalities than ours , were rescued from imminent peril . The policy of the United States through all this trying period was clearly announced and scrupulously carried out . A circular note to the powers dated July 3 proclaimed our attitude . Treating the condition in the north as one of virtual anarchy , in which the great provinces of the south and southeast had no share , we regarded the local authorities in the latter quarters as representing the Chinese people with whom we sought to remain in peace and friendship . Our declared aims involved no war against the Chinese nation . We adhered to the legitimate office of rescuing the imperiled legation , obtaining redress for wrongs already suffered , securing wherever possible the safety of American life and property in China , and preventing a spread of the disorders or their recurrence . As was then said , The policy of the Government of the United States is to seek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China , preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity , protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law , and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire . Faithful to those professions which , as it proved , reflected the views and purposes of the other co operating Governments , all our efforts have been directed toward ending the anomalous situation in China by negotiations for a settlement at the earliest possible moment . As soon as the sacred duty of relieving our legation and its dependents was accomplished we withdrew from active hostilities , leaving our legation under an adequate guard in Peking as a channel of negotiation and settlement a course adopted by others of the interested powers . Overtures of the empowered representatives of the Chinese Emperor have been considerately entertained . The Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the Imperial power in Peking has been accepted as in full consonance with our own desires , for we have held and hold that effective reparation for wrongs suffered and an enduring settlement that will make their recurrence impossible can best be brought about under an authority which the Chinese nation reverences and obeys . While so doing we forego no jot of our undoubted right to exact exemplary and deterrent punishment of the responsible authors and abettors of the criminal acts whereby we and other nations have suffered grievous injury . For the real culprits , the evil counselors who have misled the Imperial judgment and diverted the sovereign authority to their own guilty ends , , full expiation becomes imperative within the rational limits of retributive Justice . Regarding this as the initial condition of an acceptable settlement between China and the powers , I said in my message of October 18 to the Chinese Emperor I trust that negotiations may begin so soon as we and the other offended Governments shall be effectively satisfied of Your Majesty s ability and power to treat with just sternness the principal offenders , who are doubly culpable , not alone toward the foreigners , but toward Your Majesty , under whose rule the purpose of China to dwell in concord with the world had hitherto found expression in the welcome and protection assured to strangers . Taking , as a point of departure , the Imperial edict appointing Earl Li Hung Chang and Prince Ching plenipotentiaries to arrange a settlement , and the edict of September 25 , whereby certain high officials were designated for punishment , this Government has moved , in concert with the other powers , toward the opening of negotiations , which Conger , assisted by Rockhill , has been authorized to conduct on behalf of the United States . General bases of negotiation formulated by the Government of the French Republic have been accepted with certain reservations as to details , made necessary by our own circumstances , but , like similar reservations by other powers , open to discussion in the progress of the negotiations . The disposition of the Emperor s Government to admit liability for wrongs done to foreign Governments and their nationals , and to act upon such additional designation of the guilty persons as the foreign ministers at Peking may be in a position to make , gives hope of a complete settlement of all questions involved , assuring foreign rights of residence and intercourse on terms of equality for all the world . I regard as one of the essential factors of a durable adjustment the securement of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith , since insecurity of those natives who may embrace alien creeds is a scarcely less effectual assault upon the rights of foreign worship and teaching than would be the direct invasion thereof . The matter of indemnity for our wronged citizens is a question of grave concern . Measured in money alone , a sufficient reparation may prove to be beyond the ability of China to meet . All the powers concur in emphatic disclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement through the dismemberment of the Empire . I am disposed to think that due compensation may be made in part by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights and immunities , and , most important of all , by the opening of China to the equal commerce of all the world . These views have been and will be earnestly advocated by our representatives . The Government of Russia has put forward a suggestion , that in the event of protracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities the matter may be relegated to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague . I favorably incline to this , believing that high tribunal could not fail to reach a solution no less conducive to the stability and enlarged prosperity of China itself than immediately beneficial to the powers . Ratifications of a treaty of extradition with the Argentine Republic were exchanged on June 2 last . While the Austro Hungarian Government has in the many cases that have been reported of the arrest of our naturalized citizens for alleged evasion of military service faithfully observed the provisions of the treaty and released such persons from military obligations , it has in some instances expelled those whose presence in the community of their origin was asserted to have a pernicious influence . Representations have been made against this course whenever its adoption has appeared unduly onerous . We have been urgently solicited by Belgium to ratify the International Convention of June , 1899 , amendatory of the previous Convention of 1890 in respect to the regulation of the liquor trade in Africa . Compliance was necessarily withheld , in the absence of the advice and consent of the Senate thereto . The principle involved has the cordial sympathy of this Government , which in the reversionary negotiations advocated more drastic measures , and I would gladly see its extension , by international agreement , to the restriction of the liquor traffic with all . uncivilized peoples , especially in the Western Pacific . A conference will be held at Brussels December 11 , 1900 , under the Convention for the protection of industrial property , concluded at Paris March 20 , 1883 , to which delegates from this country have been appointed . Any lessening of the difficulties that our inventors encounter in obtaining patents abroad for their inventions and that our farmers , manufacturers , and merchants may have in the protection of their trade marks is worthy of careful consideration , and your attention will be called to the results of the conference at the proper time . In the interest of expanding trade between this country and South America , efforts have been made during the past year to conclude conventions with the southern republics for the enlargement of postal facilities . Two such agreements , signed with Bolivia on April 24 , of which that establishing the money order system is undergoing certain changes suggested by the Post Office Department , have not yet been ratified by this Government . A treaty of extradition with that country , signed on the same day , is before the Senate . A boundary dispute between Brazil and Bolivia over the territory of Acre is in a fair way of friendly adjustment , a protocol signed in December , 1899 , having agreed on a definite frontier and provided for its demarcation by a joint commission . Conditions in Brazil have weighed heavily on our export trade to that country in marked contrast to the favorable conditions upon which Brazilian products are admitted into our markets . Urgent representations have been made to that Government on the subject and some amelioration has been effected . We rely upon the reciprocal justice and good will of that Government to assure to us a further improvement in our commercial relations . The Convention signed May 24 , 1897 , for the final settlement of claims left in abeyance upon the dissolution of the Commission of 1893 , was at length ratified by the Chilean Congress and the supplemental Commission has been organized . It remains for the Congress to appropriate for the necessary expenses of the Commission . The insurrectionary movement which disturbed Colombia in the latter part of 1899 has been practically suppressed , although guerrillas still operate in some departments . The executive power of that Republic changed hands in August last by the act of Vice President Marroquin in assuming the reins of government during the absence of President San Clemente from the capital . The change met with no serious opposition , and , following the precedents in such cases , the United States minister entered into relations with the new defacto Government on September 17 . It is gratifying to announce that the residual questions between Costa Rica and Nicaragua growing out of the Award of President Cleveland in 1888 have been adjusted through the choice of an American engineer , General Alexander , as umpire to run the disputed line . His task has been accomplished to the satisfaction of both contestants . A revolution in the Dominican Republic toward the close of last year resulted in the installation of President Jimenez , whose Government was formally recognized in January . Since then final payment has been made of the American claim in regard to the Ozama bridge . The year of the exposition has been fruitful in occasions for displaying the good will that exists between this country and France . This great competition brought together from every nation the best in natural productions , industry , science , and the arts , submitted in generous rivalry to a judgment made all the more searching because of that rivalry . The extraordinary increase of exportations from this country during the past three years and the activity with which our inventions and wares bad invaded new markets caused much interest to center upon the American exhibit , and every encouragement was offered in the way of space and facilities to permit of its being comprehensive as a whole and complete in every part . It was , however , not an easy task to assemble exhibits that could fitly illustrate our diversified resources and manufactures . Singularly enough , our national prosperity lessened . the incentive to exhibit . The dealer in raw materials knew that the user must come to him the great factories were contented with the phenomenal demand for their output , not alone at home , but also abroad , where merit had already won a profitable trade . Appeals had to be made to the patriotism of exhibitors to induce them to incur outlays promising no immediate return . This was especially the case where it became needful to complete an industrial sequence or illustrate a class of processes . One manufacturer after another had to be visited and importuned , and at times , after a promise to exhibit in a particular section bad been obtained , it would be withdrawn , owing to pressure of trade orders , and a new quest would have to be made . The installation of exhibits , too , encountered many obstacles and involved unexpected cost . The exposition was far from ready at the date fixed for its opening . The French transportation lines were congested with offered freight . Belated goods had to be hastily installed in unfinished quarters with whatever labor could be obtained in the prevailing confusion . Nor was the task of the Commission lightened by the fact that , owing to the scheme of classification adopted , it was impossible to have the entire exhibit of any one country in the same building or more than one group of exhibits in the same part of any building . Our installations were scattered on both sides of the Seine and in widely remote suburbs of Paris , so that additional assistants were needed for the work of supervision and arrangement . Despite all these drawbacks the contribution of the United States was not only the largest foreign display , but was among the earliest in place and the most orderly in arrangement . Our exhibits were shown in one hundred and one out of one hundred and twenty one classes , and more completely covered the entire classification than those of any other nation . In total number they ranked next after those of France , and the attractive form in which they were presented secured general attention . A criterion of the extent and success of our participation and of the thoroughness with which our exhibits were organized is seen in the awards granted to American exhibitors by the international jury , namely , grand prizes , 240 gold medals , 597 silver medals , 776 bronze medals , 541 , and honorable mentions , 322 2 , 476 in all , being the greatest total number given to the exhibit of any exhibiting nation , as well as the largest number in each grade . This significant recognition of merit in competition with the chosen exhibits of all other nations and at the hands of juries almost wholly made tip of representatives of France and other competing countries is not only most gratifying , but is especially valuable , since it sets us to the front in international questions of supply and demand , while the large proportion of awards in the classes of art and artistic manufactures afforded unexpected proof of the stimulation of national culture by the prosperity that flows from natural productiveness joined to industrial excellence . Apart from the exposition several occasions for showing international good will occurred . The inauguration in Paris of the Lafayette Monument , presented by the school children of the United States , and the designing of a commemorative coin by our Mint and the presentation of the first piece struck to the President of the Republic , were marked by appropriate ceremonies , and the Fourth of July was especially observed in the French capital . Good will prevails in our relations with the German Empire . An amicable adjustment of the long pending question of the admission of our life insurance companies to do business in Prussia has been reached . One of the principal companies has already been readmitted and the way is opened for the others to share the privilege . The settlement of the Samoan problem , to which I adverted in my last message , has accomplished good results . Peace and contentment prevail in the islands , especially in Tutuila , where a convenient administration that has won the confidence and esteem of the kindly disposed natives has been organized under the direction of the commander of the United States naval station at Pago Pago . An Imperial meat inspection law has been enacted for Germany . While it may simplify the inspections , it prohibits certain products heretofore admitted . There is still great uncertainty as to whether our well nigh extinguished German trade in meat products can revive tinder its new burdens . Much will depend upon regulations not yet promulgated , which we confidently hope will be free from the discriminations which attended the enforcement of the old statutes . The remaining link in the new lines of direct telegraphic communication between the United States and the German Empire has recently been completed , affording a gratifying occasion for exchange of friendly congratulations with the German Emperor . Our friendly relations with Great Britain continue . The war in Southern Africa introduced important questions . A condition unusual in international wars was presented in that while one belligerent had control of the seas , the other had no ports , shipping , or direct trade , but was only accessible through the territory of a neutral . Vexatious questions arose through Great Britain s action in respect to neutral cargoes , not contraband in their own nature , shipped to Portuguese South Africa , on the score of probable or suspected ultimate destination to the Boer States . Such consignments in British ships , by which alone direct trade is kept up between our ports and Southern Africa , were seized in application of a municipal law prohibiting British vessels from trading with the enemy without regard to any contraband character of the goods , while cargoes shipped to Delagoa Bay in neutral bottoms were arrested on the ground of alleged destination to enemy s country . Appropriate representations on our part resulted in the British Government agreeing to purchase outright all such goods shown to be the actual property of American citizens , thus closing the incident to the satisfaction of the immediately interested parties , although , unfortunately , without a broad settlement of the question of a neutral s right to send goods not contraband per se to a neutral port adjacent to a belligerent area . The work of marking certain provisional boundary points , for convenience of administration , around the head of Lynn Canal , in accordance with the temporary arrangement of October , 1899 , Was completed by a joint survey in July last . The modus vivendi has so far worked without friction , and the Dominion Government has provided rules and regulations for securing to our citizens the benefit of the reciprocal stipulation that the citizens or subjects of either power found by that arrangement within the temporary jurisdiction of the other shall suffer no diminution of the rights and privileges they have hitherto enjoyed . But however necessary such an expedient may have been to tide over the grave emergencies of the situation , it is at best but an unsatisfactory makeshift , which should not be suffered to delay the speedy and complete establishment of the frontier line to which we are entitled under the Russo American treaty for the cession of Alaska . In this relation I may refer again to the need of definitely marking the Alaskan boundary where it follows the one hundred and forty first meridian . A convention to that end has been before the Senate for some two years , but as no action has been taken I contemplate negotiating a new convention for a joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic observations . These , it is believed , will give more accurate and unquestionable results than the sidereal methods heretofore independently followed , which , as is known , proved discrepant at several points on the line , although not varying at any place more than 700 feet The pending claim of May against the Guatemalan Government has been settled by arbitration , George Jenner , British minister at Guatemala , who was chosen as sole arbitrator . having awarded 143 , 750 . 73 in gold to the claimant . Various American claims against Haiti have been or are being advanced to the resort of arbitration . As the result of negotiations with the Government of Honduras in regard to the indemnity demanded for the murder of Frank Pears in Honduras , that Government has paid 10 , 000 in settlement of the claim of the heirs . The assassination of King Humbert called forth sincere expressions of sorrow from this Government and people , and occasion was fitly taken to testify to the Italian nation the high regard here felt for the memory of the lamented ruler . In my last message I referred at considerable length to the lynching of five Italians at Tallulah . Notwithstanding the efforts of the Federal Government , the production of evidence tending to inculpate the authors of this grievous offense against our civilization , and the repeated inquests set on foot by the authorities of the State of Louisiana , no punishments have followed . Successive grand juries have failed to indict . The representations of the Italian Government in the face of this miscarriage have been most temperate and just . Setting the principle at issue high above all consideration of merely pecuniary indemnification , such as this Government made in the three previous cases , Italy has solemnly invoked the pledges of existing treaty and asked that the justice to which she is entitled shall be meted in regard to her unfortunate countrymen in our territory with the same full measure she herself would give to any American were his reciprocal treaty rights contemned . I renew the urgent recommendations I made last year that the Congress appropriately confer upon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class of international cases where the ultimate responsibility of the Federal Government may be involved , and I invite action upon the bills to accomplish this which were introduced in the Sen . ate and House . It is incumbent upon us to remedy the statutory omission which has led , and may again lead , to such untoward results . I have pointed out the necessity and the precedent for legislation of this character . Its enactment is a simple measure of previsory justice toward the nations with which we as a sovereign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal observance . While the Italian Government naturally regards such action as the primary and , indeed , the most essential element in the disposal of the Tallulah incident , I advise that , in accordance with precedent , and in view of the improbability of that particular case being reached by the bill now pending , Congress make gracious provision for indemnity to the Italian sufferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore . In my inaugural address I referred to the general subject of lynching in these words Lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States courts , not mobs , must execute the penalties of the law . The preservation of public order , the right of discussion , the integrity of courts , and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our Government securely rests . This I most urgently reiterate and again invite the attention of my countrymen to this reproach upon our civilization . The closing year has witnessed a decided strengthening of Japan s relations to other states . The development of her independent judicial and administrative functions under the treaties which took effect July 17 , 1899 , has proceeded without international friction , showing the competence of the Japanese to hold a foremost place among modern peoples . In the treatment of the difficult Chinese problems Japan has acted in harmonious concert with the other powers , and her generous cooperation materially aided in the joint relief of the beleaguered legations in Peking and in bringing about an understanding preliminary to a settlement of the issues between the powers and China . Japan s declarations in favor of the integrity of the Chinese Empire and the conservation of open world trade therewith have been frank and positive . As a factor for promoting the general interests of peace , order , and fair commerce in the Far East the influence of Japan can hardly be overestimated . The valuable aid and kindly courtesies extended by the Japanese Government and naval officers to the battle ship Oregon are gratefully appreciated . Complaint was made last summer of the discriminatory enforcement of a bubonic quarantine against Japanese on the Pacific coast and of interference with their travel in California and Colorado under the health laws of those States . The latter restrictions have been adjudged by a Federal court to be unconstitutional . No recurrence of either cause of complaint is apprehended . No noteworthy incident has occurred in our relations with our important southern neighbor . Commercial intercourse with Mexico continues to thrive , and the two Governments neglect no opportunity to foster their mutual interests in all practicable ways . Pursuant to the declaration of the Supreme Court that the awards of the late joint Commission in the La Abra and Weil claims were obtained through fraud , the sum awarded in the first case , 403 , 030 . 08 , has been returned to Mexico , and the amount of the Weil award will be returned in like manner . A Convention indefinitely extending the time for the labors of the United States and Mexican International Water Boundary Commission has been signed . It is with satisfaction that I am able to announce the formal notification at The Hague , on September 4 , of the deposit of ratifications of the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes by sixteen powers , namely , the United States , Austria , Belgium , Denmark , England , France , Germany , Italy , Persia , Portugal , Roumania , Russia , Siam , Spain , Sweden and Norway , and the Netherlands . Japan also has since ratified the Convention . The Administrative Council of the Permanent Court of Arbitration has been organized and has adopted rules of order and a constitution for the International Arbitration Bureau . In accordance with Article XXIII of the Convention providing for the appointment by each signatory power of persons of known competency in questions of international law as arbitrators , I have appointed as members of this Court , Benjamin Harrison , of Indiana , ex President of the United States Melville Fuller , of Illinois , Chief justice of the United States John Griggs , of New Jersey , Attorney General of the United States and George Gray , of Delaware , a judge of the circuit court of the United States . As an incident of the brief revolution in the Mosquito district of Nicaragua early in 1899 the insurgents forcibly collected from American merchants duties upon imports . On the restoration of order the Nicaraguan authorities demanded a second payment of such duties on the ground that they were due to the titular Government and that their diversion had aided the revolt . This position was not accepted by us . After prolonged discussion a compromise was effected under which the amount of the second payments was deposited with the British consul at San Juan del Norte in trust until the two Governments should determine whether the first payments had been made under compulsion to a de facto authority . Agreement as to this was not reached , and the point was waived by the act of the Nicaraguan Government in requesting the British consul to return the deposits to the merchants . Menacing differences between several of the Central American States have been accommodated , our ministers rendering good offices toward an understanding . The all important matter of an interoceanic canal has assumed a new phase . Adhering to its refusal to reopen the question of the forfeiture of the contract of the Maritime Canal Company , which was terminated for alleged nonexecution in October , 1899 , the Government of Nicaragua has since supplemented that action by declaring the so styled Eyre Cragin option void for nonpayment of the stipulated advance . Protests in relation to these acts have been filed in the State Department and are under consideration . Deeming itself relieved from existing engagements , the Nicaraguan Government shows a disposition to deal freely with the canal question either in the way of negotiations with the United States or by taking measures to promote the waterway . Overtures for a convention to effect the building of a canal under the auspices of the United States are under consideration . In the meantime , the views of the Congress upon the general subject , in the light of the report of the Commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of the various trans Isthmian ship canal projects , may be awaited . I commend to the early attention of the Senate the Convention with Great Britain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and to remove any objection which might arise out of the Convention commonly called the Clayton Bulwer Treaty . The long standing contention with Portugal , growing out of the seizure of the Delagoa Bay Railway , has been at last determined by a favorable award of the tribunal of arbitration at Berne , to which it was submitted . The amount of the award , which was deposited in London awaiting arrangements by the Governments of the United States and Great Britain for its disposal , has recently been paid over to the two Governments . A lately signed Convention of Extradition with Peru as amended by the Senate has been ratified by the Peruvian Congress . Another illustration of the policy of this Government to refer international disputes to impartial arbitration is seen in the agreement reached with Russia to submit the claims on behalf of American sealing vessels seized in Bering Sea to determination by Asser , a distinguished statesman and jurist of the Netherlands . Thanks are due to the Imperial Russian Government for the kindly aid rendered by its authorities in eastern Siberia to American missionaries fleeing from Manchuria . Satisfactory progress has been made toward the conclusion of a general treaty of friendship and intercourse with Spain , in replacement of the old treaty , which passed into abeyance by reason of the late war . A new convention of extradition is approaching completion , and I should be much pleased were a commercial arrangement to follow . I feel that we should not suffer to pass any opportunity to reaffirm the cordial ties that existed between us and Spain from the time of our earliest independence , and to enhance the mutual benefits of that commercial intercourse which is natural between the two countries . By the terms of the Treaty of Peace the line bounding the ceded Philippine group in the southwest failed to include several small islands lying westward of the Sulus , which have always been recognized as under Spanish control . The occupation of Sibutd and Cagayan Sulu by our naval forces elicited a claim on the part of Spain , the essential equity of which could not be gainsaid . In order to cure the defect of the treaty by removing all possible ground of future misunderstanding respecting the interpretation of its third article , I directed the negotiation of a supplementary treaty , which will be forthwith laid before the Senate , whereby Spain quits all title and claim of title to the islands named as well as to any and all islands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago lying outside the lines described in said third article , and agrees that all such islands shall be comprehended in the cession of the archipelago as fully as if they had been expressly included within those lines . In consideration of this cession the United States is to pay to Spain the sum of 100 , 000 . A bill is now pending to effect the recommendation made in my last annual message that appropriate legislation be had to carry into execution Article VII of the Treaty of Peace with Spain , by which the United States assumed the payment of certain claims for indemnity of its citizens against Spain . I ask that action be taken to fulfill this obligation . The King of Sweden and Norway has accepted the joint invitation of the United States , Germany , and Great Britain to arbitrate claims growing out of losses sustained in the Samoan Islands in the course of military operations made necessary by the disturbances in 1899 . Our claims upon the Government of the Sultan for reparation for injuries suffered by American citizens in Armenia and elsewhere give promise of early and satisfactory settlement . His Majesty s good disposition in this regard has been evinced by the issuance of an irade for rebuilding the American college at Harpoot . The failure of action by the Senate at its last session upon the commercial conventions then submitted for its consideration and approval , although caused by the great pressure of other legislative business , has caused much disappointment to the agricultural and industrial interests of the country , which hoped to profit by their provisions . The conventional periods for their ratification having expired , it became necessary to sign additional articles extending the time for that purpose . This was requested on our part , and the other Governments interested have concurred with the exception of one convention , in respect to which no formal reply has been received . Since my last communication to the Congress on this subject special commercial agreements under the third section of the tariff act have been proclaimed with Portugal , with Italy , and with Germany . Commercial conventions tinder the general limitations of the fourth section of the same act have been concluded with Nicaragua , with Ecuador , with the Dominican Republic , with Great Britain on behalf of the island of Trinidad , and with Denmark on behalf of the island of Croix . These will be early communicated to the Senate . Negotiations with other Governments are in progress for the improvement and security of our commercial relations . The policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the principles of international equity and has been so repeatedly approved by the people of the United States that there ought to be no hesitation in either branch of the Congress in giving to it full effect . This Government desires to preserve the most just and amicable commercial relations with all foreign countries , unmoved by the industrial rivalries necessarily developed in the expansion of international trade . It is believed that the foreign Governments generally entertain the same purpose , although in some instances there are clamorous demands upon them for legislation specifically hostile to American interests . Should these demands prevail I shall communicate with the Congress with the view of advising such legislation as may be necessary to meet the emergency . The exposition of the resources and products of the Western Hemisphere to be held at Buffalo next year promises important results not only for the United States but for the other participating countries . It is gratifying that the Latin American States have evinced the liveliest interest , and the fact that an International American Congress will be held in the City of Mexico while the exposition is in progress encourages the hope of a larger display at Buffalo than might otherwise be practicable . The work of preparing an exhibit of our national resources is making satisfactory progress under the direction of different officials of the Federal Government , and the various States of the Union have shown a disposition toward the most liberal participation in the enterprise . The Bureau of the American Republics continues to discharge , with the happiest results , the important work of promoting cordial relations between the United States and the Latin American countries , all of which are now active members of the International Union . The Bureau has been instrumental in bringing about the agreement for another International American Congress , which is to meet in the City of Mexico in October , 1901 . The Bureau s future for another term of ten years is assured by the international compact , but the congress will doubtless have much to do with shaping new lines of work and a general policy . Its usefulness to the interests of Latin American trade is widely appreciated and shows a gratifying development . The practical utility of the consular service in obtaining a wide range of information as to the industries and commerce of other countries and the opportunities thereby afforded for introducing the sale of our goods have kept steadily in advance of the notable expansion of our foreign trade , and abundant evidence has been furnished , both at home and abroad , of the fact that the Consular Reports , including many from our diplomatic representatives , have to a considerable extent pointed out ways and means of disposing of a great variety of manufactured goods which otherwise might not have found sale abroad . Testimony of foreign observers to the commercial efficiency of the consular corps seems to be conclusive , and our own manufacturers and exporters highly appreciate the value of the services rendered not only in the printed reports but also in the individual efforts of consular officers to promote American trade . An increasing part of the work of the Bureau of Foreign Commerce , whose primary duty it is to compile and print the reports , is to answer inquiries from trade organizations , business houses , etc . , as to conditions in various parts of the world , and , notwithstanding the smallness of the force employed , the work has been so systematized that responses are made with such promptitude and accuracy as to elicit flattering encomiums . The experiment of printing the Consular Reports daily for immediate use by trade bodies , exporters , and the press , which was begun in January , 1898 , continues to give general satisfaction . It is gratifying to be able to state that the surplus revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1900 , were 79 , 527 , 060 . 18 . For the six preceding years we had only deficits , the aggregate of which from 1894 to 1899 , inclusive , amounted to 283 , 022 , 991 . 14 . The receipts for the year from all sources , exclusive of postal revenues , aggregated 567 , 240 , 851 . 89 , and expenditures for all purposes , except for the administration of the postal department , aggregated 487 , 713 , 791 . 71 . The receipts from customs were 233 , 164 , 871 . 16 , an increase over the preceding year Of 27 , 036 , 389 . 41 . The receipts from internal revenue were 295 , 327 , 926 . 76 , an increase Of 21 , 890 , 765 . 25 over 1899 . The receipts from miscellaneous sources were 38 , 748 , 053 . 97 , as against 36 , 394 , 976 . 92 for the previous year . It is gratifying also to note that during the year a considerable reduction is shown in the expenditures of the Government . The War Department expenditures for the fiscal year 1900 were 134 , 774 , 767 . 78 , a reduction of 95 , 066 , 486 . 69 over those of 1899 . In the Navy Department the expenditures were 55 , 953 , 077 . 72 for the year 1900 , as against 63 , 942 , 104 . 25 for the preceding year , a decrease of 7 , 989 , 026 . 53 . In the expenditures on account of Indians there was a decrease in 1900 over 1899 Of 2 , 630 , 604 . 38 and in the civil and miscellaneous expenses for 1900 there was a reduction Of 13 , 418 , 065 . 74 . Because of the excess of revenues over expenditures the Secretary of the Treasury was enabled to apply bonds and other securities to the sinking fund to the amount Of 56 , 544 , 556 . 06 . The details of the sinking fund are set forth in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury , to which I invite attention . The Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts for the current fiscal year will aggregate 580 , 000 , 000 and the expenditures 500 , 000 , 000 , leaving an excess of revenues over expenditures of 80 , 000 , 000 . The present condition of the Treasury is one of undoubted strength . The available cash balance November 30 was 139 , 303 , 794 . 50 . Under the form of statement prior to the financial law of March 14 last there would have been included in the statement of available cash gold coin and bullion held for the redemption of United States notes . If this form were pursued , the cash balance including the present gold reserve of 150 , 000 , 000 , would be 289 , 303 , 794 . 50 . Such balance November 30 , 1899 , was 296 , 495 , 301 . 55 . In the general fund , which is wholly separate from the reserve and trust funds , there was on November 30 , 70 , 090 , 073 . 15 in gold coin and bullion , to which should be added 22 , 957 , 300 in gold certificates subject to issue , against which there is held in the Division of Redemption gold coin and bullion , making a total holding of free gold amounting to 93 , 047 , 373 . 15 . It will be the duty as I am sure it will be the disposition of the Congress to provide whatever further legislation is needed to insure the continued parity under all conditions between our two forms of metallic money , silver and gold . Our surplus revenues have permitted the Secretary of the Treasury since the close of the fiscal year to call in the funded loan of 1891 continued at 2 per cent , in the sum of 25 , 364 , 500 . To and including November 30 , 23 , 458 , 100 Of these bonds have been paid . This sum , together with the amount which may accrue from further redemptions under the call , will be applied to the sinking fund . The law of March 14 , 1900 , provided for refunding into 2 per cent thirty year bonds , payable , principal and interest , in gold coin of the present standard value , that portion of the public debt represented by the 3 per cent bonds of 1908 , the 4 percents Of 1907 , and the 5 percents of 1904 , Of which there was outstanding at the date of said law 839 , 149 , 930 , The holders of the old bonds presented them for exchange between March 14 and November 30 to the amount of 364 , 943 , 750 . The net saving to the Government on these transactions aggregates 9 , 106 , 166 . Another effect of the operation , as stated by the Secretary , is to reduce the charge upon the Treasury for the payment of interest from the dates of refunding to February 1 , 1904 , by the sum of more than seven million dollars annually . From February 1 , 1904 , to July 1 , 11907 , the annual interest charge will be reduced by the sum of more than five millions , and for the thirteen months ending August 1 , 1908 , by about one million . The full details of the refunding are given in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury . The beneficial effect of the financial act of 1900 , so far as it relates to a modification of the national banking act , is already apparent . The provision for the incorporation of national banks with a capital of not less than 25 , 000 in places not exceeding three thousand inhabitants has resulted in the extension of banking facilities to many small communities hitherto unable to provide themselves with banking institutions under the national system . There were organized from the enactment of the law up to and including November 30 , 369 national banks , of which 266 were with capital less than 50 , 000 , and 103 with capital of 50 , 000 or more . It is worthy of mention that the greater number of banks being organized under the new law are in sections where the need of banking facilities has been most pronounced . Iowa stands first , with 30 banks of the smaller class , while Texas , Oklahoma , Indian Territory , and the middle and western sections of the country have also availed themselves largely of the privileges under the new law . A large increase in national bank note circulation has resulted from the provision of the act which permits national banks to issue circulating notes to the par value of the United States bonds de . posited as security instead of only go per cent thereof , as heretofore . The increase in circulating notes from March 14 to November 30 is 77 , 889 , 570 . The party in power is committed to such legislation as will better make the currency responsive to the varying needs of business at all seasons and in all sections . Our foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial and industrial progress . The total of imports and exports for the first time in the history of the country exceeded two billions of dollars . The exports are greater than they have ever been before , the total for the fiscal year 1900 being 1 , 394 , 483 , 082 , an increase over 1899 of 167 , 459 , 780 , an increase over 1898 of 163 , 000 , 752 , over 1897 Of 343 , 489 , 526 , and greater than 1896 by 511 , 876 , 144 . The growth of manufactures in the United States is evidenced by the fact that exports of manufactured products largely exceed those of any previous year , their value for 1900 being 433 , 851 , 756 , against 339 , 592 , 146 in 1899 , an increase of 28 per cent . Agricultural products were also exported during 1900 in greater volume than in 1899 , the total for the year being 835 , 858 , 123 , against 784 , 776 , 142 in 1899 . The imports for the year amounted to 849 , 941 , 184 , an increase over 1899 of 152 , 792 , 695 . This increase is largely in materials for manufacture , and is in response to the rapid development of manufacturing in the United States . While there was imported for use in manufactures in 1900 material to the value of 79 , 768 , 972 in excess of 1899 , it is reassuring to observe that there is a tendency toward decrease in the importation of articles manufactured ready for consumption , which in 1900 formed 15 . 17 per cent of the total imports , against 15 . 54 per cent in 1899 and 21 . 09 per cent in 1896 . I recommend that the Congress at its present session reduce the internal revenue taxes imposed to meet the expenses of the war with Spain . in the sum of thirty millions of dollars . This reduction should be secured by the remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be the most burdensome to the industries of the people . I specially urge that there be included in whatever reduction is made the legacy tax on bequests for public uses of a literary , educational , or charitable character . American vessels during the past three years have carried about 9 per cent of our exports and imports . Foreign ships should carry the least , not the greatest , part of American trade . The remarkable growth of our steel industries , the progress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade , and our steadily maintained expenditures for the Navy have created an opportunity to place the United States in the 6rst rank of commercial maritime powers . Besides realizing a proper national aspiration this will mean the establishment and healthy growth along all our coasts of a distinctive national industry , expanding the field for the profitable employment of labor and capital . It will increase the transportation facilities and reduce freight charges on the vast volume of products brought from the interior to the seaboard for export , and will strengthen an arm of the national defense upon which the founders of the Government and their successors have relied . In again urging immediate action by the Congress on measures to promote American shipping and foreign trade , I direct attention to the recommendations on the subject in previous messages , and particularly to the opinion expressed in the message of 1899 I am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our merchant marine , which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild our sea carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture , which , with the increase of our Navy , mean more work and wages to our countrymen , as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part of the world . The attention of the Congress is invited to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report for legislation in behalf of the Revenue Cutter Service , and favorable action is urged . In my last annual message to the Congress I called attention to the necessity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to exist in connection with combinations of capital organized into trusts , and again invite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time , which concluded with these words It is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the several States is much to be desired . It is to be hoped that such uniformity , founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations , may be obtained , and that means may be found for the Congress , within the limitations of its constitutional power , so to supplement an effective code of State legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rules to which I have referred . The whole question is so important and far reaching that I am sure no part of it will be lightly considered , but every phase of it will have the studied deliberation of the Congress , resulting in wise and judicious action . Restraint upon such combinations as are injurious , and which are within Federal jurisdiction , should be promptly applied by the Congress . In my last annual message I dwelt at some length upon the condition of affairs in the Philippines . While seeking to impress upon you that the grave responsibility of the future government of those islands rests with the Congress of the United States , I abstained from recommending at that time a specific and final form of government for the territory actually held by the United States forces and in which as long as insurrection continues the military arm must necessarily be supreme . I stated my purpose , until the Congress shall have made the formal expression of its will , to use the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in those distant islands as in all other places where our flag rightfully floats , placing , to that end , at the disposal of the army and navy all the means which the liberality of the Congress and the people have provided . No contrary expression of the will of the Congress having been made , I have steadfastly pursued the purpose so declared , employing the civil arm as well toward the accomplishment of pacification and the institution of local governments within the lines of authority and law . Progress in the hoped for direction has been favorable . Our forces have successfully controlled the greater part of the islands , overcoming the organized forces of the insurgents and carrying order and administrative regularity to all quarters . What opposition remains is for the most part scattered , obeying no concerted plan of strategic action , operating only by the methods common to the traditions of guerrilla warfare , which , while ineffective to alter the general control now established , are still sufficient to beget insecurity among the populations that have felt the good results of our control and thus delay the conferment upon them of the fuller measures of local self government , of education , and of industrial and agricultural development which we stand ready to give to them . By the spring of this year the effective opposition of the dissatisfied Tagals to the authority of the United States was virtually ended , thus opening the door for the extension of a stable administration over much of the territory of the Archipelago . Desiring to bring this about , I appointed in March last a civil Commission composed of the William Taft , of Ohio Dean Worcester , of Michigan the Luke Wright , of Tennessee the Henry Ide , of Vermont , and Bernard Moses , of California . The aims of their mission and the scope of their authority are clearly set forth in my instructions of April 7 , 1900 , addressed to the Secretary of War to be transmitted to them In the message transmitted to the Congress on the 5th of December , 1899 , 1 said . sneaking of the Philippine Islands 11 As long as the insurrection continues the military arm must necessarily be supreme . But there is no reason why steps should not be taken from time to time to inaugurate governments essentially popular in their form as fast as territory is held and controlled by our troops . To this end I am considering the advisability of the return of the Commission , or such of the members thereof as can be secured , to aid the existing authorities and facilitate this work throughout the islands . To give effect to the intention thus expressed , I have appointed William Taft , of Ohio Dean Worcester , of Michigan Non . Luke Wright , of Tennessee Henry Ide , of Vermont , and Bernard Moses , of California , Commissioners to the Philippine Islands to continue and perfect the work of organizing and establishing civil government already commenced by the military authorities , subject in all respects to any laws which Congress may hereafter enact . The Commissioners named will meet and act as a board , and the William Taft t is designated as president of the board . It is probable that the transfer of authority from military commanders to civil officers will be gradual and will occupy a considerable period . Its successful accomplishment and the maintenance of peace and order in the meantime will require the most perfect co operation between the civil and military authorities in the islands , and both should be directed during the transition period by the same Executive Department . The Commission will therefore report to the Secretary of War , and all their action will be subject to your approval and control . You will instruct the Commission to proceed to the city of Manila , where they will make their principal office , and to communicate with the Military Governor of the Philippine Islands , whom you will at the same time direct to render to them every assistance within his power in the performance of their duties . Without hampering them by too specific instructions , they should in general be enjoined , after making themselves familiar with the conditions and needs of the country , to devote their attention in the first instance to the establishment of municipal governments , in which the natives of the islands , both in the cities and in the rural communities , shall be afforded the opportunity to manage their own local affairs to the fullest extent of which they are capable and subject to the least degree of supervision and control which a careful study of their capacities and observation of the workings of native control show to be consistent with the maintenance of law , order , and loyalty . The next subject in order of importance should be the organization of government in the larger administrative divisions corresponding to counties , departments , or provinces , in which the common interests of many or several municipalities failing within the same tribal lines , or the same natural geographical limits , may best be subserved by a common administration . Whenever the Commission is of the opinion that the condition of affairs in the islands is such that the central administration may safely be transferred from military to civil control they will report that conclusion to you , with their recommendations as to the form of central government to be established for the purpose of taking over the control . Beginning with the 1st day of September , 1900 , the authority to exercise , subject to my approval , through the Secretary of War , that part of the power of government in the Philippine Islands which is of a legislative nature is to be transferred from the Military Governor of the islands to this Commission , to be thereafter exercised by them in the place and stead of the Military Governor , under such rules and regulations as you shall prescribe , until the establishment of the civil central government for the islands contemplated in the last foregoing paragraph , or until Congress shall otherwise provide . Exercise of this legislative authority will include the making of rules and orders , having the effect of law , for the raising of revenue by taxes , customs duties , and imposts the appropriation and expenditure of public funds of the islands the establishment of an educational system throughout t1he islands the establishment of a system to secure an efficient civil service the organization and establishment of courts the organization and establishment of municipal and departmental governments , and all other matters of a civil nature for which the Military Governor is now competent to provide by rules or orders of a legislative character . The Commission will also have power during the same period to appoint to office such officers under the judicial , educational , and civil service systems and in the municipal and departmental governments as shall be provided for . Until the complete transfer of control the Military Governor will remain the chief executive head of the government of the islands , and will exercise the executive authority now possessed by him and not herein expressly assigned to the Commission , subject , however , to the rules and orders enacted by the Commission in the exercise of the legislative powers conferred upon them . In the meantime the municipal and departmental governments will continue to report to the Military Governor and be subject to his administrative supervision and control , under your direction , but that supervision and control will be confined within the narrowest limits consistent with the requirement that the powers of government in the municipalities and departments shall be honestly and effectively exercised and that law and order and individual freedom shall be maintained . All legislative rules and orders , establishments of government , and appointments to office by the Commission will take effect immediately , or at such times as they shall designate , subject to your approval and action upon the coming in of the Commission s reports , which are to be made from time to time as their action is taken . Wherever civil governments are constituted under the direction of the Commission such military posts , garrisons , and forces will be continued for the suppression of insurrection and brigandage and the maintenance of law and order as the Military Commander shall deem requisite , and the military forces shall be at all times subject , under his orders , to the call of the civil authorities for the maintenance of law and order and the enforcement of their authority . In the establishment of municipal governments the Commission will take as the basis of their work the governments established by the Military Governor under his order of August 8 , 1899 . and under the report of the board constituted by the Military Governor by his order of January 29 , 1900 , to formulate and report a plan of municipal government , of which His Honor Cayetano Arellano , President of the Audiencia , was chairman , and they will give to the conclusions of that board the weight and consideration which the high character and distinguished abilities of its members justify . In the constitution of departmental or provincial governments they will give especial attention to the existing government of the island of Negros , constituted , with the approval of the people of that island , under the order of the Military Governor of July 22 , 1899 , and after verifying , so far as may be practicable , the reports of the successful working of that government they will be guided by the experience thus acquired so far as it may be applicable to the condition existing in other portions of the Philippines . They will avail themselves , to the fullest degree practicable , of the conclusions reached by the previous Commission to the Philippines . In the distribution of powers among the governments organized by the Commission , the presumption is always to be in favor of the smaller subdivision , so that all the powers which can properly be exercised by the municipal government shall be vested in that government , and all the powers of a more general character which can be exercised by the departmental government shall be vested in that government , and so that in the governmental system , which is the result of the process , the central government of the islands , following the example of the distribution of the powers between the States and the National Government of the United States , shall have no direct administration except of matters of purely general concern , and shall have only such supervision and control over local governments as may be necessary to secure and enforce faithful and efficient administration by local officers . The many Different degrees of civilization and varieties of custom and capacity among the people of the different islands preclude very definite instruction as to the part which the people shall take in the selection of their own officers but these general rules are to be observed That in all cases the municipal officers , who administer the local affairs of the people , are to be selected by the people , and that wherever officers of more extended jurisdiction are to be selected in any way , natives of the islands are to be preferred , and if they can be found competent and willing to perform the duties , they are to receive the offices in preference to any others . It will be necessary to fill some offices for the present with Americans which after a time may well be filled by natives of the islands . As soon as practicable a system for ascertaining the merit and fitness of candidates for civil office should be put in force . An indispensable qualification for all offices and positions of trust and authority in the islands must be absolute and unconditional loyalty to the United States , and absolute and unhampered authority and power to remove and punish any officer deviating from that standard must at all times be retained in the bands of the central authority of the islands . In all the forms of government and administrative provisions which they are authorized to prescribe the Commission should bear in mind that the government which they are establishing is designed not for our satisfaction , or for the expression of our theoretical views , but for the happiness , peace , and prosperity of tile people of the Philippine Islands , and the measures adopted should be made to conform to their customs , their habits , and even heir prejudices , to the fullest extent consistent with the accomplishment of the Indispensable requisites of just and effective government . At the same time the Commission should bear in mind , and the people of the islands should be made plainly to understand , that there are certain great principles of government which have been made the basis of our governmental system which we deem essential to the rule of law and the maintenance of individual freedom , and of which they have , unfortunately , been denied the experience possessed by us that there are also certain practical rules of government which we have found to be essential to the preservation of these great principles of liberty and law , and that these principles and these rules of government must be established and maintained in their islands for the sake of their liberty and happiness , however much they may conflict with the customs or laws of procedure with which they are familiar . It is evident that the most enlightened thought of the Philippine Islands fully appreciates the importance of these principles and rules , and they will inevitably within a short time command universal assent . Upon every division and branch of the government of the Philippines , therefore , must be imposed these inviolable rules That no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation , to be confronted with the witnesses against him , to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense that excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted that no person shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense , or be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself that the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist except as a punishment for crime that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed that no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the press , or the rights of the people to peaceably assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances that no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , and that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed . It will be the duty of the Commission to make a thorough investigation into the titles to the large tracts of land held or claimed by individuals or by religious orders into the justice of the claims and complaints made against Stich landholders by the people of the island or any part of the people , and to seek by wise and peaceable measures a just settlement of the controversies and redress of wrongs which have caused strife and bloodshed in the past . In the performance of this duty the Commission is enjoined to see that no injustice is done to have regard for substantial rights and equity , disregarding technicalities so far as substantial right permits , and to observe the following rules That the provision of the Treaty of Paris pledging the United States to the protection of all rights of property in the islands , and as well the principle of our own Government which prohibits the taking of private property without due process of law , shall not be violated that the welfare of the people of the islands , which should be a paramount consideration , shall be attained consistently with this rule of property right that if it becomes necessary for the public interest of the people of the islands to dispose of claims to property which the Commission finds to be not lawfully acquired and held disposition shall be made thereof by due legal procedure , in which there shall be full opportunity for fair and impartial hearing and judgment that if the same public interests require the extinguishment of property rights lawfully acquired and held due compensation shall be made out of the public treasury therefore that no form of religion and no minister of religion shall be forced upon any community or upon any citizen of the islands that , upon the other hand , no minister of religion shall be interfered with or molested in following his calling . and that the separation between State and Church shall be real , entire , and absolute . It will be the duty of the Commission to promote and extend , and , as they find occasion , to improve the system of education already inaugurated by the military authorities . In doing this they should regard as of first importance the extension of a system of primary education which shall be free to all , and which shall tend to fit the people for the duties of citizenship and for the ordinary avocations of a civilized community . This instruction should be given in the first instance in every part of the islands in the language of the people . In view of the great number of languages spoken by the different tribes , it is especially important to the prosperity of the islands that a common medium of communication may be established , and it is obviously desirable that this medium should be the English language . Especial attention should be at once given to affording full opportunity to all the people of the islands to acquire the use of the English language . It may be well that the main changes which should be made in the system of taxation and in the body of the laws under which the people are governed , except such changes as have already been made by the military government , should be relegated to the civil government which is to be established under the auspices of the Commission . It will , however , be the duty of the Commission to inquire diligently as to whether there are any further changes which ought not to be delayed , and if so , they are authorized to make such changes subject to your approval . In doing so they are to bear in mind that taxes which tend 6 penalize or repress industry and enterprise are to be avoided that provisions for taxation should be simple , so that they may be understood by the people that they should affect the fewest practicable subjects of taxation which will serve for the general distribution of the burden . The main body of the laws which regulate the rights and obligations of the people should be maintained with as little interference as possible . Changes made should be mainly in procedure , and in the criminal laws to secure speedy and impartial trials , and at the same time effective administration and respect for individual rights . In dealing with the uncivilized tribes of the islands the Commission should adopt the same course followed by Congress in permitting the tribes of our North American Indians to maintain their tribal organization and government , and under which many of those tribes are now living in peace and contentment , surrounded by a civilization to which they are unable or unwilling to conform . Such tribal governments should , however , be subjected to wise and firm regulation , and , without undue or petty interference , constant and active effort should be exercised to prevent barbarous practices and introduce civilized customs . Upon all officers and employees of the United States , both civil and military , should be impressed a sense of the duty to observe not merely the material but the personal and social rights of the people of the islands , and to treat them with the same courtesy and respect for their personal dignity which the people of the United States are accustomed W require from each other . The articles of capitulation of the city of Manila on the 13th of August , 1898 , concluded with these words This city , its inhabitants , its churches and religious worship , its educational establishments , and its private property of all descriptions , are placed under the special safeguard of the faith and honor of the American Army . I believe that this pledge has been faithfully kept . As high and sacred an obligation rests upon the Government of the United States to give protection for property and life , civil and religious freedom , and wise , firm , and unselfish guidance in the paths of peace and prosperity to all the people of the Philippine Islands . I charge this Commission to labor for the full performance of this obligation , which concerns the honor and conscience of their country , in the firm hope that through their labors all the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands may come to look back with gratitude to the day when God gave victory to American arms at Manila and set their land under the sovereignty and the protection of the people of the United States . Coincidently with the entrance of the Commission upon its labors I caused to be issued by General MacArthur , the Military Governor of the Philippines , on June 21 , 1900 , a proclamation of amnesty in generous terms , of which many of the insurgents took advantage , among them a number of important leaders . This Commission , composed of eminent citizens representing the diverse geographical and political interests of the country , and bringing to their task the ripe fruits of long and intelligent service in educational , administrative , and judicial careers , made great progress from the outset . As early as August 21 , 1900 , it submitted a preliminary report , which will be laid before the Congress , and from which it appears that already the good effects of returning order are felt that business , interrupted by hostilities , is improving as peace extends that a larger area is under sugar cultivation than ever before that the customs revenues are greater than at any time during the Spanish rule that economy and efficiency in the military administration have created a surplus fund of 6 , 000 , 000 , available for needed public improvements that a stringent civil service law is in preparation that railroad communications are expanding , opening up rich districts , and that a comprehensive scheme of education is being organized . Later reports from the Commission show yet more encouraging advance toward insuring the benefits of liberty and good government to the Filipinos , in the interest of humanity and with the aim of building up an enduring , self supporting , and self administering community in those far eastern seas . I would impress upon the Congress that whatever legislation may be enacted in respect to the Philippine Islands should be along these generous lines . The fortune of war has thrown upon this nation an unsought trust which should be unselfishly discharged , and devolved upon this Government a moral as well as material responsibility toward these millions whom we have freed from an oppressive yoke . I have on another occasion called the Filipinos the wards of the nation . Our obligation as guardian was not lightly assumed it must not be otherwise than honestly fulfilled , aiming first of all to benefit those who have come under our fostering care . It is our duty so to treat them that our flag may be no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon and the fertile zones of Mindanao and Negros than it is at home , that there as here it shall be the revered symbol of liberty , enlightenment , and progress in every avenue of development The Filipinos are a race quick to learn and to profit by knowledge He would be rash who , with the teachings of contemporaneous history in view , would fix a limit to the degree of culture and advancement yet within the reach of these people if our duty toward them be faithfully performed . The civil government of Puerto Rico provided for by the act of the Congress approved April 12 , 1900 is in successful operation The courts have been established . The Governor and his associates , working intelligently and harmoniously , are meeting with Commendable success . On the 6th of November a general election was held in the island for members of the Legislature , and the body elected has been called to convene on the first Monday of December . I recommend that legislation be enacted by the Congress conferring upon the Secretary of the Interior supervision over the public lands in Puerto Rico , and that he be directed to ascertain the location and quantity of lands the title to which remained in the Crown of Spain at the date of cession of Puerto Rico to the United States , and that appropriations necessary for surveys be made , and that the methods of the disposition of such lands be prescribed by law . On the 25th of July , 1900 , I directed that a call be issued for an election in Cuba for members of a constitutional convention to frame a constitution as a basis for a stable and independent government in the island . In pursuance thereof the Military Governor issued the following instructions Whereas the Congress of the United States , by its joint resolution of April 20 , 1898 , declared That the people of the island of Cuba are , and of right ought to be , free and independent . That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty , jurisdiction , or control over said island except for the pacification thereof , and asserts its determination , when that is accomplished , to leave the government and control of the island to its people And whereas , the people of Cuba have established municipal governments , deriving their authority from the suffrages of the people given under just and equal laws , and are now ready , in like manner , to proceed to the establishment of a general government which shall assume and exercise sovereignty , jurisdiction , and control over the island Therefore , it is ordered that a general election be held in the island of Cuba on the third Saturday of September , in the year nineteen hundred , to elect delegates to a convention to meet in the city of Havana at twelve of the clock noon on the first Monday of November , in the year nineteen hundred , to frame and adopt a constitution for the people of Cuba , and as a part thereof to provide for and agree with the Government of the United States upon the relations to exist between that Government and the Government of Cuba , and to provide for the election by the people of officers under such constitution and the transfer of government to the officers so elected . The election will be held in the several voting precincts of the island under , and pursuant to , the provisions of the electoral law of April 18 , 1900 , and the amendments thereof . The election was held on the 15th of September , and the convention assembled on the 5th of November , 1900 , and is now in session . In calling the convention to order , the Military Governor of Cuba made the following statement As Military Governor of the island , representing the President of the United States , I call this convention to order . It will be your duty , first , to frame and adopt a constitution for Cuba , and whet that has been done to formulate what in your opinion ought to be the relations between Cuba and the United States . The constitution must be adequate to secure a stable , orderly , and free government . When you have formulated the relations which in your opinion ought to exist between Cuba and the United States the Government of the United States will doubtless take such action on its part as shall lead to a final and authoritative agreement between the people of the two countries to the promotion of their common interests . All friends of Cuba will follow your deliberations with the deepest interest , earnestly desiring that you shall reach just conclusions , and that by the dignity , individual self restraint , and wise conservatism which shall characterize your proceedings the capacity of the Cuban people for representative government may be signally illustrated . The fundamental distinction between true representative government and dictatorship is that in the former every representative of the people , in whatever office , confines himself strictly within the limits of his defined powers . Without such restraint there can be no free constitutional government . Under the order pursuant to which you have been elected and convened you have no duty and no authority to take part in the present government of the island . Your powers are strictly limited by the terms of that order . When the convention concludes its labors I will transmit to the Congress the constitution as framed by the convention for its consideration and for such action as it may deem advisable . I renew the recommendation made in my special message of February 10 , 1899 , as to the necessity for cable communication between the United States and Hawaii , with extension to Manila . Since then circumstances have strikingly emphasized this need . Surveys have shown the entire feasibility of a chain of cables which at each stopping place shall touch on American territory , so that the system shall be under our own complete control . Manila once within telegraphic reach , connection with the systems of the Asiatic coast would open increased and profitable opportunities for a more direct cable route from our shores to the Orient than is now afforded by the trans Atlantic , continental , and trans Asian lines . I urge attention to this important matter The present strength of the Army is 100 , 000 men 65 , ooo regulars and 35 , 000 volunteers . Under the act of March 2 , 1899 , on the 3oth of June next the present volunteer force will be discharged and the Regular Army will be reduced to 2 , 447 officers and 29 , 025 enlisted men . In 1888 a Board of Officers convened by President Cleveland adopted a comprehensive scheme of coast defense fortifications which involved the outlay of something over one hundred million dollars . This plan received the approval of the Congress , and since then regular appropriations have been made and the work of fortification has steadily progressed . More than sixty millions of dollars have been invested in a great number of forts and guns , with all the complicated and scientific machinery and electrical appliances necessary for their use . The proper care of this defensive machinery requires men trained in its use . The number of men necessary to perform this duty alone is ascertained by the War Department , at a minimum allowance , to be 18 , 420 . There are fifty eight or more military posts in the United States other than the coast defense fortifications . The number of these posts is being constantly increased by the Congress . More than 22 , 000 , 000 have been expended in building and equipment , and they can only be cared for by the Regular Army . The posts now in existence and others to be built provide for accommodations for , and if fully garrisoned require , 26 , 000 troops . Many of these posts are along our frontier or at important strategic points , the occupation of which is necessary . We have in Cuba between 5 , 000 and 6 , 000 troops . For the present our troops in that island cannot be withdrawn or materially diminished , and certainly not until the conclusion of the labors of the constitutional convention now in session and a government provided by the new constitution shall have been established and its stability assured . In Puerto Rico we have reduced the garrisons to 1 , 636 , which includes 879 native troops . There is no room for further reduction here . We will be required to keep a considerable force in the Philippine Islands for some time to come . From the best information obtainable we will need there for the immediate future from 45 , 000 to 60 , 000 men . I am sure the number may be reduced as the insurgents shall come to acknowledge the authority of the United States , of which there are assuring indications . It must be apparent that we will require an army of about 60 , 000 , and that during present conditions in Cuba and the Philippines the President should have authority to increase the force to the present number of 100 , 000 . Included in this number authority should be given to raise native troops in the Philippines up to 15 , 000 , which the Taft Commission believe will be more effective in detecting and suppressing guerrillas , assassins , and ladrones than our own soldiers . The full discussion of this subject by the Secretary of War in his annual report is called to your earnest attention . I renew the recommendation made in my last annual message that the Congress provide a special medal of honor for the volunteers , regulars , sailors , and marines on duty in the Philippines who voluntarily remained in the service after their terms of enlistment had expired . I favor the recommendation of the Secretary of War for the detail oil officers from the line of the Army when vacancies occur in the Adjutant General s Department , Inspector General s Department , Quartermaster s Department , Subsistence Department , Pay Department , Ordnance Department , and Signal Corps . The Army cannot be too highly commended for its faithful and effective service in active military operations in the field and the difficult work of civil administration . The continued and rapid growth of the postal service is a sure index of the great and increasing business activity of the country . Its most striking new development is the extension of rural free delivery . This has come almost wholly within the last year . At the beginning of the fiscal year 1899 , 1900 the number of routes in operation was only 391 , and most of these had been running less than twelve months . On the 15th of November , 1900 , the number had increased to 2 , 614 , reaching into forty four States and Territories , and serving a population of 1 , 801 , 524 . The number of applications now pending and awaiting action nearly equals all those granted up to the present time , and by the close of the current fiscal year about 4 , ooo routes will have been established , providing for the daily delivery of mails at the scattered homes of about three and a half millions of rural population . This service ameliorates the isolation of farm life , conduces to good roads , and quickens and extends the dissemination of general information . Experience thus far has tended to allay the apprehension that it would be so expensive as to forbid its general adoption or make it a serious burden . Its actual application has shown that it increases postal receipts , and can be accompanied by reductions in other branches of the service , so that the augmented revenues and the accomplished savings together materially reduce the net cost . The evidences which point to these conclusions are presented in detail in the annual report of the Postmaster General , which with its recommendations is commended to the consideration of the Congress . The full development of this special service , however , requires such a large outlay of money that it should be undertaken only after a careful study and thorough understanding of all that it involves . Very efficient service has been rendered by the Navy in connection with the insurrection in the Philippines and the recent disturbance in China . A very satisfactory settlement has been made of the long pending question of the manufacture of armor plate . A reasonable price has been secured and the necessity for a Government armor plant avoided . I approve of the recommendations of the Secretary for new vessels and for additional officers and men which the required increase of the Navy makes necessary . I commend to the favorable action of the Congress the measure now pending for the erection of a statue to the memory of the late Admiral David Porter . I commend also the establishment of a national naval reserve and of the grade of vice admiral . Provision should be made , as recommended by the Secretary , for suitable rewards for special merit . Many officers who rendered the most distinguished service during the recent war with Spain have received in return no recognition from the Congress . The total area of public lands as given by the Secretary of the Interior is approximately 1 , 071 , 881 , 662 acres , of which 917 , 135 , 880 acres are undisposed of and 154 , 745 , 782 acres have been reserved for various purposes . The public lands disposed of during the year amount to 13 , 453 , 887 . 96 acres , including 62 , 423 . 09 acres of Indian lands , an increase Of 4 , 271 , 474 . 80 over the preceding year . The total receipts from the sale of public lands during the fiscal year were 4 , 379 , 758 . 10 , an increase of 1 , 309 , 620 . 76 over the preceding year . The results obtained from our forest policy have demonstrated its wisdom and the necessity in the interest of the public for its continuance and increased appropriations by the Congress for the carrying on of the work . On June 30 , 1900 , there were thirty seven forest reserves , created by Presidential proclamations under section 24 Of the act of March 3 , 1891 , embracing an area Of 46 , 425 , 529 acres . During the past year the Olympic Reserve , in the State of Washington , was reduced 265 , 040 acres , leaving its present area at 1 , 923 , 840 acres . The Prescott Reserve , in Arizona , was increased from 10 , 240 acres to 423 , 680 acres , and the Big Horn Reserve , in Wyoming , was increased from 1 , 127 , 680 acres to 1 , 180 , 800 acres . A new reserve the Santa Ynez , in California , embracing an area of 145 , 000 acres , was created during this year . On October 10 , 1900 , the Crow Creek Forest Reserve , in Wyoming , was created , with an area of 56 , 320 acres . At the end of the fiscal year there were on the pension roll 993 , 529 names , a net increase Of 2 , 010 over the fiscal year 1899 . The number added to the rolls during the year was 45 , 344 . The amount disbursed for Army pensions during the year was 134 , 700 , 597 . 24 and for Navy pensions 3 , 761 , 533 . 41 , a total of 138 , 462 , 130 . 65 , leaving an unexpended balance of 5 , 542 , 768 . 25 to be covered into the Treasury , which shows an increase over the previous year s expenditure Of 107 , 077 . 70 . There were 684 names added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at the first session of the Fifty sixth Congress . The act of May 9 , 1900 , among other things provides for an extension of income to widows pensioned under said act to 250 per annum . The Secretary of the Interior believes that by the operations of this act the number of persons pensioned under it will increase and the increased annual payment for pensions will be between 3 , 000 , 000 and 4 , 000 , 000 . The Government justly appreciates the services of its soldiers and sailors by making pension payments liberal beyond precedent to them , their widows and orphans . There were 26 , 540 letters patent granted , including reissues and designs , during the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1900 1 , 660 trademarks , 682 labels , and 93 prints registered . The number of patents which expired was 19 , 988 . The total receipts for patents were 1 , 358 , 228 . 35 . The expenditures were 1 , 247 , 827 . 58 , showing a surplus Of 110 , 400 . 77 The attention of the Congress is called to the report of the Secretary of the Interior touching the necessity for the further establishment of schools in the Territory of Alaska , and favorable action is invited thereon . Much interesting information is given in the report of the Governor of Hawaii as to the progress and development of the islands during the period from July 7 , 1898 , the date of the approval of the joint resolution of the Congress providing for their annexation , up to April 30 , 1900 , the date of the approval of the act providing a government for the Territory , and thereafter . The last Hawaiian census , taken in the year 1896 , gives a total population of 109 , 020 , Of Which 31 , 019 were native Hawaiians . The number of Americans reported was 8 , 485 . The results of the Federal census , taken this year , show the islands to have a total population Of 154 , 001 , showing an increase over that reported in 1896 of 44 , 981 , or 41 . 2 per cent . There has been marked progress in the educational , agricultural , and railroad development of the islands . In the Territorial act of April 30 , 1900 , section 7 of said act repeals Chapter 34 Of the Civil Laws of Hawaii whereby the Government was to assist in encouraging and developing the agricultural resources of the Republic , especially irrigation . The Governor of Hawaii recommends legislation looking to the development of such water supply as may exist on the public lands , with a view of promoting land settlement . The earnest consideration of the Congress is invited to this important recommendation and others , as embodied in the report of the Secretary of the Interior . The Director of the Census states that the work in connection with the Twelfth Census is progressing favorably . This national undertaking , ordered by the Congress each decade , has finally resulted in the collection of an aggregation of statistical facts to determine the industrial growth of the country , its manufacturing and mechanical resources , its richness in mines and forests , the number of its agriculturists , their farms and products , its educational and religious opportunities , as well as questions pertaining to sociological conditions . The labors of the officials in charge of the Bureau indicate that the four important and most desired subjects , namely , population , agricultural , manufacturing , and vital statistics , will be completed within the limit prescribed by the law of March 3 , 1899 . The field work incident to the above inquiries is now practically finished , and as a result the population of the States and Territories , including the Hawaiian Islands and Alaska , has been announced . The growth of population during the last decade amounts to over 13 , 000 , 000 , a greater numerical increase than in any previous census in the history of the country . Bulletins will be issued as rapidly as possible giving the population by States and Territories , by minor civil divisions . Several announcements of this kind have already been made , and it is hoped that the list will be completed by January 1 . Other bulletins giving the results of the manufacturing and agricultural inquiries will be given to the public as rapidly as circumstances will admit . The Director , while confident of his ability to complete the different branches of the undertaking in the allotted time , finds himself embarrassed by the lack of a trained force properly equipped for statistical work , thus raising the question whether in the interest of economy and a thorough execution of the census work there should not be retained in the Government employ a certain number of experts not only to aid in the preliminary organization prior to the taking of the decennial census , , but in addition to have the advantage in the field and office work of the Bureau of trained assistants to facilitate the early completion of this enormous undertaking . I recommend that the Congress at its present session apportion representation among the several States as provided by the Constitution . The Department of Agriculture has been extending its work during the past year , reaching farther for new varieties of seeds and plants co operating more fully with the States and Territories in research along useful lines making progress in meteorological work relating to lines of wireless telegraphy and forecasts for ocean going vessels continuing inquiry as to animal disease looking into the extent and character of food adulteration outlining plans for the care , preservation , and intelligent harvesting of our woodlands studying soils that producers may cultivate with better knowledge of conditions , and helping to clothe desert places with grasses suitable to our and regions . Our island possessions are being considered that their peoples may be helped to produce the tropical products now so extensively brought into the United States . Inquiry into methods of improving our roads has been active during the year help has been given to many localities , and scientific investigation of material in the States and Territories has been inaugurated . Irrigation problems in our semiarid regions are receiving careful and increased consideration . An extensive exhibit at Paris of the products of agriculture has made the peoples of many countries more familiar with the varied products of our fields and their comparative excellence . The collection of statistics regarding our crops is being improved and sources of information are being enlarged , to the end that producers may have the earliest advices regarding crop conditions . There has never been a time when those for whom it was established have shown more appreciation of the services of the Department . In my annual message of December 5 , 1898 , 1 called attention to the necessity for some amendment of the alien contract law . There still remain important features of the rightful application of the eight hour law for the benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration , and I again commend these subjects to the careful attention of the Congress . That there may be secured the best service possible in the Philippine Islands , I have issued , under date of November 30 , 1900 , the following order The United States Civil Service Commission is directed to render such assistance as may be practicable to the Civil Service Board , created under the act of the United States Philippine Commission , for the establishment and maintenance of an honest and efficient civil service in the Philippine Islands , and for that purpose to conduct examinations for the civil service of the Philippine islands , upon the request of the Civil Service Board of said islands , under such regulations as may be agreed upon by the said Board and the said United States Civil Service Commission . The Civil Service Commission is greatly embarrassed in its work for want of an adequate permanent force for clerical and other assistance . Its needs are fully set forth in its report . I invite attention to the report , and especially urge upon the Congress that this important bureau of the public service , which passes upon the qualifications and character of so large a number of the officers and employees of the Government , should be supported by all needed appropriations to secure promptness and efficiency . I am very much impressed with the statement made by the heads of all the Departments of the urgent necessity of a hall of public records . In every departmental building in Washington , so far as I am informed , the space for official records is not only exhausted , but the walls of rooms are lined with shelves , the middle floor space of many rooms is tilled with tile cases , and garrets and basements , which were never intended and are unfitted for their accommodation , are crowded with them . Aside from the inconvenience there is great danger , not only from fire , but from the weight of these records upon timbers not intended for their support . There should be a separate building especially designed for the purpose of receiving and preserving the annually accumulating archives of the several Executive Departments . Such a hall need not be a costly structure , but should be so arranged as to admit of enlargement from time to time . I urgently recommend that the Congress take early action in this matter . I transmit to the Congress a resolution adopted at a recent meeting of the American Bar Association concerning the proposed celebration of John Marshall Day , February 4 , 1901 . Fitting exercises have been arranged , and it is earnestly desired by the committee that the Congress may participate in this movement to honor the memory of the great jurist . The transfer of the Government to this city is a fact of great historical interest . Among the people there is a feeling of genuine pride in the Capital of the Republic . It is a matter of interest in this connection that in 1800 the population of the District of Columbia was 14 , 093 to day it is 278 , 718 . The population of the city of Washington was then 3 , 210 to day it is 218 , 196 . The Congress having provided for an appropriate national celebration of the Centennial Anniversary of the Establishment of the Seat of the Government in the District of Columbia , the committees authorized by it have prepared a programme for the 12th of December , 1900 , which date has been selected as the anniversary day . Deep interest has been shown in the arrangements for the celebration by the members of the committees of the Senate and House of Representatives , the committee of Governors appointed by the President , and the committees appointed by the citizens and inhabitants of the District of Columbia generally . The programme , in addition to a reception and other exercises at the Executive Mansion , provides commemorative exercises to be held jointly by the Senate and House of Representatives in the Hall of the House of Representatives , and a reception in the evening at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in honor of the Governors of the States and Territories . In our great prosperity we must guard against the danger it invites of extravagance in Government expenditures and appropriations and the chosen representatives of the people will , I doubt not , furnish an example in their legislation of that wise economy which in a season of plenty husbands for the future . In this era of great business activity and opportunity caution is not untimely . It will not abate , but strengthen , confidence . It will not retard , but promote , legitimate industrial and commercial expansion . Our growing power brings with it temptations and perils requiring constant vigilance to avoid . It must not be used to invite conflicts , nor for oppression , but for the more effective maintenance of those principles of equality and justice upon which our institutions and happiness depend . Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of our Government is liberty its superstructure peace .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Official information from our consuls in Cuba establishes the fact that a large number of American citizens in the island are in a state of destitution , suffering for want of food and medicines . This applies particularly to the rural districts of the central and eastern parts . The agricultural classes have been forced from their farms into the nearest towns , where they are without work or money . The local authorities of the several towns , however kindly disposed , are unable to relieve the needs of their own people , and are altogether powerless to help our citizens . The latest report of Consul General Lee estimates six to eight hundred Americans are without means of support . I have assured him that provisions would be made at once to relieve them . To that end I recommend that Congress make an appropriation of not less than 50 , 000 , to be immediately available for use , under the direction of the Secretary of State . It is desirable that a part of the sum which may be appropriated by Congress should , in the discretion of the Secretary of State , also be used for the transportation of American citizens who , desiring to return to the United States , are without means to do so .<speech_sep>
