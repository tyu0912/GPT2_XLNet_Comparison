When we first arrived at Camp David , the first thing upon which we agreed was to ask the people of the world to pray that our negotiations would be successful . Those prayers have been answered far beyond any expectations . We are privileged to witness tonight a significant achievement in the cause of peace , an achievement none thought possible a year ago , or even a month ago , an achievement that reflects the courage and wisdom of these two leaders . Through 13 long days at Camp David , we have seen them display determination and vision and flexibility which was needed to make this agreement come to pass . All of us owe them our gratitude and respect . They know that they will always have my personal admiration . There are still great difficulties that remain and many hard issues to be settled . The questions that have brought warfare and bitterness to the Middle East for the last 30 years will not be settled overnight . But we should all recognize the substantial achievements that have been made . One of the agreements that President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin are signing tonight is entitled , A Framework for Peace in the Middle East . This framework concerns the principles and some specifics , in the most substantive way , which will govern a comprehensive peace settlement . It deals specifically with the future of the West Bank and Gaza and the need to resolve the Palestinian problem in all its aspects . The framework document proposes a 5 year transitional period in the West Bank and Gaza during which the Israeli military government will be withdrawn and a self governing authority will be elected with full autonomy . It also provides for Israeli forces to remain in specified locations during this period to protect Israel s security . The Palestinians will have the right to participate in the determination of their own future , in negotiations which will resolve the final status of the West Bank and Gaza , and then to produce an Israeli Jordanian peace treaty . These negotiations will be based on all the provisions and all the principles of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 . And it provides that Israel may live in peace , within secure and recognized borders . And this great aspiration of Israel has been certified without constraint , with the greatest degree of enthusiasm , by President Sadat , the leader of one of the greatest nations on Earth . The other document is entitled , Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty Between Egypt and Israel . It provides for the full exercise of Egyptian sovereignty over the Sinai . It calls for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai and , after an interim withdrawal which will be accomplished very quickly , the establishment of normal , peaceful relations between the two countries , including diplomatic relations . Together with accompanying letters , which we will make public tomorrow , these two Camp David agreements provide the basis for progress and peace throughout the Middle East . There is one issue on which agreement has not been reached . Egypt states that the agreement to remove Israeli settlements from Egyptian territory is a prerequisite to a peace treaty . Israel states that the issue of the Israeli settlements should be resolved during the peace negotiations . That is a substantial difference . Within the next two weeks , the Knesset will decide on the issue of these settlements . Tomorrow night , I will go before the Congress to explain these agreements more fully and to talk about their implications for the United States and for the world . For the moment , and in closing , I want to speak more personally about my admiration for all of those who have taken part in this process and my hope that the promise of this moment will be fulfilled . During the last two weeks , the members of all three delegations have spent endless hours , day and night , talking , negotiating , grappling with problems that have divided their people for 30 years . Whenever there was a danger that human energy would fail , or patience would be exhausted or good will would run out and there were many such moments these two leaders and the able advisers in all delegations found the resources within them to keep the chances for peace alive . Well , the long days at Camp David are over . But many months of difficult negotiations still lie ahead . I hope that the foresight and the wisdom that have made this session a success will guide these leaders and the leaders of all nations as they continue the progress toward peace . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Good evening . This is a special night for me . Exactly 3 years ago , on July 15 , 1976 , I accepted the nomination of my party to run for President of the United States . I promised you a President who is not isolated from the people , who feels your pain , and who shares your dreams and who draws his strength and his wisdom from you . During the past 3 years I have spoken to you on many occasions about national concerns , the energy crisis , reorganizing the Government , our Nation s economy , and issues of war and especially peace . But over those years the subjects of the speeches , the talks , and the press conferences have become increasingly narrow , focused more and more on what the isolated world of Washington thinks is important . Gradually , you have heard more and more about what the Government thinks or what the Government should be doing and less and less about our Nation s hopes , our dreams , and our vision of the future . Ten days ago I had planned to speak to you again about a very important subject energy . For the fifth time I would have described the urgency of the problem and laid out a series of legislative recommendations to the Congress . But as I was preparing to speak , I began to ask myself the same question that I now know has been troubling many of you . Why have we not been able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem It is clear that the true problems of our Nation are much deeper deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages , deeper even than inflation or recession . And I realize more than ever that as President I need your help . So , I decided to reach out and listen to the voices of America . I invited to Camp David people from almost every segment of our society business and labor , teachers and preachers , Governors , mayors , and private citizens . And then I left Camp David to listen to other Americans , men and women like you . It has been an extraordinary 10 days , and I want to share with you what I have heard . First of all , I got a lot of personal advice . Let me quote a few of the typical comments that I wrote down . This from a southern Governor President , you are not leading this Nation you are just managing the Government . You do not see the people enough any more . Some of your Cabinet members do not seem loyal . There is not enough discipline among your disciples . Do not talk to us about politics or the mechanics of government , but about an understanding of our common good . President , we are in trouble . Talk to us about blood and sweat and tears . If you lead , President , we will follow . Many people talked about themselves and about the condition of our Nation . This from a young woman in Pennsylvania I feel so far from government . I feel like ordinary people are excluded from political power . And this from a young Chicano Some of us have suffered from recession all our lives . Some people have wasted energy , but others have not had anything to waste . And this from a religious leader No material shortage can touch the important things like God s love for us or our love for one another . And I like this one particularly from a black woman who happens to be the mayor of a small Mississippi town The big shots are not the only ones who are important . Remember , you cannot sell anything on Wall Street unless someone digs it up somewhere else first . This kind of summarized a lot of other statements President , we are confronted with a moral and a spiritual crisis . Several of our discussions were on energy , and I have a notebook full of comments and advice . I will read just a few . We cannot go on consuming 40 percent more energy than we produce . When we import oil we are also importing inflation plus unemployment . We have got to use what we have . The Middle East has only 5 percent of the world s energy , but the United States has 24 percent . And this is one of the most vivid statements Our neck is stretched over the fence and OPEC has a knife . There will be other cartels and other shortages . American wisdom and courage right now can set a path to follow in the future . This was a good one Be bold , President . We may make mistakes , but we are ready to experiment . And this one from a labor leader got to the heart of it The real issue is freedom . We must deal with the energy problem on a war footing . And the last that I will read When we enter the moral equivalent of war , President , do not issue us BB guns . These 10 days confirmed my belief in the decency and the strength and the wisdom of the American people , but it also bore out some of my longstanding concerns about our Nation s underlying problems . I know , of course , being President , that government actions and legislation can be very important . That is why I have worked hard to put my campaign promises into law and I have to admit , with just mixed success . But after listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world cannot fix what is wrong with America . So , I want to speak to you first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation . I want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to American democracy . I do not mean our political and civil liberties . They will endure . And I do not refer to the outward strength of America , a nation that is at peace tonight everywhere in the world , with unmatched economic power and military might . The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways . It is a crisis of confidence . It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will . We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our Nation . The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America . The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July . It is the idea which founded our Nation and has guided our development as a people . Confidence in the future has supported everything else public institutions and private enterprise , our own families , and the very Constitution of the United States . Confidence has defined our course and has served as a link between generations . We have always believed in something called progress . We have always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own . Our people are losing that faith , not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy . As a people we know our past and we are proud of it . Our progress has been part of the living history of America , even the world . We always believed that we were part of a great movement of humanity itself called democracy , involved in the search for freedom , and that belief has always strengthened us in our purpose . But just as we are losing our confidence in the future , we are also beginning to close the door on our past . In a nation that was proud of hard work , strong families , close knit communities , and our faith in God , too many of us now tend to worship self indulgence and consumption . Human identity is no longer defined by what one does , but by what one owns . But we have discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning . We have learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose . The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us . For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next 5 years will be worse than the past 5 years . Two thirds of our people do not even vote . The productivity of American workers is actually dropping , and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world . As you know , there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools , the news media , and other institutions . This is not a message of happiness or reassurance , but it is the truth and it is a warning . These changes did not happen overnight . They have come upon us gradually over the last generation , years that were filled with shocks and tragedy . We were sure that ours was a nation of the ballot , not the bullet , until the murders of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King , We were taught that our armies were always invincible and our causes were always just , only to suffer the agony of Vietnam . We respected the Presidency as a place of honor until the shock of Watergate . We remember when the phrase sound as a dollar was an expression of absolute dependability , until 10 years of inflation began to shrink our dollar and our savings . We believed that our Nation s resources were limitless until 1973 , when we had to face a growing dependence on foreign oil . These wounds are still very deep . They have never been healed . Looking for a way out of this crisis , our people have turned to the Federal Government and found it isolated from the mainstream of our Nation s life . Washington , C . , has become an island . The gap between our citizens and our Government has never been so wide . The people are looking for honest answers , not easy answers clear leadership , not false claims and evasiveness and politics as usual . What you see too often in Washington and elsewhere around the country is a system of government that seems incapable of action . You see a Congress twisted and pulled in every direction by hundreds of well financed and powerful special interests . You see every extreme position defended to the last vote , almost to the last breath by one unyielding group or another . You often see a balanced and a fair approach that demands sacrifice , a little sacrifice from everyone , abandoned like an orphan without support and without friends . Often you see paralysis and stagnation and drift . You do not like it , and neither do What can we do First of all , we must face the truth , and then we can change our course . We simply must have faith in each other , faith in our ability to govern ourselves , and faith in the future of this Nation . Restoring that faith and that confidence to America is now the most important task we face . It is a true challenge of this generation of Americans . One of the visitors to Camp David last week put it this way We have got to stop crying and start sweating , stop talking and start walking , stop cursing and start praying . The strength we need will not come from the White House , but from every house in America . We know the strength of America . We are strong . We can regain our unity . We can regain our confidence . We are the heirs of generations who survived threats much more powerful and awesome than those that challenge us now . Our fathers and mothers were strong men and women who shaped a new society during the Great Depression , who fought world wars , and who carved out a new charter of peace for the world . We ourselves are the same Americans who just 10 years ago put a man on the Moon . We are the generation that dedicated our society to the pursuit of human rights and equality . And we are the generation that will win the war on the energy problem and in that process rebuild the unity and confidence of America . We are at a turning point in our history . There are two paths to choose . One is a path I have warned about tonight , the path that leads to fragmentation and self interest . Down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom , the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over others . That path would be one of constant conflict between narrow interests ending in chaos and immobility . It is a certain route to failure . All the traditions of our past , all the lessons of our heritage , all the promises of our future point to another path , the path of common purpose and the restoration of American values . That path leads to true freedom for our Nation and ourselves . We can take the first steps down that path as we begin to solve our energy problem . Energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this Nation , and it can also be the standard around which we rally . On the battlefield of energy we can win for our Nation a new confidence , and we can seize control again of our common destiny . In little more than two decades we have gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries , at prices that are going through the roof . Our excessive dependence on OPEC has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people . This is the direct cause of the long lines which have made millions of you spend aggravating hours waiting for gasoline . It is a cause of the increased inflation and unemployment that we now face . This intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our Nation . The energy crisis is real . It is worldwide . It is a clear and present danger to our Nation . These are facts and we simply must face them What I have to say to you now about energy is simple and vitally important . Point one I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States . Beginning this moment , this Nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 never . From now on , every new addition to our demand for energy will be met from our own production and our own conservation . The generation long growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stopped dead in its tracks right now and then reversed as we move through the 1980 s , for I am tonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by one half by the end of the next decade a saving of over 4 1 2 million barrels of imported oil per day . Point two To ensure that we meet these targets , I will use my Presidential authority to set import quotas . I am announcing tonight that for 1979 and 1980 , I will forbid the entry into this country of one drop of foreign oil more than these goals allow . These quotas will ensure a reduction in imports even below the ambitious levels we set at the recent Tokyo summit . Point three To give us energy security , I am asking for the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our Nation s history to develop America s own alternative sources of fuel from coal , from oil shale , from plant products for gasohol , from unconventional gas , from the Sun . I propose the creation of an energy security corporation to lead this effort to replace 2 1 2 million barrels of imported oil per day by 1990 . The corporation will issue up to 5 billion in energy bonds , and I especially want them to be in small denominations so that average Americans can invest directly in America s energy security . Just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win World War Iso will we mobilize American determination and ability to win the energy war . Moreover , I will soon submit legislation to Congress calling for the creation of this Nation s first solar bank , which will help us achieve the crucial goal of 20 percent of our energy coming from solar power by the year 2000 . These efforts will cost money , a lot of money , and that is why Congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay . It will be money well spent . Unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil , these funds will be paid by Americans to Americans . These funds will go to fight , not to increase , inflation and unemployment . Point four I am asking Congress to mandate , to require as a matter of law , that our Nation s utility companies cut their massive use of oil by 50 percent within the next decade and switch to other fuels , especially coal , our most abundant energy source . Point five To make absolutely certain that nothing stands in the way of achieving these goals , I will urge Congress to create an energy mobilization board which , like the War Production Board in World War Iwill have the responsibility and authority to cut through the redtape , the delays , and the endless roadblocks to completing key energy projects . We will protect our environment . But when this Nation critically needs a refinery or a pipeline , we will build it . Point six I am proposing a bold conservation program to involve every State , county , and city and every average American in our energy battle . This effort will permit you to build conservation into your homes and your lives at a cost you can afford . I ask Congress to give me authority for mandatory conservation and for standby gasoline rationing . To further conserve energy , I am proposing tonight an extra 10 billion over the next decade to strengthen our public transportation systems . And I am asking you for your good and for your Nation s security to take no unnecessary trips , to use carpools or public transportation whenever you can , to park your car one extra day per week , to obey the speed limit , and to set your thermostats to save fuel . Every act of energy conservation like this is more than just common sense I tell you it is an act of patriotism . Our Nation must be fair to the poorest among us , so we will increase aid to needy Americans to cope with rising energy prices . We often think of conservation only in terms of sacrifice . In fact , it is the most painless and immediate way of rebuilding our Nation s strength . Every gallon of oil each one of us saves is a new form of production . It gives us more freedom , more confidence , that much more control over our own lives . So , the solution of our energy crisis can also help us to conquer the crisis of the spirit in our country . It can rekindle our sense of unity , our confidence in the future , and give our Nation and all of us individually a new sense of purpose . You know we can do it . We have the natural resources . We have more oil in our shale alone than several Saudi Arabias . We have more coal than any nation on Earth . We have the world s highest level of technology . We have the most skilled work force , with innovative genius , and I firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war . I do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy . I do not promise a quick way out of our Nation s problems , when the truth is that the only way out is an all out effort . What I do promise you is that I will lead our fight , and I will enforce fairness in our struggle , and I will ensure honesty . And above all , I will act . We can manage the short term shortages more effectively and we will , but there are no short term solutions to our long range problems . There is simply no way to avoid sacrifice . Twelve hours from now I will speak again in Kansas City , to expand and to explain further our energy program . Just as the search for solutions to our energy shortages has now led us to a new awareness of our Nation s deeper problems , so our willingness to work for those solutions in energy can strengthen us to attack those deeper problems . I will continue to travel this country , to hear the people of America . You can help me to develop a national agenda for the 1980s . I will listen and I will act . We will act together . These were the promises I made 3 years ago , and I intend to keep them . Little by little we can and we must rebuild our confidence . We can spend until we empty our treasuries , and we may summon all the wonders of science . But we can succeed only if we tap our greatest resources America s people , America s values , and America s confidence . I have seen the strength of America in the inexhaustible resources of our people . In the days to come , let us renew that strength in the struggle for an energy secure nation . In closing , let me say this I will do my best , but I will not do it alone . Let your voice be heard . Whenever you have a chance , say something good about our country . With God s help and for the sake of our Nation , it is time for us to join hands in America . Let us commit ourselves together to a rebirth of the American spirit . Working together with our common faith we cannot fail . Thank you and good night .<speech_sep>Good evening . I would like to read a joint Communiqu eacute which is being simultaneously issued in Peking at this very moment by the leaders of the People s Republic of China The United States of America and the People s Republic of China have agreed to recognize each other and to establish diplomatic relations as of January 1 , 1979 . The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China . Within this context , the people of the United States will maintain cultural , commercial , and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan . The United States of America and the People s Republic of China reaffirm the principles agreed on by the two sides in the Shanghai Communiqu eacute and emphasize once again that Both wish to reduce the danger of international military conflict . Neither should seek hegemony in the Asia Pacific region or in any other region of the world and each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony . Neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of any third party or to enter into agreements or understandings with the other directed at other states . The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China . Both believe that normalization of Sino American relations is not only in the interest of the Chinese and American peoples but also contributes to the cause of peace in Asia and the world . The United States of America and the people s Republic of China will exchange Ambassadors and establish Embassies on March 1 , 1979 . Yesterday , our country and the People s Republic of China reached this final historic agreement . On January 1 , 1979 , a little more than two weeks from now , our two Governments will implement full normalization of diplomatic relations . As a nation of gifted people who comprise about one fourth of the total population of the Earth , China plays , already , an important role in world affairs , a role that can only grow more important in the years ahead . We do not undertake this important step for transient tactical or expedient reasons . In recognizing the People s Republic of China , that it is the single Government of China , we are recognizing simple reality . But far more is involved in this decision than just the recognition of a fact . Before the estrangement of recent decades , the American and the Chinese people had a long history of friendship . We have already begun to rebuild some of those previous ties . Now our rapidly expanding relationship requires the kind of structure that only full diplomatic relations will make possible . The change that I am announcing tonight will be of great long term benefit to the peoples of both our country and China and , I believe , to all the peoples of the world . Normalization and the expanded commercial and cultural relations that it will bring will contribute to the well being of our own Nation , to our own national interest , and it will also enhance the stability of Asia . These more positive relations with China can beneficially affect the world in which we live and the world in which our children will live . We have already begun to inform our allies and other nations and the Members of the Congress of the details of our intended action . But I wish also tonight to convey a special message to the people of Taiwan I have already communicated with the leaders in Taiwan with whom the American people have had and will have extensive , close , and friendly relations . This is important between our two peoples . As the United States asserted in the Shanghai Communiqu eacute of 1972 , issued on President Nixon s historic visit , we will continue to have an interest in the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue . I have paid special attention to ensuring that normalization of relations between our country and the People s Republic will not jeopardize the well being of the people of Taiwan . The people of our country will maintain our current commercial , cultural , trade , and other relations with Taiwan through nongovernmental means . Many other countries in the world are already successfully doing this . These decisions and these actions open a new and important chapter in our country s history and also in world affairs . To strengthen and to expedite the benefits of this new relationship between China and the United States , I am pleased to announce that Vice Premier Teng has accepted my invitation and will visit Washington at the end of January . His visit will give our Governments the opportunity to consult with each other on global issues and to begin working together to enhance the cause of world peace . These events are the final result of long and serious negotiations begun by President Nixon in 1972 , and continued under the leadership of President Ford . The results bear witness to the steady , determined , bipartisan effort of our own country to build a world in which peace will be the goal and the responsibility of all nations . The normalization of relations between the United States and China has no other purpose than this the advancement of peace . It is in this spirit , at this season of peace , that I take special pride in sharing this good news with you tonight . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Good evening . I want to have a frank talk with you tonight about our most serious domestic problem . That problem is inflation . Inflation can threaten all the economic gains we have made , and it can stand in the way of what we want to achieve in the future . This has been a long time threat . For the last 10 years , the annual inflation rate in the United States has averaged 6 1 2 percent . And during the 3 years before my Inauguration , it had increased to an average of 8 percent . Inflation has , therefore , been a serious problem for me ever since I became President . We have tried to control it , but we have not been successful . It is time for all of us to make a greater and a more coordinated effort . If inflation gets worse , several things will happen . Your purchasing power will continue to decline , and most of the burden will fall on those who can least afford it . Our national productivity will suffer . The value of our dollar will continue to fall in world trade . We have made good progress in putting our people back to work over the past 21 months . We have created more than 6 million new jobs for American workers . We have reduced the unemployment rate by about 25 percent , and we will continue our efforts to reduce unemployment further , especially among our young people and minorities . But I must tell you tonight that inflation threatens this progress . If we do not get inflation under control , we will not be able to reduce unemployment further , and we may even slide backward . Inflation is obviously a serious problem . What is the solution I do not have all the answers . Nobody does . Perhaps there is no complete and adequate answer . But I want to let you know that fighting inflation will be a central preoccupation of mine during the months ahead , and I want to arouse our Nation to join me in this effort . There are two simplistic and familiar answers which are sometimes proposed simple , familiar , and too extreme . One of these answers is to impose a complicated scheme of Federal Government wage and price controls on our entire free economic system . The other is a deliberate recession , which would throw millions of people out of work . Both of these extreme proposals would not work , and they must be rejected . I have spent many hours in the last few months reviewing , with my own advisers and with a number of outside experts , every proposal , every suggestion , every possibility for eliminating inflation . If there is one thing I have learned beyond any doubt , it is that there is no single solution for inflation . What we have , instead , is a number of partial remedies . Some of them will help others may not . But we have no choice but to use the best approaches we have and to maintain a constant search for additional steps which may be effective . I want to discuss with you tonight some of the approaches we have been able to develop . They involve action by Government , business , labor , and every other sector of our economy . Some of these factors are under my control as President especially Government actions and I will insist that the Government does its part of the job . But whether our efforts are successful will finally depend on you as much as on me . Your decisions made every day at your service station or your grocery store , in your business , in your union meetings will determine our Nation s answer to inflation as much as decisions made here in the White House or by the Congress on Capitol Hill . I cannot guarantee that our joint effort will succeed . In fact , it is almost certain not to succeed if success means quick or dramatic changes . Every free government on Earth is wrestling with this problem of inflation , and every one of them knows that a long term disease requires longterm treatment . It is up to us to make the improvements we can , even at the risk of partial failure , rather than to ensure failure by not trying at all . I will concentrate my efforts within the Government . We know that Government is not the only cause of inflation . But it is one of the causes , and Government does set an example . Therefore , it must take the lead in fiscal restraint . We are going to hold down Government spending , reduce the budget deficit , and eliminate Government waste . We will slash Federal hiring and cut the Federal work force . We will eliminate needless regulations . We will bring more competition back to our economy . And we will oppose any further reduction in Federal income taxes until we have convincing prospects that inflation will be controlled . Let me explain what each one of these steps means . The Federal deficit is too high . Our people are simply sick and tired of wasteful Federal spending and the inflation it brings with it . We have already had some success . We have brought the deficit down by one third since I ran for President from more than 66 billion in fiscal year 1976 to about 40 billion in fiscal year 1979 a reduction of more than 25 billion in the Federal deficit in just 3 years . It will keep going down . Next year , with tough restraints on Federal spending and moderate economic growth in prospect , I plan to reduce the budget deficit to less than one half what it was when I ran for office to 30 billion or less . The Government has been spending too great a portion of what our Nation produces . During my campaign I promised to cut the Government s share of our total national spending from 23 percent , which it was then , to 21 percent in fiscal year 1981 . We now plan to meet that goal 1 year earlier . Reducing the deficit will require difficult and unpleasant decisions . We must face a time of national austerity . Hard choices are necessary if we want to avoid consequences that are even worse . I intend to make those hard choices . I have already vetoed bills that would undermine our fight against inflation , and the Congress has sustained those vetoes . I know that the Congress will continue to cooperate in the effort to meet our needs in responsible , noninflationary ways . I will use the administrative and the budgetary powers of my office , including the veto , if necessary , to keep our Nation firmly on the path of fiscal restraint . Restraint involves tax policy as well as spending decisions . Tax reduction has never been more politically popular than it is today . But if future tax cuts are made rashly , with no eye on the budget deficits , they will hurt us all by causing more inflation . There are tax cuts which could directly lower costs and prices and help in the fight against inflation . I may consider ways to reduce those particular taxes while still cutting the budget deficit , but until we have a convincing prospect of controlling inflation , I will oppose any further reductions in Federal income taxes . To keep the Government to a manageable size , I am ordering tonight a cut in Federal hiring . This order will mean a reduction of more than 20 , 000 in the number of permanent Federal employees already budgeted for this fiscal year and will cut the total size of the Federal work force . I have already placed a 5 percent cap on the pay increase for Federal employees , and Federal executive officers are receiving no pay increases at all . It is not enough just to control Government deficits , spending , and hiring . We must also control the costs of Government regulations . In recent years , Congress has passed a number of landmark statutes to improve social and environmental conditions . We must and we will continue progress toward protecting the health and safety of the American people . But we must also realize that everything has a price and that consumers eventually pick up the tab . Where regulations are essential , they must be efficient . Where they fight inflation , they should be encouraged . Where they are unnecessary , they should be removed . Early this year , I directed Federal agencies to eliminate unnecessary regulations and to analyze the costs and benefits of new ones . Today , for instance , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , sometimes called OSHeliminated nearly 1 , 000 unnecessary regulations . Now , we can build on this progress . I have directed a council of my regulatory departments and agencies to coordinate their regulations , to prevent overlapping and duplication . Most important , the council will develop a unified calendar of planned major regulations . The calendar will give us , for the first time , a comprehensive list of regulations the Federal Government is proposing , with their costs and objectives . As President , I will personally use my authority to ensure that regulations are issued only when needed and that they meet their goals at the lowest possible cost . We are also cutting away the regulatory thicket that has grown up around us and giving our competitive free enterprise system a chance to grow up in its place . Last year we gave the airline industry a fresh shot of competition . Regulations were removed . Free market forces drove prices down , record numbers of passengers traveled , and profits went up . Our new airline deregulation bill will make these benefits permanent . For the first time in decades , we have actually deregulated a major industry . Next year we will work with Congress to bring more competition to others , such as the railroad and trucking industries . Of all our weapons against inflation , competition is the most powerful . Without real competition , prices and wages go up , even when demand is going down . We must therefore work to allow more competition wherever possible so that powerful groups government , business , labor must think twice before abusing their economic power . We will redouble our efforts to put competition back into the American free enterprise system . Another reason for inflation is the slowdown in productivity growth . More efficient production is essential if we are to control inflation , make American goods more competitive in world markets , add new jobs , and increase the real incomes of our people . We have made a start toward improving productivity . The tax bill just passed by the Congress includes many of the investment incentives that I recommended last January . Federal support for research and development will continue to increase , especially for basic research . We will coordinate and strengthen Federal programs that support productivity improvements throughout our economy . Our Government efforts will attack the inflation that hurts most , inflation in the essentials food , housing , and medical care . We will continue to use our agricultural policies to sustain farm production , to maintain stable prices , and to keep inflation down . Rising interest rates have always accompanied inflation . They add further to the costs of business expansion and to what consumers must pay when they buy houses and other consumer items . The burden of controlling inflation cannot be left to monetary policy alone , which must deal with the problem through tight restrictions on money and credit that push interest rates up . I will work for a balanced , concerted , and sustained program under which tight budget restraint , private wage and price moderation , and responsible monetary policy support each other . If successful , we should expect lower inflation and lower interest rates for consumers and businesses alike . As for medical care , where costs have gone up much faster than the general inflation rate , the most important step we can take is to pass a strong bill to control hospital costs . This year the Senate passed one . Next year I will try again , and I believe the whole Congress will act to hold down hospital costs if your own Members of Congress hear from you . Between now and January , when the new Congress convenes , I will be preparing a package of specific legislative proposals to help fight inflation . The Government will do its part , but in a country like ours , Government cannot do the job alone . In the end , the success or failure of this effort will also rest on whether the private sector will accept and act on the voluntary wage and price standards I am announcing tonight . These standards are fair . They are standards that everyone can follow . If we do follow them , they will slow prices down so that wages will not have to chase prices just to stay even . And they point the way toward an eventual cure for inflation , by removing the pressures that cause it in the first place . In the last 10 years , in our attempts to protect ourselves from inflation we have developed attitudes and habits that actually keep inflation going once it has begun . Most companies raise their prices because they expect costs to rise . Unions call for large wage settlements because they expect inflation to continue . Because we expect it to happen , it does happen and once it is started , wages and prices chase each other up and up . It is like a crowd standing at a football stadium . No one can see any better than when everyone is sitting down , but no one is willing to be the first to sit down . Except for our lowest paid workers , I am asking all employees in this country to limit total wage increases to a maximum of 7 percent per year . From tonight on , every contract signed and every pay raise granted should meet this standard . My price limitation will be equally strict . Our basic target for economy wide price increases is 5 3 4 percent . To reach this goal , I am tonight setting a standard for each firm in the Nation to hold its price increases at least one half of one percentage point below what they averaged during 1976 and 1977 . Of course , we have to take into account binding commitments already in effect , which will prevent an absolute adherence to these standards . But this price standard is much lower than this year s inflation rate , and more important , it is less than the standard for wage increases . That difference is accounted for by rising productivity , and it will allow the income of America s workers to stay ahead of inflation . This is a standard for everyone to follow everyone . As far as I am concerned , every business , every union , every professional group , every individual in this country has no excuse not to adhere to these standards . If we meet these standards , the real buying power of your paycheck will rise . The difficulty with a voluntary program is that workers fear that if they cooperate with the standards while others do not , then they will suffer if inflation continues . To deal with this concern , I will ask the Congress next January to enact a program that workers who observe the standards would be eligible for a tax rebate if the inflation rate is more than 7 percent . In other words , they would have a real wage insurance policy against inflation which might be caused by others . This will give our workers an additional incentive to observe the program and will remove their only legitimate reason not to cooperate . Because this is not a mandatory control plan , I cannot stop an irresponsible corporation from raising its prices or a selfish group of employees from using its power to demand excessive wages . But then if that happens , the Government will respond , using the tools of Government authority and public opinion . Soon after they raise prices or demand pay increases that are excessive , the company or the union will feel the pressure that the public can exert , through new competition to drive prices down or removal of Government protections and privileges which they now enjoy . We will also make better use of the 80 billion worth of purchases the Government makes from private industry each year . We must be prudent buyers . If costs rise too fast , we can delay those purchases , as your family would , or switch to another supplier . We may not buy a fleet of cars this year , for example , if cars cost too much , or we may channel our purchases to suppliers who have observed our wage and price standards rather than to buy from those who have not . We will require firms that supply goods and services to the Government to certify their compliance with the wage and price standards . We will make every effort , within legal limits , to deny Government contracts to companies that fail to meet our wage and price standards . We will use our buying power more effectively to make price restraint and competition a reality . The Government now extends economic privileges to many parts of the private economy special franchises , protected wages and prices , subsidies , protection from foreign competition . If wages or prices rise too fast in some industry , we will take that as a sign that those privileges are no longer needed and that this protection should be removed . We will make sure that no part of our economy is able to use its special privilege or its concentrated power to victimize the rest of us . This approach I have outlined will not end inflation . It simply improves our chances of making it better rather than worse . To summarize the plan I am announcing tonight We will cut the budget deficit . We will slash Federal hiring and reduce the Federal work force . We will restrain Federal pay . We will delay further tax cuts . We will remove needless regulations . We will use Federal policy to encourage more competition . We will set specific standards for both wages and prices throughout the economy . We will use all the powers at our disposal to make this program work . And we will submit new anti inflation proposals to the Congress next January , including the real wage insurance proposal I have discussed tonight . I have said many times that these steps will be tough and they are . But I also said they will be fair and they are . They apply equally to all groups . They give all of us an equal chance to move ahead . And these proposals , which give us a chance , also deserve a chance . If , tomorrow or next week or next month , you ridicule them , ignore them , pick them apart before they have a chance to work , then you will have reduced their chance of succeeding . These steps can work , but that will take time , and you are the ones who can give them that time . If there is one thing I am asking of every American tonight , it is to give this plan a chance to work a chance to work for us . You can help give it that chance by using your influence . Business and labor must know that you will not tolerate irresponsible price and wage increases . Your elected officials must know how you feel as they make difficult choices . Too often the only voices they hear are those of special interests , supporting their own narrow cause . If you want Government officials to cut inflation , you have to make sure that they hear your voice . I have heard you with unmistakable clarity . Nearly 40 years ago , when the world watched to see whether his nation would survive , Winston Churchill defied those who thought Britain would fall to the Nazi threat . Churchill replied by asking his countrymen , What kind of people do they think we are There are those today who say that a free economy cannot cope with inflation and that we have lost our ability to act as a nation rather than as a collection of special interests . And I reply , What kind of people do they think we are I believe that our people , our economic system , and our Government are equal to this task . I hope that you will prove me right . Thank you , and good night .<speech_sep>Yes . First of all it is to recognize the tremendous economic strength of this country and to set the putting back to work of our people as a top priority . This is an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House , the inspiration of our people , the tapping of business , agriculture , industry , labor , and government at all levels to work on this project . We will never have an end to the inflationary spiral , and we will never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work . There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done first of all , to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide large numbers of jobs secondly , we need to have a commitment in the private sector to cooperate with government in matters like housing . Here , a very small investment of taxpayers money in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs , in the guarantee of mortgage loans , in the putting forward of 202 programs for housing for older people and so forth , to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the construction industry . Another thing is to deal with our needs in the central cities where the unemployment rate is extremely high sometimes among minority groups , those who do not speak English or who are black or young people a 40 percent unemployment . Here , a CCC type program would be appropriate , to channel money into the sharing with private sector and also local and State governments to employ young people who are now out of work . Another very important aspect of our economy would be to increase production in every way possible , to hold down taxes on individuals , and to shift the tax burdens on to those who have avoided paying taxes in the past . These kinds of specific things , none of which are being done now , would be a great help in reducing unemployment . There is an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very succinctly , and that is to make sure that we have a good relationship between management , business on the one hand and labor on the other . In a lot of places where unemployment is very high , we might channel specific , targeted job opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people and also sharing with local governments the payment of salaries , which would let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower before we hit the inflationary level . But I believe that by the end of the first 4 years of the next term , we could have the unemployment rate down to 3 percent adult unemployment which is about 4 to 4 percent overall , a controlled inflation rate , and have a balanced growth of about 4 to 6 percent , around 5 percent , which would give us a balanced budget . Well , we now have such a low utilization of our productive capacity , about 73 percent I think it is about the lowest since the Great Depression years and such a high unemployment rate now 7 . 9 percent that we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures . And I think this would be easy to accomplish , to get jobs now without having the strong inflationary pressures that would be necessary . I would not favor the payment of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work . But with tax incentives for the low income groups , we could build up their income levels above the poverty level and not make welfare more profitable than work . Well , Ford is changing considerably his previous philosophy . The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country . It is just a welfare program for the rich . As a matter of fact , 25 percent of the total tax deductions go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country , and over 50 percent of the tax credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country . When Ford first became President in August of 1974 , the first thing he did in October was to ask for a 4 . 7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession since the Great Depression of the 1940 s . In January of 1975 , he asked for a tax change , a 5 . 6 billion increase on low and middle income private individuals , a 6 1 2 billion decrease on the corporations and the special interests . In December of 1975 , he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion tax reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress . And then he came back later on in January of this year , and he did advocate a 10 billion tax reduction , but it would be offset by a 6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for social security payments and for unemployment compensation . The whole philosophy of the Republican Party , including my opponent , has been to pile on taxes on low income people , to take them off on the corporations . As a matter of fact , since the late sixties when Nixon took office , we have had a reduction in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent . We have had an increase in taxes paid by individuals , payroll taxes , from 14 percent up to 20 percent . This is what the Republicans have done to us . This is why tax reform is so important . Well , as a matter of fact , there is . If we assume a rate of growth of our economy equivalent to what it was during President Johnson and President Kennedy , even before the Vietnamese war , and if we assume that , at the end of the 4 year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 percent . Under those circumstances , even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the allotment of money to finance programs increasing as the inflation rate does , my economic projects , I think confirmed by the House and the Senate committees , have been , with a 60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year 81 which would be the last year of this next term within that 60 billion increase , there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people . I might say , too , that if we see that these goals cannot be reached and I believe they are reasonable goals then I would cut back on the rate of implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 , which is the last year of the next term . I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances . And these projections have been very carefully made . I stand behind them . And if they should be in error slightly on the down side , then I will phase in the programs that we have advocated more slowly . DREGovernor , according to the budget committees of the Congress that you referred to , if we get to full employment , what they project at a 4 percent unemployment and , as you say , even allowing for the inflation in the programs , there would not be anything more than a surplus of 5 billion by 1981 . Conservative estimates of your programs would be that they had be about 85 to 100 billion . So , how do you say that you are going to be able to do these things and balance the budget Well , the assumption that you have described that is different is in the rate of growth of our economy . I believe that it is accurate to say that the committees to whom you refer , with the employment rate that you state and with the 5 to 5 1 2 percent growth rate in our economy , that the projections would be a 60 billion increase in the amount of money that we have to spend in 1981 compared to now . And in that framework would be fit any improvements in the programs . Now , this does not include any extra control over unnecessary spending , the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs . We will have a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of Government , which I am pledged to do . The present bureaucratic structure of the Federal Government is a mess . And if I am elected President , that is going to be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the Federal Government to make it economical , efficient , purposeful , and manageable for a change . And also , I am going to institute zero base budgeting , which I used 4 years in Georgia , which assesses every program every year and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent . But with these projections we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981 if I am elected President , keep my promises to the American people . And it is just predicated on very modest , but I think accurate , projections of employment increases and a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy , Johnson , before the Vietnam war . Well , I think it is very difficult for President Ford to explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws . As a matter of fact now , I do not advocate amnesty I advocate pardon . There is a difference , in my opinion , and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and in accordance with the definition in the dictionary . Amnesty means that what you did was right . Pardon means that what you did , whether it is right or wrong , you are forgiven for it . And I do advocate a pardon for draft evaders . I think it is accurate to say that 2 years ago , when Ford put in this amnesty , that three times as many deserters were excused as were the ones who evaded the draft . But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam war . And I think that what the people are concerned about is not the pardon or the amnesty of those who evaded the draft , but whether or not our crime system is fair . We have got a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime . The big shots who are rich , who are influential , very seldom go to jail . Those who are poor and who have no influence quite often are the ones who are punished . And the whole subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much . And I believe that the fairness of it is what is the major problem that addresses our leader , and this is something that has not been addressed adequately by this administration . But I hope to have a complete responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a fair criminal justice system and also to bring about an end to the divisiveness that has occurred in our country as a result of the Vietnam war . Well , I have been through this before , Gannon , as the Governor of Georgia . When I took over we had a bureaucratic mess like we have in Washington now . And we had 300 agencies , departments , bureaus , commissions some fully budgeted , some not but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict . And we cut those 300 agencies and so forth down substantially we eliminated 278 of them . We set up a simple structure of government that could be administered fairly , and it was a tremendous success . It has not been undone since I was there . It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system , our prison system , our education system , our mental health programs , and a clear assignment of responsibility and authority , and also to have our people once again understand and control our Government . I intend to do the same thing if I am elected President . When I get to Washington , coming in as an outsider , one of the major responsibilities that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the executive branch of Government . We now have a greatly expanded White House staff . When Nixon went in office , for instance , we had 3 1 2 million spent on the White House and its staff . That has escalated now to 16 million in the last Republican administration . This needs to be changed . We need to put the responsibilities back on the Cabinet members . We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs . For instance , we now have in the health area 302 different programs administered by 11 major departments and agencies . Sixty other advisory commissions are responsible for this . Medicaid is in one agency Medicare is in a different one the check on the quality of health care is in a different one . None of them are responsible for health care itself . This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program . We have just advocated this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy . Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy . We have 20 different agencies in the Federal Government responsible for the production , the regulation , the information about energy , the conservation of energy spread all over Government . This is a gross waste of money . So , tough , competent management of Government , giving us a simple , efficient , purposeful , and manageable Government will be a great step forward . And if I am elected and I intend to be then it is going to be done . I cannot say for sure that we would have fewer Federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in . It took me about 3 years to completely reorganize the Georgia government . The last year I was in office our budget was actually less than it was a year before , which showed a great improvement . Also , we had a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year , but it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services . For instance , we completely revised our prison system . We established 84 new mental health treatment centers , and we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services . The same thing will be done at the Federal Government level . I accomplished this with substantial reductions in employees in some departments . For instance , in the Transportation Department we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees . In giving our people better mental health care , we increased the number of employees . But the efficiency of it , the simplicity of it , the ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization . We have got to do this at the Federal Government level . If we do not , the bureaucratic mess is going to continue . There is no way for our people now to understand what their Government is there is no way to get the answer to a question . When you come to Washington to try to as a Governor to try to begin a new program for your people , like the treatment of drug addicts , I found there were 13 different Federal agencies that I had to go to to manage the drug treatment program . In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment . This is the kind of change that would be made . And it would be of tremendous benefit in long range planning , in tight budgeting , saving the taxpayers money , making the Government more efficient , cutting down on bureaucratic waste , having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees , and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their Government . Well , Ford takes the same attitude that the Republicans always take . In the last 3 months before an election , they are always for the programs that they fight the other 3 1 2 years . I remember when Herbert Hoover was against jobs for people . I remember when All Landon was against social security . And later President Nixon 16 years ago was telling the public that John Kennedy s proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost . The best thing to do is to look at the record of Ford s administration and Nixon s before his . We had last year a 65 billion deficit , the largest deficit in the history of our country , more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire 8 year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy . We have got 500 , 000 more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work 3 months ago . And since Ford has been in office , in 2 years we have had a 50 percent increase in unemployment , from 5 million people out of work to 2 1 2 million more people out of work , or a total of 7 1 2 million . We have also got a comparison between himself and Nixon . He is got four times the size of the deficits that Nixon even had himself . This talking about more people at work is distorted because with the 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last 2 years , it means that women and young people have had to go to work when they did not want to because their fathers could not make enough to pay the increased cost of food and housing and clothing . We have , in this last 2 years alone , 120 billion total deficits under President Ford , and at the same time we have had in the last 8 years a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business . We have had a negative growth in our national economy , measured in real dollars . The take home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 , measured in real dollars . This is the kind of record that is there , and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Ford at the last minute is one that just does not go . Well , among my other experiences in the past I have been a nuclear engineer , and I did graduate work in this field . I think I know the capabilities and limitations of atomic power . But the energy policy of our Nation is one that has not yet been established under this administration . I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us . We have seen the Federal Energy Agency established , for instance , in the crisis of 1973 . It was supposed to be a temporary agency now it is permanent . It is enormous it is growing every day . And I think the Wall Street Journal reported not too long ago they have 112 public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence . We have got to have a firm way to handle the energy question . The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one first step . In addition to that , we need to have a realization that we have got about 35 years worth of oil left in the whole world . We are going to run out of oil . When Nixon made his famous speech on operation independence , we were importing about 35 percent of our oil . Now we have increased that amount 25 percent . We now import about 44 percent of our oil . We need a shift from oil to coal . We need to concentrate our research and development effort on coal burning and extraction that is safe for miners , that also is clean burning . We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures and then , as a last resort only , continue to use atomic power . I would certainly not cut out atomic power altogether . We cannot afford to give up that opportunity until later . But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power , I would be responsible as President to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained . For instance , some that have been forgotten We need to have the reactor core below ground level , the entire powerplant that uses atomic power tightly sealed , and a heavy vacuum maintained . There ought to be a standardized design . There ought to be a full time atomic energy specialist , independent of the power company , in the control room full time , 24 hours a day , to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops . These kinds of procedures , along with evacuation procedures , adequate insurance , ought to be initiated . So , shift from oil to coal emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power strict conservation measures not yield every time the special interest groups put pressure on The President , like this administration has done and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions . That is the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it . Yes , I would . Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies . We now encourage people to waste electricity by giving the lowest rates to the biggest users . We do not do anything to cut down on peak load requirements . We do not have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes , for the efficiency of automobiles . And whenever the automobile manufacturers come forward and say they cannot meet the limits that the Congress has put forward , this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates . In addition to that , we ought to have a shift to the use of coal , particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located a lot of very high quality , low carbon coal I mean low sulfur coal is there it is where our employment is needed . This would help a great deal . So , mandatory conservation measures , yes . Encouragement by The President for people to voluntarily conserve , yes . And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency . One bank in Washington , for instance , gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles . And some major manufacturing companies , like Dow Chemical , have , through very effective efficiency mechanisms , cut down the use of energy by as much as 40 percent with the same out product . These kind of things ought to be done they ought to be encouraged and supported and even required by the Government , yes . very substantially to ensure that our nuclear power plants are safer , that they are more efficient , and that we have adequate safeguards . I think you have to have greater oil and gas production , more coal production , more nuclear production , and in addition , you have to have energy conservation . Well , Ford does not seem to put into perspective the fact that when 500 , 000 more people are out of work then there were 3 months ago , where we have 2 million more people out of work than were when he took office , that this touches human beings . I was in a city in Pennsylvania not too long ago near here , and there were about 4 , 000 or 5 , 000 people in the audience it was on a train trip and I said , How many adults here are out of work About a thousand raised their hands . Ford actually has fewer people now in the private sector in nonfarm jobs than when he took office , and still he talks about a success 7 . 9 percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country . He says he has learned how to match unemployment with inflation . That is right . We have got the highest inflation we have had in 25 years right now except under this administration and that was 50 years ago and we have got the highest unemployment we have had under Ford s administration since the Great Depression . This affects human beings . And his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration and not a work administration . He has not saved 9 billion with his vetoes . It has only been a net saving of 4 billion . And the cost in unemployment compensation , welfare compensation , and lost revenues has increased 23 billion in the last 2 years . This is a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people s lives . And then it is covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation . It is a travesty . It shows a lack of leadership . And we have never had a President since the War Between the States that vetoed more bills . Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Nixon , per year , and 11 of them have been overridden . One of his bills that was overridden he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House from Republicans . So , this shows a breakdown in leadership . Right . Now we have such a grossly unbalanced tax system , as I said earlier , that it is a disgrace . Of all the tax benefits now , 25 percent of them go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country . Over 50 percent 53 to be exact percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country . We have had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Nixon went in office 8 years ago . Ford has advocated , since he has been in office , over 5 billion in reductions for corporations , special interest groups , and the very , very wealthy , who derive their income not from labor , but from investments . That has got to be changed . A few things that can be done We have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations , who invest overseas , if they make 1 million in profits overseas , they do not have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country . Where they do not pay their taxes , the average American pays their taxes for them . Not only that but it robs this country of jobs because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory , say , in New Hampshire or Vermont , if the company takes the money down to Italy and builds a shoe factory , they do not have to pay any taxes on the money . Another thing is a system called DISC Domestic International Sales Corporation , which was originally designed and proposed by Nixon , to encourage exports . This permits a company to create a dummy corporation to export their products and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them . This costs our Government about 1 . 4 billion a year , and when those rich corporations do not pay that tax , the average American taxpayer pays it for them . Another one that is very important is the business deductions . Jet airplanes , first class travel , the 50 martini lunch the average working person cannot take advantage of that , but the wealthier people can . Another system is where a dentist can invest money in , say , raising cattle and can put in 100 , 000 of his own money , borrow 900 , 000 900 , 000 , that makes a million and mark off a great amount of loss through that procedure . There was one example , for instance , where somebody produced pornographic movies . They put in 30 , 000 of their own money and got 120 , 000 in tax savings . These special kinds of programs have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful and who can employ lobbyists and who can have their A . s and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly 8 , 000 pages of the tax code . The average American person cannot do it . You cannot hire a lobbyist out of unemployment compensation checks . No , I would not do away with all business deductions . I think that would be a very serious mistake . But if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair , you could lower taxes for everyone . I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living or who are presently required to list all their income . What I want to do is not to raise taxes , but to eliminate loopholes . And this is the point of my first statistic that I gave you , that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years 50 years by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists , have benefited just the rich . These programs that I described to you earlier the tax deferrals for overseas , the DISand the tax shelters they only apply to people in the 50 , 000 a year bracket or up . And I think this is the best way to approach it , is to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower and middle income families . Well , it is not a matter of Republican and Democrat it is a matter of leadership or no leadership . President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well . Even President Nixon , because he was a strong leader , at least , worked with a Democratic Congress very well . Ford has vetoed , as I said earlier , four times as many bills per year as Nixon . Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress . I think under President Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation . This year Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward . This is government by stalemate . And we have seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between The President , who represents this country , and the Congress , who , collectively , also represent this country . We have had Republican Presidents before who have tried to run against a Democratic Congress . And I do not think it is the Congress is Ford s opponent . But if he insists that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress , of which I have not been a part , then I think it is only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety , of which he was a part . That , I think , is a good balance . But the point is that a President ought to lead this country . Ford , so far as I know , except for avoiding another Watergate , has not accomplished one single major program for his country . And there has been a constant squabbling between The President and the Congress , and that is not the way this country ought to be run . I might go back to one other thing . Ford has misquoted an AP news story that was in error to begin with . That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for lower and middle income families , and that correction was delivered to the White House . And I am sure that The President knows about this correction , but he still insists on repeating an erroneous statement . What I have said is that The President ought to have a chance to appoint the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminus term in other words , both of them serve the same 4 years . The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income tax laws . The President can modify the economic structure of the country by public statements and general attitudes and the budget that he proposes . The Federal Reserve has an independent status that ought to be preserved . I think that Burns did take a typical erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high . He assumed that the inflation rate was because of excessive demand and , therefore , put into effect tight constraint on the economy , very high interest rates which is typical , also , of a Republican administration tried to increase the tax payments by individuals , cut the tax payments by corporations . I would have done it opposite . I think the problem should have been addressed by increasing productivity , by having put people back to work so they could purchase more goods , lower income taxes on individuals , perhaps raise them if necessary on corporations in comparison . But Burns in that respect made a very serious mistake . I would not want to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve Board . But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at least the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and The President s terms being the same and letting the Congress of course be the third entity with independence , subject only to The President s veto . Well , one of the very serious things that is happened in our Government in recent years and has continued up until now is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the There has been too much Government secrecy and not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens . Well , tonight , we have bad a chance to talk a lot about the past , but I think it is time to talk about the future . Our Nation in the last 8 years has been divided as never before . It is a time for unity . It is time to draw ourselves together , to have a President and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change , cooperating for a change , in the open for a change , so the people can understand their own Government . It is time for Government , industry and labor , manufacturing , agriculture , education , other entities in our society to cooperate . And it is a time for Government to understand and to cooperate with our people . For a long time our American citizens have been excluded , sometimes misled , sometimes have been lied to . This is not compatible with the purpose of our Nation . I believe in our country . It needs to be competent , the Government needs to be well managed , efficient , economical . We need to have a Government that is sensitive to our people s needs , to those who are poor , who do not have adequate health care , who have been cheated too long by our tax programs , who have been out of jobs , whose families have been torn apart . We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own Government . In addition to that , we have suffered because we have not had leadership in this administration . We have got a Government of stalemate . We have lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be . This is not the America that we have known in the past . It is not the America that we have to have in the future . I do not claim to know all the answers , but I have got confidence in my country . Our economic strength is still there . Our system of government , in spite of Vietnam , Cambodia , CIWatergate , is still the best system of government on Earth . And the greatest resource of all are the 215 million Americans who still have within us the strength , the character , the intelligence , the experience , the patriotism , the idealism , the compassion , the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country . We ought not to be excluded from our Government anymore . We need a President that can go in who derives his strength from the people . I owe the special interests nothing . I owe everything to you , the people of this country . And I believe that we can bind our wounds . I believe that we can work together . And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country , that we can once again have a Government as good as our people and let the world know what we still know and hope for that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on Earth .<speech_sep>I come to you this evening to discuss the extremely important and rapidly changing circumstances in Southwest Asia . I continue to share with all of you the sense of outrage and impatience because of the kidnaping of innocent American hostages and the holding of them by militant terrorists with the support and the approval of Iranian officials . Our purposes continue to be the protection of the longrange interests of our Nation and the safety of the American hostages . We are attempting to secure the release of the Americans through the International Court of Justice , through the United Nations , and through public and private diplomatic efforts . We are determined to achieve this goal . We hope to do so without bloodshed and without any further danger to the lives of our 50 fellow Americans . In these efforts , we continue to have the strong support of the world community . The unity and the common sense of the American people under such trying circumstances are essential to the success of our efforts . Recently , there has been another very serious development which threatens the maintenance of the peace in Southwest Asia . Massive Soviet military forces have invaded the small , nonaligned , sovereign nation of Afghanistan . , which had hitherto not been an occupied satellite of the Soviet Union . Fifty thousand heavily armed Soviet troops have crossed the border and are now dispersed throughout Afghanistan , attempting to conquer the fiercely independent Muslim people of that country . The Soviets claim , falsely , that they were invited into Afghanistan to help protect that country from some unnamed outside threat . But the President , who had been the leader of Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion , was assassinated along with several members of his family after the Soviets gained control of the capital city of Kabul . Only several days later was the new puppet leader even brought into Afghanistan by the Soviets . This invasion is an extremely serious threat to peace because of the threat of further Soviet expansion into neighboring countries in Southwest Asia and also because such an aggressive military policy is unsettling to other peoples throughout the world . This is a callous violation of international law and the United Nations Charter . It is a deliberate effort of a powerful atheistic government to subjugate an independent Islamic people . We must recognize the strategic importance of Afghanistan to stability and peace . A Soviet occupied Afghanistan threatens both Iran and Pakistan and is a steppingstone to possible control over much of the world s oil supplies . The United States wants all nations in the region to be free and to be independent . If the Soviets are encouraged in this invasion by eventual success , and if they maintain their dominance over Afghanistan and then extend their control to adjacent countries , the stable , strategic , and peaceful balance of the entire world will be changed . This would threaten the security of all nations including , of course , the United States , our allies , and our friends . Therefore , the world simply cannot stand by and permit the Soviet Union to commit this act with impunity . Fifty nations have petitioned the United Nations Security Council to condemn the Soviet Union and to demand the immediate withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan . We realize . that under the United Nations Charter the Soviet Union and other permanent members may veto action of the Security Council . If the will of the Security Council should be thwarted in this manner , then immediate action would be appropriate in the General Assembly of the United Nations , where no Soviet veto exists . In the meantime , neither the United States nor any other nation which is committed to world peace and stability can continue to do business as usual with the Soviet Union . I have already recalled the United States Ambassador from Moscow hack to Washington . He is working with me and with my other senior advisers in an immediate and comprehensive evaluation of the whole range of our relations with the Soviet Union . The successful negotiation of the SALT II treaty has been a major goal and a major achievement of this administration , and we Americans , the people of the Soviet Union , and indeed the entire world will benefit from the successful control of strategic nuclear weapons through the implementation of this carefully negotiated treaty . However , because of the Soviet aggression , I have asked the United States Senate to defer further consideration of the SALT II treaty so that the Congress and I can assess Soviet actions and intentions and devote our primary attention to the legislative and other measures required to respond to this crisis . As circumstances change in the future , we will , of course , keep the ratification of SALT II under active review in consultation with the leaders of the Senate . The Soviets must understand our deep concern . We will delay opening of any new American or Soviet consular facilities , and most of the cultural and economic exchanges currently under consideration will be deferred . Trade with the Soviet Union will be severely restricted . I have decided to halt or to reduce exports to the Soviet Union in three areas that are particularly important to them . These new policies are being and will be coordinated with those of our allies . I have directed that no high technology or other strategic items will be licensed for sale to the Soviet Union until further notice , while we revise our licensing policy . Fishing privileges for the Soviet Union in United States waters will be severely curtailed . The 17 million tons of grain ordered by the Soviet Union in excess of that amount which we are committed to sell will not be delivered . This grain was not intended for human consumption but was to be used for building up Soviet livestock herds . I am determined to minimize any adverse impact on the American farmer from this action . The undelivered grain will be removed from the market through storage and price support programs and through purchases at market prices . We will also increase amounts of grain devoted to the alleviation of hunger in poor countries , and we will have a massive increase of the use of grain for gasohol production here at home . After consultation with other principal grain exporting nations , I am confident that they will not replace these quantities of grain by additional shipments on their part to the Soviet Union . These actions will require some sacrifice on the part of all Americans , but there is absolutely no doubt that these actions are in the interest of world peace and in the interest of the security of our own Nation , and they are also compatible with actions being taken by our own major trading partners and others who share our deep concern about this new Soviet threat to world stability . Although the United States would prefer not to withdraw from the Olympic games scheduled in Moscow this summer , the Soviet Union must realize that its continued aggressive actions will endanger both the participation of athletes and the travel to Moscow by spectators who would normally wish to attend the Olympic games . Along with other countries , we will provide military equipment , food , and other assistance to help Pakistan defend its independence and its national security against the seriously increased threat it now faces from the north . The United States also stands ready to help other nations in the region in similar ways . Neither our allies nor our potential adversaries should have the slightest doubt about our willingness , our determination , and our capacity to take the measures I have outlined tonight . I have consulted with leaders of the Congress , and I am confident they will support legislation that may be required to carry out these measures . History teaches , perhaps , very few clear lessons . But surely one such lesson learned by the world at great cost is that aggression , unopposed , becomes a contagious disease . The response of the international community to the Soviet attempt to crush Afghanistan must match the gravity of the Soviet action . With the support of the American people and working with other nations , we will deter aggression , we will protect our Nation s security , and we will preserve the peace . The United States will meet its responsibilities . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>
