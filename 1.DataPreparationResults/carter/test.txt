To Father Hesburgh and the great faculty of Notre Dame , to those who have been honored this afternoon with the degree from your great university , to the graduate and undergraduate group who , I understand , is the largest in the history of this great institution , friends and parents Thank you for that welcome . I am very glad to be with you . You may have started a new graduation trend which I do not deplore , that is , throwing peanuts on graduation day . The more that are used or consumed the higher the price goes . I really did appreciate the great honor bestowed upon me this afternoon . My other degree is blue and gold from the Navy , and I want to let you know that I do feel a kinship with those who are assembled here this afternoon . I was a little taken aback by the comment that I had brought a new accent to the White House . In the minds of many people in our country , for the first time in almost 150 years , there is no accent . I tried to think of a story that would illustrate two points simultaneously and also be brief , which is kind of a difficult assignment . I was sitting on the Truman Balcony the other night with my good friend , Charles Kirbo , who told me about a man who was arrested and taken in to court for being drunk and for setting a bed on fire . When the judge asked him how he pled , he said , not guilty . He said , I was drunk but the bed was on fire when I got in it . I think most of the graduates can draw the parallel between that statement and what you are approaching after this graduation exercise . But there are two points to that , and I will come to the other one in just a few minutes . In his 25 years as president of Notre Dame , Father Hesburgh has spoken more consistently and more effectively in the support of the rights of human beings than any other person I know . His interest in the Notre Dame Center for Civil Rights has never wavered . And he played an important role in broadening the scope of the center s work and I visited there last fall to see this work include , now , all people in the world , as shown by last month s conference here on human rights and American foreign policy . And that concern has been demonstrated again today in a vivid fashion by the selection of Bishop Donal Lamont , Paul Cardinal Arns , and Stephen Cardinal Kim to receive honorary degrees . In their fight for human freedoms in Rhodesia , Brazil , and South Korea , these three religious leaders typify all that is best in their countries and in our church . I am honored to join you in recognizing their dedication , their personal sacrifice , and their supreme courage . Quite often , brave men like these are castigated and sometimes punished , sometimes even put to death , because they enter the realm where human rights is a struggle . And sometimes they are blamed for the very circumstance which they helped to dramatize , but it is been there for a long time . And the flames which they seek to extinguish concern us all and are increasingly visible around the world . Last week , I spoke in California about the domestic agenda for our Nation to provide more efficiently for the needs of our people , to demonstrate against the dark faith of our times that our Government can be both competent and more humane . But I want to speak to you today about the strands that connect our actions overseas with our essential character as a nation . I believe we can have a foreign policy that is democratic , that is based on fundamental values , and that uses power and influence , which we have , for humane purposes . We can also have a foreign policy that the American people both support and , for a change , know about and understand . I have a quiet confidence in our own political system . Because we know that democracy works , we can reject the arguments of those rulers who deny human rights to their people . We are confident that democracy s example will be compelling , and so we seek to bring that example closer to those from whom in the past few years we have been separated and who are not yet convinced about the advantages of our kind of life . We are confident that the democratic methods are the most effective , and so we are not tempted to employ improper tactics here at home or abroad . We are confident of our own strength , so we can seek substantial mutual reductions in the nuclear arms race . And we are confident of the good sense of American people , and so we let them share in the process of making foreign policy decisions . We can thus speak with the voices of 215 million , and not just of an isolated handful . Democracy s great recent successes in India , Portugal , Spain , Greece show that our confidence in this system is not misplaced . Being confident of our own future , we are now free of that inordinate fear of communism which once led us to embrace any dictator who joined us in that fear . I am glad that that is being changed . For too many years , we have been willing to adopt the flawed and erroneous principles and tactics of our adversaries , sometimes abandoning our own values for theirs . We have fought fire with fire , never thinking that fire is better quenched with water . This approach failed , with Vietnam the best example of its intellectual and moral poverty . But through failure we have now found our way back to our own principles and values , and we have regained our lost confidence . By the measure of history , our Nation s 200 years are very brief , and our rise to world eminence is briefer still . It dates from 1945 , when Europe and the old international order lay in ruins . Before then , . America was largely on the periphery of world affairs . But since then , we have inescapably been at the center of world affairs . Our policy during this period was guided by two principles a belief that Soviet expansion was almost inevitable but that it must be contained , and the corresponding belief in the importance of an almost exclusive alliance among non Communist nations on both sides of the Atlantic . That system could not last forever unchanged . Historical trends have weakened its foundation . The unifying threat of conflict with the Soviet Union has become less intensive , even though the competition has become more extensive . The Vietnamese war produced a profound moral crisis , sapping worldwide faith in our own policy and our system of life , a crisis of confidence made even more grave by the covert pessimism of some of our leaders . In less than a generation , we have seen the world change dramatically . The daily lives and aspirations of most human beings have been transformed . Colonialism is nearly gone . A new sense of national identity now exists in almost 100 new countries that have been formed in the last generation . Knowledge has become more widespread . Aspirations are higher . As more people have been freed from traditional constraints , more have been determined to achieve , for the first time in their lives , social justice . The world is still divided by ideological disputes , dominated by regional conflicts , and threatened by danger that we will not resolve the differences of race and wealth without violence or without drawing into combat the major military powers . We can no longer separate the traditional issues of war and peace from the new global questions of justice , equity , and human rights . It is a new world , but America should not fear it . It is a new world , and we should help to shape it . It is a new world that calls for a new American foreign policy a policy based on constant decency in its values and on optimism in our historical vision . We can no longer have a policy solely for the industrial nations as the foundation of global stability , but we must respond to the new reality of a politically awakening world . We can no longer expect that the other 150 nations will follow the dictates of the powerful , but we must continue confidently our efforts to inspire , to persuade , and to lead . Our policy must reflect our belief that the world can hope for more than simple survival and our belief that dignity and freedom are fundamental spiritual requirements . Our policy must shape an international system that will last longer than secret deals . We cannot make this kind of policy by manipulation . Our policy must be open it must be candid it must be one of constructive global involvement , resting on five cardinal principles . I have tried to make these premises clear to the American people since last January . Let me review what we have been doing and discuss what we intend to do . First , we have reaffirmed America s commitment to human rights as a fundamental tenet of our foreign policy . In ancestry , religion , color , place of origin , and cultural background , we Americans are as diverse a nation as the world has even seen . No common mystique of blood or soil unites us . What draws us together , perhaps more than anything else , is a belief in human freedom . We want the world to know that our Nation stands for more than financial prosperity . This does not mean that we can conduct our foreign policy by rigid moral maxims . We live in a world that is imperfect and which will always be imperfect a world that is complex and confused and which will always be complex and confused . I understand fully the limits of moral suasion . We have no illusion that changes will come easily or soon . But I also believe that it is a mistake to undervalue the power of words and of the ideas that words embody . In our own history , that power has ranged from Thomas Paine s Common Sense to Martin Luther King , s I Have a Dream . In the life of the human spirit , words are action , much more so than many of us may realize who live in countries where freedom of expression is taken for granted . The leaders of totalitarian nations understand this very well . The proof is that words are precisely the action for which dissidents in those countries are being persecuted . Nonetheless , we can already see dramatic , worldwide advances in the protection of the individual from the arbitrary power of the state . For us to ignore this trend would be to lose influence and moral authority in the world . To lead it will be to regain the moral stature that we once had . The great democracies are not free because we are strong and prosperous . I believe we are strong and influential and prosperous because we are free . Throughout the world today , in free nations and in totalitarian countries as well , there is a preoccupation with the subject of human freedom , human rights . And I believe it is incumbent on us in this country to keep that discussion , that debate , that contention alive . No other country is as well qualified as we to set an example . We have our own shortcomings and faults , and we should strive constantly and with courage to make sure that we are legitimately proud of what we have . Second , we have moved deliberately to reinforce the bonds among our democracies . In our recent meetings in London , we agreed to widen our economic cooperation , to promote free trade , to strengthen the world s monetary system , to seek ways of avoiding nuclear proliferation . We prepared constructive proposals for the forthcoming meetings on North South problems of poverty , development , and global well being . And we agreed on joint efforts to reinforce and to modernize our common defense . You may be interested in knowing that at this NATO meeting , for the first time in more than 25 years , all members are democracies . Even more important , all of us reaffirmed our basic optimism in the future of the democratic system . Our spirit of confidence is spreading . Together , our democracies can help to shape the wider architecture of global cooperation . Third , we have moved to engage the Soviet Union in a joint effort to halt the strategic arms race . This race is not only dangerous , it is morally deplorable . We must put an end to it . I know it will not be easy to reach agreements . Our goal is to be fair to both sides , to produce reciprocal stability , parity , and security . We desire a freeze on further modernization and production of weapons and a continuing , substantial reduction of strategic nuclear weapons as well . We want a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing , a prohibition against all chemical warfare , no attack capability against space satellites , and arms limitations in the Indian Ocean . We hope that we can take joint steps with all nations toward a final agreement eliminating nuclear weapons completely from our arsenals of death . We will persist in this effort . Now , I believe in detente with the Soviet Union . To me it means progress toward peace . But the effects of detente should not be limited to our own two countries alone . We hope to persuade the Soviet Union that one country cannot impose its system of society upon another , either through direct military intervention or through the use of a client state s military force , as was the case with Cuban intervention in Angola . Cooperation also implies obligation . We hope that the Soviet Union will join with us and other nations in playing a larger role in aiding the developing world , for common aid efforts will help us build a bridge of mutual confidence in one another . Fourth , we are taking deliberate steps to improve the chances of lasting peace in the Middle East . Through wide ranging consultation with leaders of the countries involved Israel , Syria , Jordan , and Egypt we have found some areas of agreement and some movement toward consensus . The negotiations must continue . Through my own public comments , I have also tried to suggest a more flexible framework for the discussion of the three key issues which have so far been so intractable the nature of a comprehensive peace what is peace what does it mean to the Israelis what does it mean to their Arab neighbors secondly , the relationship between security and borders how can the dispute over border delineations be established and settled with a feeling of security on both sides and the issue of the Palestinian homeland . The historic friendship that the United States has with Israel is not dependent on domestic politics in either nation it is derived from our common respect for human freedom and from a common search for permanent peace . We will continue to promote a settlement which all of us need . Our own policy will not be affected by changes in leadership in any of the countries in the Middle East . Therefore , we expect Israel and her neighbors to continue to be bound by United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338 , which they have previously accepted . This may be the most propitious time for a genuine settlement since the beginning of the Arab Israeli conflict almost 30 years ago . To let this opportunity pass could mean disaster not only for the Middle East but , perhaps , for the international political and economic order as well . And fifth , we are attempting , even at the risk of some friction with our friends , to reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation and the worldwide spread of conventional weapons . At the recent summit , we set in motion an international effort to determine the best ways of harnessing nuclear energy for peaceful use while reducing the risks that its products will be diverted to the making of explosives . We have already completed a comprehensive review of our own policy on arms transfers . Competition in arms sales is inimical to peace and destructive of the economic development of the poorer countries . We will , as a matter of national policy now in our country , seek to reduce the annual dollar volume of arms sales , to restrict the transfer of advanced weapons , and to reduce the extent of our coproduction arrangements about weapons with foreign states . And just as important , we are trying to get other nations , both free and otherwise , to join us in this effort . But all of this that I have described is just the beginning . It is a beginning aimed towards a clear goal to create a wider framework of international cooperation suited to the new and rapidly changing historical circumstances . We will cooperate more closely with the newly influential countries in Latin America , Africa , and Asia . We need their friendship and cooperation in a common effort as the structure of world power changes . More than 100 years ago , Abraham Lincoln said that our Nation could not exist half slave and half free . We know a peaceful world cannot long exist one third rich and two thirds hungry . Most nations share our faith that , in the long run , expanded and equitable trade will best help the developing countries to help themselves . But the immediate problems of hunger , disease , illiteracy , and repression are here now . The Western democracies , the OPEC nations , and the developed Communist countries can cooperate through existing international institutions in providing more effective aid . This is an excellent alternative to war . We have a special need for cooperation and consultation with other nations in this hemisphere to the north and to the south . We do not need another slogan . Although these are our close friends and neighbors , our links with them are the same links of equality that we forge for the rest of the world . We will be dealing with them as part of a new , worldwide mosaic of global , regional , and bilateral relations . It is important that we make progress toward normalizing relations with the People s Republic of China . We see the American and Chinese relationship as a central element of our global policy and China as a key force for global peace . We wish to cooperate closely with the creative Chinese people on the problems that confront all mankind . And we hope to find a formula which can bridge some of the difficulties that still separate us . Finally , let me say that we are committed to a peaceful resolution of the crisis in southern Africa . The time has come for the principle of majority rule to be the basis for political order , recognizing that in a democratic system the rights of the minority must also be protected . To be peaceful , change must come promptly . The United States is determined to work together with our European allies and with the concerned African States to shape a congenial international framework for the rapid and progressive transformation of southern African society and to help protect it from unwarranted outside interference . Let me conclude by summarizing Our policy is based on an historical vision of America s role . Our policy is derived from a larger view of global change . Our policy is rooted in our moral values , which never change . Our policy is reinforced by our material wealth and by our military power . Our policy is designed to serve mankind . And it is a policy that I hope will make you proud to be Americans . Thank you .<speech_sep>Yes . Stone , I have had to make thousands of decisions since I have been President , serving in the Oval Office . And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country , I have learned in the process . I think I am a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated 4 years ago against President Ford . I have also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions . Mencken said that for every problem there is a simple answer . It would be neat and plausible and wrong . The fact is that this Nation , in the 8 years before I became President , had its own military strength decreased . Seven out of eight years , the budget commitments for defense went down , 37 percent , in all . Since I have been in office , we have had a steady , carefully planned , methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense . But what we have done is to use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace . We have not only kept peace for our own country , but we have been able to extend the benefits of peace to others . In the Middle East , we have worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt , successfully , and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability . This is a very good step forward for our Nation s security , and we will continue to do as we have done in the past . I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature . There are always troublespots in the world , and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President , alone in that Oval Office , affects our Nation directly , the involvement of the United States and also our American interests . That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every President who serves . That is what I have tried to do , successfully , by keeping our country at peace . Stone , in my State of the Union address earlier this year , I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country . In the past , we have not had an adequate military presence in that region . Now we have two major carrier task forces . We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region . And we have made it clear that working with our allies and others , that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world . But in doing this , we have made sure that we address this question peacefully , not injecting American military forces into combat , but letting the strength of our Nation be felt in a beneficial way . This , I believe , has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region , as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world . Well , there are various elements of defense . One is to control nuclear weapons , which I hope we will get to later on , because that is the most important single issue in this campaign . Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world . I think , habitually , Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas , when I and my predecessors both Democrats and Republicans have advocated resolving those troubles and those difficult areas of the world peacefully , diplomatically , and through negotiation . In addition to that , the buildup of military forces is good for our country , because we have got to have military strength in order to preserve the peace . But I will always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat , and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle . Strength is imperative for peace , but the two must go hand in hand . Again it is important to put the situation into perspective . In 1974 we had a so called oil shock , wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree . We had an even worse oil shock in 1979 . In 1974 we had the worst recession , the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War . The recession that resulted this time was the briefest we have had since the Second World War . In addition , we have brought down inflation . Earlier this year , the first quarter , we did have a very severe inflation pressure , brought about by the OPEC price increase . It averaged about 18 percent the first quarter of this year . The second quarter , we had dropped it down to about 13 percent . The most recent figures , the last 3 months , or the third quarter of this year , the inflation rate is 7 percent still too high , but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs 9 million new jobs in the last 3 1 2 years that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us . I noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan Kemp Roth proposal , which his own running mate , George Bush , described as voodoo economics , and said that it would result in a 30 percent inflation rate . And Business Week , which is not a Democratic publication , said that this Reagan Kemp Roth proposal and I quote them , I think was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this Nation . So , our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs , to improve the industrial complex of this country , to create tools for American workers , and at the same time would be anti inflationary in nature . So , to add 9 million new jobs , to control inflation , and to plan for the future with the energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead . Yes . Yes . We have demanded that the American people sacrifice , and they have done very well . As a matter of fact , we are importing today about one third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago . We have had a 25 percent reduction since the first year I was in office . At the same time , as I said earlier , we have added about 9 million net new jobs in that period of time a record never before achieved . Also , the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors One , conservation , which requires sacrifice , and the other one , increase in production of American energy , which is going along very well more coal this year than ever before in history , more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history . The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind , which will be implemented next year , would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs about a million in the next 2 years . And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600 , 000 jobs for young people . This has already passed the House now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate . Governor Reagan s proposal , the Reagan Kemp Roth proposal , is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public . He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least 130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal . I noticed that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in the Wall Street Journal this week . One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage , and several times this year , Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage . This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country which is typical of many Republican leaders in the past , but I think has been accentuated under Governor Reagan . In California I am surprised Governor Reagan brought this up he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that State under his administration . He more than doubled State spending while he was Governor 122 percent increase and had between a 20 and 30 percent increase in the number of employees in California . Thank you , sir . Thank you , Hilliard . When I was campaigning in 1976 , everywhere I went the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our Nation . We initiated a very fine urban renewal program , working with the mayors , the Governors , and other interested officials . This has been a very successful effort . That is one of the main reasons that we have had such an increase in the number of people employed . Of the 9 million people put to work in new jobs since I have been in office , 1 . 3 million of those has been among black Americans and another million among those who speak Spanish . We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit , mass transit . Under the windfall profits tax , we expect to spend about 43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country . We also are pursuing housing programs . We have had a 73 percent increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education . These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders , particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that had been deteriorating so rapidly in the past . It is very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens . I have brought into the top levels of Government into the White House , into administrative offices of the executive branch , into the judicial system highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded . I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a younger man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country . Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem . We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems , but we still have a long way to go . Ours is a nation of refugees , a nation of immigrants . Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes , which are being realized , for a better life , preserving their ethnic commitments , their family structures , their religious beliefs , preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries , but still forming themselves together in a very coherent society , which gives our Nation its strength . In the past , those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government . Since I have been President , I have appointed , for instance , more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous Presidents in the history of this country . I have done the same thing in the appointment of women , and also Spanish speaking Americans . To involve them in administration of government and a feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future . Well , it is obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life . We have made good progress , and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation , the minimum wage , welfare , national health insurance , those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic Party since ancient history in this country s political life are a very important element of the future . In all those elements , Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them , which , to me , shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life . This , to me , is a very important difference between him and me in this election , and I believe the American people will judge accordingly . There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown , central cities , with the new commitment on an energy policy , with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient , with a chance for a synthetic fuels program , solar power , this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends . Barbara , one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists . At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the We . stern world , we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism . Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment . There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years , in recent months , additional acts of violence against Jews in France and , of course , against those who live in Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations . Ultimately , the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations , who believe in terrorism as a policy , should have atomic weapons . Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons in countries like Libya or Iraq . We have even alienated some of our closest trade partners , because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries . When Governor Reagan has been asked about that , he makes a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation , or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons , is none of our business . And when he was asked specifically , recently , about Iraq , he said there is nothing we can do about it . This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all , and it is part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds . We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war . We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran that might be of a warlike nature . When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages , I announced then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely , that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns , which they have bought and paid for also , that the frozen Iranian assets would be released . That is been a consistent policy , one I intend to carry out . I did not hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future . What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights commercial air flights to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of airplanes , or the harboring of hijackers . Secondly , we all committed ourselves , as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office , not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives . Third , not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities . And , lastly , not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel s right to exist and recognizes Resolution 242 as a basis for a Middle East peace . These are a few of the things to which our Nation is committed , and we will continue with these commitments . Yes , I had be glad to . Inflation , unemployment , the cities all very important issues , but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons . Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons , to negotiate with the Soviet Union balanced , controlled , observable , and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry . There is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan . He has never supported any of those arms control agreements the limited test ban , SALT nor the antiballistic missile treaty , nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union , negotiated over a 7 year period , by myself and my two Republican predecessors . The Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty . There have been preliminary skirmishings in the committees of the Senate , but the treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote . It is understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement , or , maybe , an ill advised statement . You have got 99 other Senators to correct that mistake , if it is a mistake . But when a man who hopes to be President says , Take this treaty , discard it , do not vote , do not debate , do not explore the issues , do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing . Yes . Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements . He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty and I do not know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form but he also advocates the possibility he said it is been a missing element of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own Nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union . If President Brezhnev said , We will scrap this treaty , negotiated under three American presidents over a 7 year period of time we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations , it is obvious that as President , and all Americans would reject such a proposition . This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race . It would be very disturbing to American people . It would change the basic tone and commitment that our Nation has experienced ever since the Second World War , with all Presidents , Democratic and Republican , and would also be very disturbing to our allies , all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty . In addition to that , the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly . This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone , although it is said with a quiet voice . I think , to close out this discussion , it would be better to put into perspective what we are talking about . I had a discussion with my daughter , Amy , the other day , before I came here , to ask her what the most important issue was . She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms . This is a formidable force . Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion . If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars , you would have a trainload of TNT stretching across this Nation . That is one major war explosion in a warhead . We have thousands , equivalent of megaton , or million tons , of TNT warheads . The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President , and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents , because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected , is a very dangerous approach . I do not think there is any doubt that , in the future , the cost of oil is going to go up . What I have had as a basic commitment since I have been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil It can only be done in two ways one , to conserve energy , to stop the waste of energy , and secondly , to produce more American energy . We have been very successful in both cases . We have now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by onethird . We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day just a year ago . This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our Nation in the future , because with the windfall profits tax as a base , we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels , yes to expand rapidly the production of solar energy , yes and also to produce the conventional kinds of American energy . We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history . We will produce more coal this year than any year in history . We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history . And we have an opportunity now , with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports , to see a very good opportunity on the world international market , to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source . This exciting future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we have put into effect . Yes , sir . To repeat myself , we have this year the opportunity , which we will realize , to produce 800 million tons of coal an unequaled record in the history of our country . Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement , and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality of our water and our land . We cannot cast aside those regulations . We have a chance in the next 15 years , insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines , and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards , to triple the amount of coal we produce . Governor Reagan s approach to our energy policy , which has already proven its effectiveness , is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax , to return a major portion of 227 billion back to the oil companies , to do away with the Department of Energy , to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program , to put a minimal emphasis on solar power , to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplants as a major source of energy in the future . He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies . Sure . As a matter of fact , the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan , and this is a very well known fact . Also , recently , when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished , Governor Reagan responded , Amen . The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often . As a matter of fact , in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation , 100 percent of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration , and 95 percent of all the Alaska lands where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist . We have , with our 5 year plan for the leasing of offshore lands , proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954 . So , we are not putting restraints on American exploration we are encouraging it in every way we can . As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House , we will have a strong and viable social security system , free of the threat of bankruptcy . Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately , on four different occasions he has advocated making social security a voluntary system , which would , in effect , very quickly bankrupt it . I noticed also in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making social security more sound by reducing the adjustments in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation . These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security and the well being , and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age . But no matter what it takes in the future to keep social security sound , it must be kept that way . And although there was a serious threat to the social security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President , the action of the Democratic Congress , working with me , has been to put social security back on a sound financial basis . That is the way it will stay . Fine . These constant suggestions that the basic social security system should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country . It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them , that social security benefits should not be taxed , and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which social security payments are made to the retired people . We also need to continue to index the social security payments so that if inflation rises , the social security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact . In the past , the relationship between social security and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits . Governor Reagan , as a matter of fact , began his political career campaigning around this Nation against Medicare . Now we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance , with an emphasis on the prevention of disease an emphasis on outpatient care , not inpatient care an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who are ill an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance , so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill , then the insurance would help pay for it . These are the kind of elements of a national health insurance , important to the American people . Governor Reagan , again , typically is against such a proposal . When I opposed Medicare , there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress . I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed . I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them . I was opposing one piece of legislation as versus another . There is something else about social security of course , that does not come out of the payroll tax it comes out of the general fund that something should be done about . I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in social security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness , and they are receiving disability checks from social security every month while a State institution provides for all of their needs and their care . I think this debate on social security , Medicare , national health insurance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another , and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation . These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this Nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them . I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic Presidents , in his acceptance address and otherwise . I have never heard a candidate for President , who is a Republican , quote a Republican President , but when they get in office , they try to govern like Republicans . So , its good for the American people to remember there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues also , between the two parties that we represent . Barbara , reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan , I will try to answer your question . First of all , there is the historical perspective that I just described . This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party , as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last 4 years , as contrasted with Governor Reagan , who in most cases does typify his party , but in some cases , there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others . The most important crucial difference in this election campaign , in my judgment , is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that do not presently have it , particularly the terrorist nations . The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he is been running for President I think since 1968 to inject American military forces in places like North Korea , to put a blockade around Cuba this year , or in some instances , to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America this is typical of his longstanding inclination , on the use of American power , not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully , but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it . Obviously , no President wants war , and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan , if he were President , would want war . But a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace , through diplomacy , or in a careless way , in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past . But the President that I quoted had made a promise , a Democrat promise , and I quoted him because it was never kept . And today , you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today . And that is why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around , because they too want that promise kept . It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people . Yes . I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals or historical perspective of his own party . I do not think this can be better illustrated than in the case with guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our Nation . For 40 years , the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment . Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women s rights . Governor Reagan and the new Republican Party has departed from this commitment a very severe blow to the opportunity for women finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffered . When a man and a woman do the same amount of work , a man gets paid a dollar a woman only gets paid 59 cents . And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for women by the Federal Government or by the State governments . That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic Party and which is a very important commitment of mine , as contrasted with Governor Reagan s radical departure from the longstanding policy of his own party . Yes . Howard , I am a southerner , and I share the basic beliefs of my region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system . One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country . We have been remarkably successful , with the help of the Democratic Congress . We have deregulated the air industry , the rail industry , the trucking industry , financial institutions now working on the communications industry . In addition to that , I believe this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps since the long Depression years and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country . We have made remarkable success . It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress . So , my heritage as a southerner , my experience in the Oval Office , convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future . First of all , I had like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible . I think it is been a very constructive debate , and I hope it is helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan . Also , I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during this last few hours in my life . I have been President now for almost 4 years . I have had to make thousands of decisions , and each one of those decisions has been a learning process . I have seen the strength of my Nation , and I have seen the crises that it approached in a tentative way . And I have had to deal with those crises as best I could . As I have studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan , I have been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us . I think the results of this debate indicate that that fact is true . I consider myself in the mainstream of my party . I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who have served before me . The United States must be a nation strong the United States must be a nation secure . We must have a society that is just and fair . And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace , to create a peaceful world . I believe that since I have been in office , there ve been six or eight areas of combat evolve in other parts of the world . In each case , I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country . I have done that with moderation , with care , with thoughtfulness sometimes consulting experts . But I have learned in this last 3 1 2 years that when an issue is extremely difficult , when the call is very close , the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50 50 . And the final judgment about the future of our Nation war , peace , involvement , reticence , thoughtfulness , care , consideration , concern has to be made by the man in the Oval Office . It is a lonely job , but with the involvement of the American people in the process , with an open government , the job is a very gratifying one . The American people now are facing , next Tuesday , a lonely decision . Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country . And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference . If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960 , John Kennedy would never have been President of this Nation . And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968 , Hubert Humphrey would have been President Richard Nixon would not . There is a partnership involved . And our Nation , to stay strong , to stay at peace , to raise high the banner of human rights , to set an example for the rest of the world , to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in all other nations is my plan for the future . I ask the American people to join me in this partnership .<speech_sep>Good evening . More than six months ago , in April , I spoke to you about a need for a national policy to deal with our present and future energy problems , and the next day I sent my proposals to the Congress . The Congress has recognized the urgency of this problem and has come to grips with some of the most complex and difficult decisions that a legislative body has ever been asked to make . Working with Congress , we have now formed a new Department of Energy , headed by Secretary James Schlesinger . We have the ability to administer the new energy legislation , and congressional work on the National Energy Plan has now reached the final stage . Last week the Senate sent its version of the legislation to the conference committees , where Members of the House and Senate will now resolve differences between the bills that they have passed . There , in the next few weeks , the strength and courage of our political system will be proven . The choices facing the Members of Congress are not easy . For them to pass an effective and fair plan , they will need your support and your understanding your support to resist pressures from a few for special favors at the expense of the rest of us and your understanding that there can be no effective plan without some sacrifice from all of us . Tonight , at this crucial time , I want to emphasize why it is so important that we have an energy plan and what we will risk , as a nation , if we are timid or reluctant to face this challenge . It is crucial that you understand how serious this challenge is . With every passing month , our energy problems have grown worse . This summer we used more oil and gasoline than ever before in our history . More of our oil is coming from foreign countries . Just since April , our oil imports have cost us 23 billion about 350 worth of foreign oil for the average American family . A few weeks ago , in Detroit , an unemployed steelworker told me something that may reflect the feelings of many of you . President , he said , I do not feel much like talking about energy and foreign policy . I am concerned about how I am going to live . . . . I cannot be too concerned about other things when I have a 10 year old daughter to raise and I do not have a job and I am 56 years old . Well , I understand how he felt , but I must tell you the truth . And the truth is that you cannot talk about economic problems now or in the future without talking about energy . Let me try to describe the size and the effect of the problem . Our farmers are the greatest agricultural exporters the world has ever known , but it now takes all the food and fiber that we export in 2 years just to pay for 1 year of imported oil about 45 billion . This excessive importing of foreign oil is a tremendous and rapidly increasing drain on our national economy . It hurts every American family . It causes unemployment . Every 5 billion increase in oil imports costs us 200 , 000 American jobs . It costs us business investments . Vast amounts of American wealth no longer stay in the United States to build our factories and to give us a better life . It makes it harder for us to balance our Federal budget and to finance needed programs for our people . It unbalances our Nation s trade with other countries . This year , primarily because of oil , our imports will be at least 25 billion more than all the American goods the we sell overseas . It pushes up international energy prices because excessive importing of oil by the United States makes it easier for foreign producers to raise their prices . It feeds serious inflationary pressures in our own economy . If this trend continues , the excessive reliance on foreign oil could make the very security of our Nation increasingly dependent on uncertain energy supplies . Our national security depends on more than just our Armed Forces it also rests on the strength of our economy , on our national will , and on the ability of the United States to carry out our foreign policy as a free and independent nation . America overseas is only as strong as America at home . The Secretary of Defense said recently , The present deficiency of assured energy sources is the single surest threat . . . to our security and to that of our allies . Yesterday , after careful consideration , I announced the postponement of a major overseas trip until after Christmas because of the paramount importance of developing an effective energy plan this year . I have no doubt that this is the right decision , because the other nations of the world allies and adversaries alike await our energy decisions with a great interest and concern . As one of the world s largest producers of coal and oil and gas , why do we have this problem with energy , and why is it so difficult to solve One problem is that the price of all energy is going up , both because of its increasing scarcity and because the price of oil is not set in a free and competitive market . The world price is set by a foreign cartel the governments of the so called OPEC nations . That price is now almost five times as great as it was in 1973 . Our biggest problem , however , is that we simply use too much and waste too much energy . Our imports have more than tripled in the last 10 years . Although all countries could , of course , be more efficient , we are the worst offender . Since the great price rise in 1973 , the Japanese have cut their oil imports , the Germans , the French , the British , the Italians have all cut their oil imports . Meanwhile , although we have large petroleum supplies of our own and most of them do not , we in the United States have increased our imports more than 40 percent . This problem has come upon us suddenly . Ten years ago , when foreign oil was cheap , we imported just 2 1 2 million barrels of oil a day , about 20 percent of what we used . By 1972 , we were importing about 30 percent . This year , when foreign oil is very expensive , we are importing nearly 9 million barrels a day almost one half of all the oil we use . Unless we act quickly , imports will continue to go up , and all the problems that I have just described will grow even worse . There are three things that we must do to avoid this danger first , cut back on consumption second , shift away from oil and gas to other sources of energy and third , encourage production of energy here in the United States . These are the purposes of the new energy legislation . In order to conserve energy , the Congress is now acting to make our automobiles , our homes , and appliances more efficient and to encourage industry to save both heat and electricity . The congressional conference committees are now considering changes in how electric power rates are set in order to discourage waste , to reward those who use less energy , and to encourage a change in the use of electricity to hours of the day when demand is low . Another very important question before Congress is how to let the market price for domestic oil go up to reflect the cost of replacing it while , at the same time , protecting the American consumers and our own economy . We must face an unpleasant fact about energy prices . They are going up , whether we pass an energy program or not , as fuel becomes more scarce and more expensive to produce . The question is , who should benefit from those rising prices for oil already discovered Our energy plan captures and returns them to the public , where they can stimulate the economy , save more energy , and create new jobs . We will use research and development projects , tax incentives and penalties , and regulatory authority to hasten the shift from oil and gas to coal , to wind and solar power , to geothermal , methane , and other energy sources . We have also proposed , and the Congress is reviewing , incentives to encourage production of oil and gas here in our own country . This is where another major controversy arises . It is important that we promote new oil and gas discoveries and increased production by giving adequate prices to the producers . We have recommended that the price , for instance , of new natural gas be raised each year to the average price of domestic oil that would produce the same amount of energy . With this new policy , the gross income of gas producers would average about 2 billion each year more than at the present price level . New oil prices would also rise in 3 years to the present world level and then be increased annually to keep up with inflation . This incentive for new oil production would be the highest in the whole world . These proposals would provide adequate incentives for exploration and production of domestic oil and gas , but some of the oil companies want much more tens of billions of dollars more . They want greatly increased prices for old oil and gas energy supplies which have already been discovered and which are being produced now . They want immediate and permanent deregulation of gas prices , which would cost consumers 70 billion or more between now and 1985 . They want even higher prices than those we have proposed for new gas and oil , and they want the higher prices sooner . They want lower taxes on their profits . These are all controversial questions , and the congressional debates , as you can well imagine , are intense . The political pressures are great because the stakes are so high , billions and billions of dollars . We should reward individuals and companies who discover and produce new oil and gas , but we must not give them huge windfall profits on their existing wells at the expense of the American people . Now the energy proposal that I made to Congress last April has three basic elements to ensure that it is well balanced . First , it is fair both to the American consumers and to the energy producers , and it will not disrupt our national economy . Second , as I have said before , it is designed to meet our important goals for energy conservation , to promote a shift to more plentiful and permanent energy supplies and encourage increased production of energy in the United States . And third , it protects our Federal budget from any unreasonable burden . These are the three standards by which the final legislation must be judged . I will sign the energy bills only if they meet these tests . During the next few weeks , the Congress will make a judgment on these vital questions . I will be working closely with them . And you are also deeply involved in these decisions . This is not a contest of strength between the President and the Congress , nor between the House and the Senate . What is being measured is the strength and will of our Nation whether we can acknowledge a threat and meet a serious challenge together . I am convinced that we can have enough energy to permit the continued growth of our economy , to expand production and jobs , and to protect the security of the United States if we act wisely . I believe that this country can meet any challenge , but this is an exceptionally difficult one because the threat is not easy to see and the solution is neither simple nor politically popular . I said 6 months ago that no one would be completely satisfied with this National Energy Plan . Unfortunately , that prediction has turned out to be right . There is some part of this complex legislation to which every region and every interest group can object . But a common national sacrifice to meet this serious problem should be shared by everyone some proof that the plan is fair . Many groups have risen to the challenge . But , unfortunately , there are still some who seek personal gain over the national interest . It is also especially difficult to deal with long range , future challenges . A President is elected for just 4 years , a Senator for 6 , and our Representatives in Congress for only 2 years . It is always been easier to wait until the next year or the next term of office , to avoid political risk . But you did not choose your elected officials simply to fill an office . The Congress is facing very difficult decisions , courageously , and we have formed a good partnership . All of us in Government need your help . This is an effort which requires vision and cooperation from all Americans . I hope that each of you will take steps to conserve our precious energy and also join with your elected officials at all levels of government to meet this test of our Nation s judgment and will . These are serious problems , and this has been a serious talk . But our energy plan also reflects the optimism that I feel about our ability to deal with these problems . The story of the human race is one of adapting to changing circumstances . The history of our Nation is one of meeting challenges and overcoming them . This major legislation is a necessary first step on a long and difficult road . This energy plan is a good insurance policy for the future , in which relatively small premiums that we pay today will protect us in the years ahead . But if we fail to act boldly today , then we will surely face a greater series of crises tomorrow energy shortages , environmental damage , ever more massive Government bureaucracy and regulations , and illconsidered , last minute crash programs . I hope that , perhaps a hundred years from now , the change to inexhaustible energy sources will have been made , and our Nation s concern about energy will be over . But we can make that transition smoothly for our country and for our children and for our grandchildren only if we take careful steps now to prepare ourselves for the future . During the next few weeks , attention will be focused on the Congress , but the proving of our courage and commitment will continue , in different forms and places , in the months and the years , even generations ahead . It is fitting that I am speaking to you on an election day , a day which reminds us that you , the people , are the rulers of this Nation , that your Government will be as courageous and effective and fair as you demand that it be . This will not be the last time that as President , present difficult and controversial choices to you and ask for your help . I believe that the duties of this office permit me to do no less . But I am confident that we can find the wisdom and the courage to make the right decisions even when they are unpleasant so that we might , together , preserve the greatness of our Nation . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>, moderator of the second of the historic debates of the 1976 campaign between Gerald Ford of Michigan , Republican candidate for President , and Jimmy Carter of Georgia , Democratic candidate for President . Thank you , President Ford , and thank you , Governor Carter , for being with us tonight . The debate takes place before an audience in the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre in San Francisco . An estimated 100 million Americans are watching on television as well . San Francisco was the site of the signing of the United Nations Charter 31 years ago . Thus , it is an appropriate place to hold this debate , the subject of which is foreign and defense issues . The questioners tonight are Max Frankel , associate editor of the New York Times , Henry Trewhitt , diplomatic correspondent of the Baltimore Sun , and Richard Valeriani , diplomatic correspondent of NBC News . The ground rules tonight are basically the same as they were for the first debate 2 weeks ago . The questions will be alternated between candidates . By the toss of a coin , Governor Carter will take the first question . Each question sequence will be as follows The question will be asked , and the candidate will have up to 3 minutes to answer . His opponent will have up to 2 minutes to respond . And prior to the response , the questioner may ask a follow up question to clarify the candidate s answer , when necessary , with up to 2 minutes to reply . Each candidate will have 3 minutes for a closing statement at the end . President Ford and Governor Carter do not have notes or prepared remarks with them this evening , but they may take notes during the debate and refer to them . Frankel , you have the first question for Governor Carter . Well , I think this Republican administration has been almost all style and spectacular and not substance . We have got a chance tonight to talk about , first of all , leadership , the character of our country , and a vision of the future . In every one of these instances , the Ford administration has failed . And I hope tonight that I and Ford will have a chance to discuss the reason for those failures . Our country is not strong any more we are not respected any more . We can only be strong overseas if we are strong at home , and when I become President , we will not only be strong in those areas but also in defense a defense capability second to none . We have lost , in our foreign policy , the character of the American people . We have ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy . It is been one of secrecy and exclusion . In addition to that , we have had a chance to become now , contrary to our long standing beliefs and principles , the arms merchant of the whole world . We have tried to buy success from our enemies , and at the same time we have excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies . In addition to that , we have become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis . We talk about detente . The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente , and they have been getting it . We have not known what we have wanted , and we have been out traded in almost every instance . The other point I want to make is about our defense . We have got to be a nation blessed with the defense capability that is efficient , tough , capable , well organized , narrowly focused fighting capability . The ability to fight if necessary is the best way to avoid the chance for or the requirement to fight . And the last point I want to make is this Ford , Kissinger have continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon . Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Ford , and they have criticized the foreign policy of this administration . This is one instance where I agree with the Republican platform . I might say this in closing , and that is , that as far as foreign policy goes , Kissinger has been the President of this country . Ford has shown an absence of leadership and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be . That is got to be changed , and that is one of the major issues in this campaign of 1976 . Well , Ford , unfortunately , has just made a statement that is not true . I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy that would , obviously , be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be President of the country . I think that this is an instance for deliberate distortion , and this has occurred also in the question about defense . As a matter of fact , I have never advocated any cut of 15 billion in our defense budget . As a matter of fact , Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget . About a year ago , he cut the Pentagon budget 6 . 8 billion . After he fired James Schlesinger the political heat got so great that he added back about 3 billion . When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election , Ford added back another 1 1 2 billion . Immediately before the Kansas City convention he added back another 1 . 8 billion in the defense budget . And his own Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a 3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon . Obviously , this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes , which he is trying to do tonight . Now , we went into South Africa late , after Great Britain , Rhodesia , the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many , many years . We did not go in until right before the election , similar to what was taking place in 1972 , when Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time . And we have weakened our position in NATbecause the other countries in Europe supported the democratic forces in Portugal long before we did . We stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world . Well , I am not going to name my Cabinet before I get elected I have got a little ways to go before I start doing that . But I have an adequate background , I believe . I am a graduate of the Naval Academy , the first military graduate since Eisenhower . I have served as Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries in South America , Central America , Europe , the Middle East , and in Japan . I have traveled the last 21 months among the people of this country . I have talked to them , and I have listened . And I have seen at firsthand , in a very vivid way , the deep hurt that is come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and Chile and Pakistan and Angola and Watergate , CIA revelations . What we were formerly so proud of the strength of our country , its moral integrity , the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are , what our Constitution stands for has been gone . And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years , the American people and the Congress have been excluded . I believe I know what this country ought to be . I have been one who is loved my Nation , as many Americans do . And I believe that there is no limit placed on what we can be in the future if we can harness the tremendous resources militarily , economically and the stature of our people , the meaning of our Constitution in the future . Every time we have made a serious mistake in foreign affairs , it is been because the American people have been excluded from the process . If we can just tap the intelligence and ability , the sound commonsense , and the good judgment of the American people , we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed . And I am not going to exclude the American people from that process in the future , as Ford and Kissinger have done . This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home , strong defense , permanent commitments , not betray the principles of our country , and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy . Every time Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations and secret treaties that have been pursued and achieved , in supporting dictatorships , in ignoring human rights we are weak and the rest of the world knows it . So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country . And they do not require long experience in foreign policy nobody has that except a President who served a long time or a Secretary of State . But my background , my experience , my knowledge of the people of this country , my commitment to our principles that do not change those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world . First of all , I would quit conducting the decisionmaking process in secret , as has been a characteristic of Kissinger and Ford . In many instances we have made agreements , like in Vietnam , that have been revealed later on to our embarrassment . Recently , Ian Smith , the President of Rhodesia , announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Kissinger that he could not reveal . The American people do not know what those commitments are . We have seen in the past a destruction of elected governments , like in Chile , and the strong support of military dictatorship there . These kinds of things have hurt us very much . I would restore the concept of the fireside chat , which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt . And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress . When Harry Truman was President , he was not afraid to have a strong Secretary of Defense Dean Acheson , George Marshall were strong Secretaries of State excuse me , State . But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support . The Members of Congress , Arthur Vandenburg , Walter George , were part of the process . And before our Nation made a secret agreement and before we made a bluffing statement , we were sure that we had the backing not only of the President and the Secretary of State but also of the Congress and the people . This is a responsibility of the President , and I think it is very damaging to our country for Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the Secretary of State . Well , in the first place , I am not criticizing His Holiness the Pope . I was talking about Ford . The fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration . In the case of the Helsinki agreement , it may have been a good agreement at the beginning , but we have failed to enforce the so called Basket 3 part , which ensures the right of people to migrate , to join their families , to be free to speak out . The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe . Radio Free Europe is being jammed . We have also seen a very serious problem with the so called Sonnenfeldt document which , apparently , Ford has just endorsed , which said that there is an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union . And I would like to see Ford convince the Polish Americans and the Czech Americans and the Hungarian Americans in this county that those countries do not live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron Curtain . We also have seen Ford exclude himself from access to the public . He has not had a tough , cross examination type press conference in over 30 days . One press conference he had without sound . He is also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure . The Soviet Union , for instance , put pressure on Ford , and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world Alexander Solzhenitsyn . The Arabs have put pressure on Ford , and he is yielded , and he has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel , who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American companies . His own Secretary of Commerce had to be subpenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott . They did not volunteer the information he had to be subpenaed . And the last thing I had like to say is this This grain deal with the Soviet Union in 72 was terrible , and Ford made up for it with three embargoes one against our own ally in Japan . That is not the way to run our foreign policy , including international trade . I would never single out food as a trade embargo item . If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships , it would include all shipments of all equipment . For instance , if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our Nation on oil , I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war . And I would respond instantly and in kind . I would not ship that Arab country anything no weapons , no spare parts for weapons , no oil drilling rigs , no oil pipe , no nothing . I would not single out just food . Another thing I had like to say is this In our international trade , as I said in my opening statement , we have become the arms merchant of the world . When this Republican administration came into office , we were shipping about 1 billion worth of arms overseas now 10 to 12 billion worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other . The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me , speaking about the Middle East . Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel . Nowadays 75 percent were for Israel before now 60 percent go to the Arab countries , and this does not include Iran . If you include Iran , our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East only 20 percent goes to Israel . This is a deviation from idealism it is a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East , which is Israel it is a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue and it is also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration , we have not addressed the energy policy adequately . We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country , and it is an overall sign of weakness . When we are weak at home economically high unemployment , high inflation , a confused Government , a wasteful Defense Establishment this encourages the kind of pressure that is been put on us successfully . It would have been inconceivable 10 , 15 years ago for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo . But it was done 3 years ago and they are still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world . These are the weaknesses that I see , and I believe it is not just a matter of idealism . It is a matter of being tough . It is a matter of being strong . It is a matter of being consistent . Our priorities ought to be , first of all , to meet our own military needs secondly , to meet the needs of our allies and friends , and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries . As a matter of fact , Iran is going to get 80 F 14 s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F 14 s , and the shipment of Spruance Class Destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance Class Destroyers that are presently being delivered to our own Navy . This is ridiculous , and it ought to be changed . If Iran is not an Arab country , as you know , it is a Moslem country . But if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us , then I would consider that an economic declaration of war . And I would make sure that the Saudis understood this ahead of time , so there would be no doubt in their mind . I think under those circumstances , they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with the previous oil embargo . I had like to go back just one moment to the previous question , where Ford , I think , confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid . As a matter of fact , during this current year , we are shipping Iran or have contracted to ship to Iran about 7 billion worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia about 7 billion worth of arms . Also , in 1975 we almost brought Israel to their knees after the Yom Kippur war by the so called reassessment of our relationship to Israel . We , in effect , tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East . And this weakened our relationship with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis . There ought to be a clear , unequivocal commitment without change to Israel . In the Far East I think we need to continue to be strong , and I would certainly pursue the normalization of relationships with the People s Republic of China . We opened up a great opportunity in 1972 which has pretty well been frittered away under Ford that ought to be a constant inclination toward friendship . But I would never let that friendship with the People s Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan . Well , always in the past we have had an ability to have a strong defense and also to have a strong domestic economy and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations . These characteristics of our country have been endangered under Ford . We are no longer respected . In a showdown vote in the United Nations or in any other international council we are lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us . Our allies feel that we have neglected them . The so called Nixon shocks against Japan have weakened our relationships there . Under this administration we have also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries , thinking that if they are separate , then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret Lone Ranger type diplomatic efforts . I would also like to point out that we in this country have let our economy go down the drain the worst inflation since the Great Depression , the highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world . We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain , than West Germany our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy it is three or four times as high as it is in Japan . And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas . We comprise about 30 percent of the world s economic trade power influence . And when we are weak at home , weaker than all our allies , that weakness weakens the whole free world . So , strong economy is very important . Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends they have felt neglected . And using that base of strength , and using the idealism , the honesty , the predictability , the commitment , the integrity of our own country that is where our strength lies . And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength . Under this administration , we have bad a continuation of a so called balance of power politics where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side and the Soviet Union on the other . Our allies , the smaller countries , get trampled in the rush . What we need is to try to seek individualized , bilateral relationships with countries regardless of their size and to establish world order politics , which means we want to preserve peace through strength . We also want to revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations . Now , I cannot say when this can come , but I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued . It will come if I am elected . Let me say very quickly that under President Johnson , in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam war , he turned over a balanced budget to Nixon . The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent . The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent out third what it is under this administration . So , we did have at that time , with good management , the ability to do both . I do not think anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world . But I can say this The number one responsibility of any President , above all else , is to guarantee the security of our Nation , an ability to be free of the threat of attack or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy . They must go hand in hand . But the security of this Nation has got to come first . Rabin said that our relations were never better . Well , Ford acts like he is running for President for the first time . He has been in office 2 years , and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement . He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT apparently . We have seen in this world a development of a tremendous threat to us . As a nuclear engineer myself , I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power . I also know that as far as the human beings on this Earth are concerned , that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one . Only in the last few days , with the election approaching , has Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement . I advocated last May , in a speech at the United Nations , that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices , both weapons and peaceful devices , that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives . I have also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of reprocessing plants to Pakistan and Brazil . Ford has not moved on this . We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium . Ford again , under pressure from the atomic energy lobby , has insisted that this reprocessing or rather reenrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing government plants . This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for 2 years with the constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world . We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about . If we continue under Ford s policy , by 1985 or 90 we will have 20 nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons . This has got to be stopped . That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next President . No , it is not just campaign rhetoric . I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on Earth . I think we have got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat . But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles as far as strength derived from the unity within our country as far as strength derived from the people , the Congress , the Secretary of State , the President , sharing in the evolution and carrying out of a foreign policy as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends , their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment , that we will not deviate , and we will give them adequate attention as far as strength derived from doing what is right , caring for the poor , providing food , becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world in those respects we are not strong . Also , we will never be strong again overseas unless we are strong at home . And with our economy in such terrible disarray , and getting worse by the month we have got 500 , 000 more Americans unemployed today than we had 3 months ago we have got 2 1 2 million more Americans out of work now than we had when Ford took office this kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world . And we not only have problems at home but we export those problems overseas . So , as far as the respect of our own people toward our own Government , as far as participation in the shaping of concepts and commitments , as far as a trust of our country among the nations of the world , as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we have expressed to our allies , as far as the respect of our country , even among our potential adversaries , we are weak . Potentially , we are strong . Under this administration that strength has not been realized . I noticed that Ford did not comment on the prisons in Chile . This is a typical example , maybe of many others , where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship . This has not been an ancient history story . Last year , under Ford , of all the Food for Peace that went to South America , 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile . Another point I want to make is this He says we have to move from one area of the world to another . That is one of the problems with this administration s so called shuttle diplomacy . While the Secretary of State is in one country , there are almost 150 others that are wondering what we are going to do next , what will be the next secret agreement . We do not have a comprehensive , understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems . Another thing that concerned me was what Ford said about unemployment , that insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war . Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing for war . Karl Marx was the grandfather of communism . I do not agree with that statement I hope Ford does not , either . He has put pressure on the Congress and I do not believe Ford would even deny this to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an 8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium . And the last thing I want to make is this He talks about peace , and I am thankful for peace . We were peaceful when Ford went into office , but he and Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola . And it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when this secret deal was discovered that prevented our renewed involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there . Well , here again , the Panamanian question is one that has been confused by Ford . He had directed his diplomatic representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time . When Reagan raised this question in Florida , Ford not only disavowed his instructions but he also even dropped , parenthetically , the use of the word detente . I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone , but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians . When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900 s , when Theodore Roosevelt was President , Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone . We retained control as though we had sovereignty . Now , I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations . I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama . I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone . I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zone , but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zone any time in the foreseeable future . Accounting Office has just put out a report suggesting that you shot from the hip in the Mayaguez rescue mission and that you ignored diplomatic messages saying that a peaceful solution was in prospect . Why did not you do more diplomatically at the time And a related question Did the White I House try to prevent the release of that report Governor Carter . Well , I am reluctant to comment on the recent report . I have not read it . I think the American people have only one requirement that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely . Ford has been there for 18 months . He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident . I understand that the report today is accurate . Ford has said , I believe , that it was accurate and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report . I do not know if that is exactly accurate or not . I understand that both the Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today s report , or yesterday s report , and also the National Security Agency . I do not know what was right or what was wrong or what was done . The only thing I believe is that whatever the knowledge was that Ford had should have been given to the American people 18 months ago , immediately after the Mayaguez incident occurred . This is what the American people want . When something happens that endangers our security , or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world , or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country , just 40 sailors on the Mayaguez , we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them . But then , after the immediate action is taken , I believe the President has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait 18 months later for the report to be issued . I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries , because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company , is an absolute disgrace . This is the first time that I remember in the history of our country when we have let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights . I will do everything I can as President to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries . It is not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me it is a matter of morality . And I do not believe that the Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong President who will protect the integrity of our country , the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights , and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews it may later be Catholics , it may later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country . But we ought to stand staunch . And I think it is a disgrace that so far Ford s administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would have revealed by law every instance of the boycott , and it would have prevented the boycott from continuing . One of the most embarrassing failures of the Ford administration , and one that touches specifically on human rights , is his refusal to appoint a Presidential commission to go to Vietnam , to go to Laos , to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars . This is what the families of MIA s want . So far , Ford has not done it . We have had several fragmentary efforts by Members of the Congress and by private citizens . Several months ago the Vietnam Government said we are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIA s . So far , Ford has not responded . I also would never formalize relationships with Vietnam nor permit them to join the United Nations until they have taken this action . But that is not enough . We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the President , the leader of this country , to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt , and Ford has just not done it . The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things leadership , upholding the principles of our country , and proper priorities and commitments for the future . This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children . Will it be a nightmare world , threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs , not just in five major countries , but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation Will we have a world of hunger and barred , and will we be living in an armed camp , stripped of our friendships and allies , hiding behind a tight defense that has been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our Government our Government to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated , with full trade , with our people at work , inflation controlled , openness in government , our people proud once again Congress , citizens , President , Secretary of State , working in harmony and unity toward a common future , a world where people have enough to cat , arid a world where we care about those who do not Can we become a breadbasket of the world , instead of the arms merchant of the world I believe we can and we ought to . Now , we have been hurt in recent years in this country , in the aftermath of Vietnam , Cambodia , Chile , Pakistan , Angola , Watergate , CIWe have been hurt . Our people feel that we have lost something precious . That is not necessary . I want to see our Nation return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again . I remember the world of NATO and the world of point four and the world of the Marshall plan and a world of the Peace Corps . Why cannot we have that once again We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom , who search for individual liberty , who search for basic human rights . We have not been lately . We can be once again . We will never have that world leadership until we are strong at home , and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles . It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats . It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people , the vision of the Constitution , and an innate strong will and purpose that God has given us in the greatest nation on Earth , the United States .<speech_sep>For myself and for our Nation , I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land . In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation . As my high school teacher , Miss Julia Coleman , used to say We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles . Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first President , in 1789 , and I have just taken the oath of office on the Bible my mother gave me a few years ago , opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet Micah He hath showed thee , O man , what is good and what doth the Lord require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy God . This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning , a new dedication within our Government , and a new spirit among us all . A President may sense and proclaim that new spirit , but only a people can provide it . Two centuries ago our Nation s birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom , but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation . I have no new dream to set forth today , but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream . Ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty . It is that unique self definition which has given us an exceptional appeal , but it also imposes on us a special obligation , to take on those moral duties which , when assumed , seem invariably to be in our own best interests . You have given me a great responsibility to stay close to you , to be worthy of you , and to exemplify what you are . Let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust . Your strength can compensate for my weakness , and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes . Let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together , confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right . The American dream endures . We must once again have full faith in our country and in one another . I believe America can be better . We can be even stronger than before . Let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our Nation , for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future . We recall in special times when we have stood briefly , but magnificently , united . In those times no prize was beyond our grasp . But we cannot dwell upon remembered glory . We cannot afford to drift . We reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person . Our Government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate . We have already found a high degree of personal liberty , and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity . Our commitment to human rights must be absolute , our laws fair , our natural beauty preserved the powerful must not persecute the weak , and human dignity must be enhanced . We have learned that more is not necessarily better , that even our great Nation has its recognized limits , and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems . We cannot afford to do everything , nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future . So , together , in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good , we must simply do our best . Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home . And we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation . To be true to ourselves , we must be true to others . We will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home , for we know that the trust which our Nation earns is essential to our strength . The world itself is now dominated by a new spirit . Peoples more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun not just for the benefit of their own physical condition , but for basic human rights . The passion for freedom is on the rise . Tapping this new spirit , there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane . We are a strong nation , and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal , but on the nobility of ideas . We will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable , and we will fight our wars against poverty , ignorance , and injustice for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled . We are a purely idealistic Nation , but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness . Because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere . Our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights . We do not seek to intimidate , but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well being of all people . The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries . We pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world s armaments to those necessary for each nation s own domestic safety . And we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this Earth . We urge all other people to join us , for success can mean life instead of death . Within us , the people of the United States , there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence . And I join in the hope that when my time as your President has ended , people might say this about our Nation that we had remembered the words of Micah and renewed our search for humility , mercy , and justice that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion , and where there had been mistrust , built unity , with a respect for diversity that we had found productive work for those able to perform it that we had strengthened the American family , which is the basis of our society that we had ensured respect for the law , and equal treatment under the law , for the weak and the powerful , for the rich and the poor and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own Government once again . I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace , built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values . These are not just my goals , and they will not be my accomplishments , but the affirmation of our Nation s continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished , ever expanding American dream .<speech_sep>Good evening . Tonight I want to have an unpleasant talk with you about a problem that is unprecedented in our history . With the exception of preventing war , this is the greatest challenge that our country will face during our lifetime . The energy crisis has not yet overwhelmed us , but it will if we do not act quickly . It is a problem that we will not be able to solve in the next few years , and it is likely to get progressively worse through the rest of this century . We must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our children and our grandchildren . We simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources . By acting now we can control our future instead of letting the future control us . Two days from now , I will present to the Congress my energy proposals . . Its Members will be my partners , and they have already given me a great deal of valuable advice . Many of these proposals will be unpopular . Some will cause you to put up with inconveniences and to make sacrifices . The most important thing about these proposals is that the alternative may be a national catastrophe . Further delay can affect our strength and our power as a nation . Our decision about energy will test the character of the American people and the ability of the President and the Congress to govern this Nation . This difficult effort will be the moral equivalent of war , except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not to destroy . Now , I know that some of you may doubt that we face real energy shortages . The 1973 gas lines are gone , and with this springtime weather , our homes are warm again . But our energy problem is worse tonight than it was in 1973 or a few weeks ago in the dead of winter . It is worse because more waste has occurred and more time has passed by without our planning for the future . And it will get worse every day until we act . The oil and natural gas that we rely on for 75 percent of our energy are simply running out . In spite of increased effort , domestic production has been dropping steadily at about 6 percent a year . Imports have doubled in the last 5 years . Our Nation s economic and political independence is becoming increasingly vulnerable . Unless profound changes are made to lower oil consumption , we now believe that early in the 1980 s the world will be demanding more oil than it can produce . The world now uses about 60 million barrels of oil a day , and demand increases each year about 5 percent . This means that just to stay even we need the production of a new Texas every year , an Alaskan North Slope every 9 months , or a new Saudi Arabia every 3 years . Obviously , this cannot continue . We must look back into history to understand our energy problem . Twice in the last several hundred years , there has been a transition in the way people use energy . The first was about 200 years ago , when we changed away from wood which had provided about 90 percent of all fuel to coal , which was much more efficient . This change became the basis of the Industrial Revolution . The second change took . place in this century , with the growing use of oil and natural gas . They were more convenient and cheaper than coal , and the supply seemed to be almost without limit . They made possible the age of automobile and airplane travel . Nearly everyone who is alive today grew up during this period , and we have never known anything different . Because we are now running out of gas and oil , we must prepare quickly for a third change to strict conservation and to the renewed use of coal and to permanent renewable energy sources like solar power . The world has not prepared for the future . During the 1950 s , people used twice as much oil as during the 1940 s . During the 1960 s , we used twice as much as during the 1950 s . And in each of those decades , more oil was consumed than in all of man s previous history combined . World consumption of oil is still going up . If it were possible to keep it rising during the 1970 s and 1980 s by 5 percent a year , as it has in the past , we could use up all the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade . I know that many of you have suspected that some supplies of oil and gas are being withheld from the market . You may be right , but suspicions about the oil companies cannot change the fact that we are running out of petroleum . All of us have heard about the large oil fields on Alaska s North Slope . In a few years , when the North Slope is producing fully , its total output will be just about equal to 2 years increase in our own Nation s energy demand . Each new inventory of world oil reserves has been more disturbing than the last . World oil production can probably keep going up for another 6 or 8 years . But sometime in the 1980 s , it cannot go up any more . Demand will overtake production . We have no choice about that . But we do have a choice about how we will spend the next few years . Each American uses the energy equivalent of 60 barrels of oil per person each year . Ours is the most wasteful nation on Earth . We waste more energy than we import . With about the same standard of living , we use twice as much energy per person as do other countries like Germany , Japan , and Sweden . One choice , of course , is to continue doing what we have been doing before . We can drift along for a few more years . Our consumption of oil would keep going up every year . Our cars would continue to be too large and inefficient . Three quarters of them would carry only one person the driver while our public transportation system continues to decline . We can delay insulating our homes , and they will continue to lose about 50 percent of their heat in waste . We can continue using scarce oil and natural gas to generate electricity and continue wasting two thirds of their fuel value in the process . If we do not act , then by 1985 we will be using 33 percent more energy than we use today . We cannot substantially increase our domestic production , so we would need to import twice as much oil as we do now . Supplies will be uncertain . The cost will keep going up . Six years ago , we paid 3 . 7 billion for imported oil . Last year we spent 36 billion for imported oil nearly 10 times as much . And this year we may spend 45 billion . Unless we act , we will spend more than 550 billion for imported oil by 1985 more than 2 , 500 for every man , woman , and child in America . Along with that money that we transport overseas , we will continue losing American jobs and become increasingly vulnerable to supply interruptions . Now we have a choice . But if we wait , we will constantly live in fear of embargoes . We could endanger our freedom as a sovereign nation to act in foreign affairs . Within 10 years , we would not be able to import enough oil from any country , at any acceptable price . If we wait and do not act , then our factories will not be able to keep our people on the job with reduced supplies of fuel . Too few of our utility companies will have switched to coal , which is our most abundant energy source . We will not be ready to keep our transportation system running with smaller and more efficient cars and a better network of buses , trains , and public transportation . We will feel mounting pressure to plunder the environment . We will have to have a crash program to build more nuclear plants , strip mine and bum more coal , and drill more offshore wells than if we begin to conserve right now . Inflation will soar production will go down people will lose their jobs . Intense competition for oil will build up among nations and also among the different regions within our own country . This has already started . If we fail to act soon , we will face an economic , social , and political crisis that will threaten our free institutions . But we still have another choice . We can begin to prepare right now . We can decide to act while there is still time . That is the concept of the energy policy that we will present on Wednesday . Our national energy plan is based on 10 fundamental principles . The first principle is that we can have an effective and comprehensive energy policy only if the Government takes responsibility for it and if the people understand the seriousness of the challenge and are willing to make sacrifices . The second principle is that healthy economic growth must continue . Only by saving energy can we maintain our standard of living and keep our people at work . An effective conservation program will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs . The third principle is that we must protect the environment . Our energy problems have the same cause as our environmental problems wasteful use of resources . Conservation helps us solve both problems at once . The fourth principle is that we must reduce our vulnerability to potentially devastating embargoes . We can protect ourselves from uncertain supplies by reducing our demand for oil , by making the most of our abundant resources such as coal , and by developing a strategic petroleum reserve . The fifth principle is that we must be fair . Our solutions must ask equal sacrifices from every region , every class of people , and every interest group . Industry will have to do its part to conserve just as consumers will . The energy . producers deserve fair treatment , but we will not let the oil companies profiteer . The sixth principle , and the cornerstone of our policy , is to reduce demand through conservation . Our emphasis on conservation is a clear difference between this plan and others which merely encouraged crash production efforts . Conservation is the quickest , cheapest , most practical source of energy . Conservation is the only way that we can buy a barrel of oil for about 2 . It costs about 13 to waste it . The seventh principle is that prices should generally reflect the true replacement cost of energy . We are only Cheating ourselves if we make energy artificially cheap and use more than we can really afford . The eighth principle is that Government policies must be predictable and certain . Both consumers and producers need policies they can count on so they can plan ahead . This is one reason that I am working with the Congress to create a new Department of Energy to replace more than 50 different agencies that now have some control over energy . The ninth principle is that we must conserve the fuels that are scarcest and make the most of those that are plentiful . We cannot continue to use oil and gas for 75 percent of our consumption , as we do now , when they only make up 7 percent of our domestic reserves . We need to shift to plentiful coal , while taking care to protect the environment , and to apply stricter safety standards to nuclear energy . The tenth and last principle is that we must start now to develop the new , unconventional sources of energy that we will rely on in the next century . Now , these 10 principles have guided the development of the policy that I will describe to you and the Congress on Wednesday night . Our energy plan will also include a number of specific goals to measure our progress toward a stable energy system . These are the goals that we set for 1985 to reduce the annual growth rate in our energy demand to less than 2 percent to reduce gasoline consumption by 10 percent below its . current level to cut in half the portion of oil which is imported from a potential level of 16 million barrels to 6 million barrels a day to establish a strategic petroleum reserve of one billion barrels , more than a 6 months supply to increase our coal production by about two thirds to more than one billion tons a year to insulate 90 percent of American homes and all new buildings to use solar energy in more than 2 1 2 million houses . We will monitor our progress toward these goals year by year . Our plan will call for strict conservation measures if we fall behind . I cannot tell you that these measures will be easy , nor will they be popular . But I think most of you realize that a policy which does not ask for changes or sacrifices would not be an effective policy at this late date . This plan is essential to protect our jobs , our environment , our standard of living , and our future . Whether this plan truly makes a difference will not be decided now here in Washington but in every town and every factory , in every home and on every highway and every farm . I believe that this can be a positive challenge . There is something especially American in the kinds of changes that we have to make . We have always been proud , through our history , of being efficient people . We have always been proud of our ingenuity , our skill at answering questions . Now we need efficiency and ingenuity more than ever . We have always been proud of our leadership in the world . And now we have a chance again to give the world a positive example . We have always been proud of our vision of the future . We have always wanted to give our children and our grandchildren a world richer in possibilities than we have had ourselves . They are the ones that we must provide for now . They are the ones who will suffer most if we do not act . I have given you some of the principles of the plan . I am sure that each of you will find something you do not like about the specifics of our proposal . It will demand that we make sacrifices and changes in every life . To some degree , the sacrifices will be painful but so is any meaningful sacrifice . It will lead to some higher costs and to some greater inconvenience for everyone . But the sacrifices can be gradual , realistic , and they are necessary . Above all , they will be fair . No one will gain an unfair advantage through this plan . No one will be asked to bear an unfair burden . We will monitor the accuracy of data from the oil and natural gas companies for the first time , so that we will always know their true production , supplies , reserves , and profits . Those citizens who insist on driving large , unnecessarily powerful cars must expect to pay more for that luxury . We can be sure that all the special interest groups in the country will attack the part of this plan that affects them directly . They will say that sacrifice is fine as long as other people do it , but that their sacrifice is unreasonable or unfair or harmful to the country . If they succeed with this approach , then the burden on the ordinary citizen , who is not organized into an interest group , would be crushing . There should be only one test for this program whether it will help our country . Other generations of Americans have faced and mastered great challenges . I have faith that meeting this challenge will make our own lives even richer . If you will join me so that we can work together with patriotism and courage , we will again prove that our great Nation can lead the world into an age of peace , independence , and freedom . Thank you very much , and good night .<speech_sep>Well , I might say first of all , that I think in case of a Carter administration , the sacrifices would be much less . Ford s own environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if be is President . The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process , if they know that they will be helping to make decisions and will not be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose . The major effort that we must put forward is to put our people back to work . And I think that this is one example where a lot of people have selfish , grasping ideas now . I remember in 1973 , in the depth of the energy crisis , when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice to cut down on the waste of gasoline , to cut down on the speed of automobiles . It was a tremendous surge of patriotism . I want to make a sacrifice for my country I think we could call together with strong leadership in the White House business , industry , and labor , and say , let us have voluntary price restraints , let us lay down some guidelines so we do not have continuing inflation . We could also have an end to the extremes . We now have one extreme , for instance , of some welfare recipients who , by taking advantage of the welfare laws , the housing laws , the Medicaid laws , and the food stamp laws , make over 10 , 000 a year , and they do not have to pay any taxes on it . At the other extreme just I percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits . So both those extremes grasp for advantage , and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle income family who is still working for a living . And they have to pay for the rich who have the privilege and for the poor who are not working . But I think that a balanced approach , with everybody being part of it , and striving for unselfishness could help , as it did in 1973 , to let people sacrifice for their own country . I know I am ready for it I think the American people are , too . I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 bas been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials . When you have got 7 1 2 , 8 million people out of work , when you have got three times as much inflation as you had during the last 8 year Democratic administration , when you have the highest deficits in history , when you have it becoming increasingly difficult for a family to put a child through college or to own a home , there is a natural inclination to be turned off . Also , in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and Watergate and the CIA revelations , people have felt that they have been betrayed by public officials . I have to admit that in the heat of the campaign I have been in 30 primaries during the springtime I have been campaigning for 22 months I have made some mistakes . And I think this is part of just being a human being . I have to say that my campaign has been an open one . The Playboy thing bas been of very great concern to me . I do not know how to deal with it exactly . I agreed to give the interview to Playboy . Other people have done it who are notable Governor Jerry Brown , Walter Cronkite , Albert Schweitzer , Ford s own Secretary of Treasury , Simon , William Buckley , many other people . But they were not running for President . And in retrospect , from hindsight , I would not have given that interview had I to do it over again . If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my deep Christian beliefs and condemnation and sinfulness , l would use another forum besides Playboy . But I can say this I am doing the best I can to get away from that . And during the next 10 days , the American people will not see the Carter campaign running television advertisements or newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford s character . I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford s campaign . And I hope that we can leave those issues , in the next 10 days , about personalities and mistakes of the past we have both matte some mistakes and talk about unemployment , inflation , housing , education , taxation , government organization , stripping away of secrecy , and the things that are crucial to the American people . I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken , but I am trying to do away with those the last 10 days . I do not have any response . In the last 2 weeks I have had a chance to talk to two men who have visited the Soviet Union , Yugoslavia , and China . One is Governor Averell Harriman , 1 who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia , and the other one is James Schlesinger , 2 whom I think you accompanied to China . I got a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished gentlemen . 1 Governor of New York 1954 58 and Ambassador at Large 1961 , 1965 68 . 2Secretary of Defense 1973 75 . Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia , and I think it is accurate to say that there is no prospect , in their opinion , of the Soviet Union invading Yugoslavia should Tito pass away . The present leadership there is fairly uniform in their purpose . I think it is a close knit group , and I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war in Yugoslavia if the Soviets should invade , which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing . I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question that I would never go to war , become militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country , unless our own security was directly threatened . And I do not believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went into Yugoslavia . I do not believe it will happen . I certainly hope it will not . I would take the strongest possible measures short of actual military action there by our own troops , but I doubt that that would be an eventuality . No , I did not . Well , just briefly , I think this is the second time that General Brown has made a statement for which he did have to apologize and I know that everybody makes mistakes . I think the first one was related to the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and in the Congress . This one concerned Great Britain . I think he said Israel was a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire . I am not sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had expressed his concern about the statement or apologized for it . This is something , though , that I think is indicative of a need among the American people to know how the Commander in Chief , the President , feels . And I think the only criticism that I would have of Ford is that immediately when the statement was revealed , perhaps a statement from the President would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing . I do not believe it does . I began campaigning 22 months ago . At that time nobody thought I had a chance to win . Very few people knew who I was . I came from a tiny town , as you know Plains and did not hold public office , did not have very much money . And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children , my three sons and their wives . And we won the nomination by going out into the streets , barbershops , beauty parlors , restaurants , stores , in factory shift lines , also in farmers markets and livestock sale barns , and we talked a lot and we listened a lot , and we learned from the American people . We built up an awareness among the voters of this country , particularly those in whose primaries I entered 30 of them , nobody has ever done that before about who I was and what I stood for . Now we have a very wide ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics and foreign affairs , defense matters , health , education , welfare , government reorganization I had say several hundred of them , and they are very fine and very highly qualified . The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination and I share this with President Ford is the choice of the Vice President . I think this would be indicative of the kind of leaders that I would choose to help me if I am elected . I chose Senator Walter Mondale . And the only criterion that I have put forward in my own mind was , who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be President if something should happen to me and to join me in being Vice President if I should serve out my term And I am convinced now , more than I was when I got the nomination , that Walter Mondale was the right choice . And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people that I would choose in the future . Ford has had that same choice to make . I do not want to say anything critical of Senator Dole , but I have never heard Ford say that that was his primary consideration who is the best person I could choose in this country to be President of the United States . I feel completely at ease knowing that some day Senator Mondale might very well be President . In the last five Vice Presidential nominees , incumbents , three of them have become President . But I think this is indicative of what I would do . Well , I might say I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right . This administration s record of environment is very bad . I think it is accurate to say that the strip mining law , which was passed twice by the Congress and only lacked two votes , I believe , of being overridden , would have been good for the country . The claim that it would have put 140 , 000 miners out of work is hard to believe when at the time Ford vetoed it , the United Mine Workers was supporting the bill . And I do not think they would have supported the bill had they known that they would lose 140 , 000 jobs . There has been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or to delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards . And under both Presidents Nixon and Ford , moneys have been impounded that would have gone to cities and others to control water pollution . We have no energy policy . We , I think , are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy to permit us to plan , in an orderly way , how to shift from increasing the scarce energy forms oil and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal , which I strongly favor the research and development to be used primarily to make the coal burning be clean . We need a heritage trust program , similar to the one we had in Georgia , to set aside additional lands that have geological and archeological importance , natural areas for enjoyment . The lands that Ford brags about having approved are in Alaska , and they are enormous in size , but as far as the accessibility of them by the American people , is very far in the future . We have taken no strong position in the control of pollution of our oceans . And I would say the worst threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation . And this administration , having been in office now for 2 years or more , has still not taken a strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world , particularly plutonium . Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration . I would do the opposite in every respect . Yes , I would be glad to . In the first place , as is the case with the environmental policy and energy policy that I just described , and the policy for nonproliferation of nuclear waste , this administration has no urban policy . It is impossible for mayors or Governors to cooperate with the President , because they cannot anticipate what is going to happen next . A mayor of a city like New York , for example , needs to know 18 months or 2 years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing , in things like housing , pollution control , crime control , education , welfare and health . This has not been done , unfortunately . I remember the headline in the Daily News that said , Ford To New York Drop Dead . I think it is very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the Federal Government . Quite often , Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and better education programs and so forth . Those programs were designed to help those who need it most , and quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers . Because of the greatly advantaged persons who live in the suburbs better education , better organization , more articulate , more aware of what the laws are quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it is needed . Also , I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments and also to remove the prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money , so that it can be used to improve education and health care . We have now , for instance , only 7 percent of the total education costs being financed by the Federal Government . When the Nixon Ford administration started , this was 10 percent . That is a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the Federal Government contributes to education in just 8 years and , as you know , the education costs have gone up tremendously . The last point is that the major thrust has got to be to put people back to work . We have got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown , urban ghetto areas particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups , sometimes 50 or 60 percent . And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base , but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare costs . One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of New York City is to finance welfare . And I favor the shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether and , over a longer period of time , let the Federal Government begin to absorb part of it that is now paid by the State government . Those things would help a great deal with the cities , but we still have a very serious problem there . The description just made of this administration s record is hard to recognize . I think it is accurate to say that Ford voted against the voting rights acts and against the civil rights acts in their debative stage . I think once it was assured they were going to pass , he finally voted for it . This country changed drastically in 1969 when the terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over , and Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford became the Presidents . There was a time when there was hope for those who were poor and downtrodden and who were elderly or who were ill or who were in minority groups . That time has been gone . I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the civil rights acts and the opening up of opportunities to black people , to have a chance to vote , to hold a job , to buy a house , to go to school , and to participate in public affairs . It not only liberated black people but it also liberated the whites . We have seen in many instances in recent years a minority affairs section of a small loan administration , Small Business Administration , lend a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started , and then to go bankrupt . The bankruptcies have gone up an extraordinary degree . The FHA , which used to be a very responsible agency that everyone looked to to help own a home , lost 600 million last year . There have been over 1 , 300 indictments in HUover 800 convictions relating just to home loans . And now the Federal Government has become the world s greatest slum landlord . We have got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority young people . And there has been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black , or poor and who speak a foreign language . And that is where there has been a great generation of despair and ill health and lack of education and lack of purposefulness and a lack of hope for the future . But it does not take just a quiet , dormant , minimum enforcement of the law . It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it . And that is been lacking in the last 8 years . I would not work hard to support any of those . We have always had , I think , a lot of constitutional amendments proposed but the passage of them has been fairly slow and few and far between . In the 200 year history , there has been a very cautious approach to this . Quite often we have a transient problem . I am strongly against abortion . I think abortion is wrong . I do not think the Government ought to do anything to encourage abortion , but I do not favor a constitutional amendment on the subject . But short of a constitutional amendment , and within the confines of a Supreme Court ruling , I will do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education , family planning , with better adoptive procedures . I personally do not believe that the Federal Government ought to finance abortions , but I draw the line and do not support a constitutional amendment . However , I honor the right of people to seek the constitutional amendments on school busing , on prayer in the schools , and on abortion , but among those you named , I will not actively work for the passage of any of them . I think it is accurate to say that Ford s position on gun control has changed . Earlier , Levi , his Attorney General , put forward a gun control proposal which Ford later , I believe , espoused that called for the prohibition against the sale of the so called Saturday night specials . It would have put very strict control over who owned a handgun . I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns , rifles , and a handgun . And the only purpose that I would see in registering handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the ownership of those guns by those who have used them in the commission of a crime or who have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun . I believe that limited approach to the question would be advisable , and I think adequate , but that is as far as I would go with it . While I was Governor of Georgia , although I am not a lawyer , we had complete reform of the Georgia court system . We streamlined the structure of the courts , put in administrative offices , put a unified court system in , and required that all severe sentences be reviewed for uniformity and , in addition to that , put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office selection of all judges and district attorneys , prosecuting attorneys , on the basis of merit . Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total , and about half of the Court of Appeals judges , about 35 percent of the trial judges I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia , and from those five I always chose the first or second one . So , merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion . And I would institute the same kind of procedure as President , not only in judicial appointments but also in diplomatic appointments . Secondly , I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and most far reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court . Civil rights has been confirmed by the Burger Court . It has not been reversed . And I do not think there is any inclination to reverse those basic decisions of the one man one vote rule , which is a very important one that struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of sparsely populated areas of the States . The right of indigent or very poor accused persons to legal counsel I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court . Also , the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false confession . But now , I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty . And I think that in that case some of the more liberal members of the so called Warren Court agreed with those decisions . But the only thing that I have pointed out was what I have just said , and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you could not be forced to release a person who is obviously guilty just because of a small technicality in the law . And that is a reversal of position by the Burger Court with which I do agree . Okay , I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit . Once the search and analysis procedure had been completed , and once I am given a list of the 5 or 7 or 10 best qualified persons in the country , I would make a selection from among those persons . If the list was in my opinion fairly uniform , if there was no outstanding person , then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic political philosophy , as best as I could determine it , which would be to continue the progress that has been made under the last two Courts the Warren Court and the Burger Court . I would also like to completely revise our criminal justice system to do some of the things at the Federal level and court reform that I just described , as has been done in Georgia and other States . And I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that . I know Chief Justice Burger is . He has not had help yet from the administration and from the Congress to carry this out . The emphasis , I think , of the court system should be to interpret the Constitution and the laws equally between property protection and personal protection . But when there is a very narrow decision which quite often is one that reaches the Supreme Court I think the choice should be with human rights , and that would be another factor that I would follow . I think the answer as to the kind of person that I would select is obvious . I had one opportunity to nominate an individual to the Supreme Court , and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois , John Paul Stevens . I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals judge . And I was very pleased that an overwhelmingly Democratic United States Senate , after going into his background , came to the conclusion that he was fit and should serve , and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming . So , I would say somebody in the format of Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would select in the future , as I did him in the past . I believe , however , a comment ought to be made about the direction of the Burger Court vis a vis the Court that preceded it . It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very , very difficult for the police , the law enforcement people in this country , to do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes were properly handled and sent to jail . The Miranda case , the Burger Court is gradually changing . And I am pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the Burger Court to modify the so called Miranda decision . I might make a correction of what Governor Carter said , speaking of gun control . Yes , it is true , I believe that the sale of Saturday night specials should be cut out , but he wants the registration of handguns . Well , with all due respect to President Ford , I think he ought to be ashamed of making that statement because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression , caused by Herbert Hoover , and the time President Ford took office . We have got 7 1 2 million people out of jobs . Since he has been in office , 2 million more American people have lost their jobs . In the last 4 months alone , 500 , 000 Americans have gone on the unemployment rolls . In the last month , we have had a net loss of 163 , 000 jobs . Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives . One of the overwhelming results that I have seen in places is people feel that you cannot plan any more , there is no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kids through college . Saving accounts are losing money instead of gaining money . Inflation is robbing us . Under the present administrations Nixon s and Ford s we have had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy . The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year . And housing starts he compares the housing starts with last year , I do not blame him because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country , fewer homes built than any year since 1940 . That is 35 years . And we have got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers . And Ford has not done anything about it . And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much . He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for 2 million Americans . We will never have a balanced budget , we will never meet the needs of our people , we will never control the inflationary spiral as long as we have 7 or 8 million people out of work who are looking for jobs . And we have probably got 2 more million people who are not looking for jobs any more because they have given up hope . That is a very serious indictment of this administration . It is probably the worst one of all . Well , that is not exactly an accurate description of what happened . When I was that far ahead it was immediately following the Democratic Convention and before the Republican Convention . At that time 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford , but as occurred at the end of the Democratic Convention , the Republican Party unified itself , and I think immediately following the Republican Convention there was about a 10 point spread . I believe that to be accurate . I had 49 percent President Ford had 39 percent . The polls are good indications of fluctuations , but they vary widely one from another , and the only poll I have ever followed is the one that , you know , is taken on Election Day . I was in 30 primaries in the spring and at first it was obvious that I did not have any standing in the polls . As a matter of fact , I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December 1975 , they did not even put my name on the list . They had 35 people on the list my name was not even there . At the beginning of the year , I had about 2 percent . So the polls , to me , are interesting , but they do not determine my hopes or my despair . I campaign among people . I have never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office . I have a direct relationship with hundreds of thousands of people around the country who actively campaign for me . In Georgia alone , for instance , I got 84 percent of the vote , and I think there were 14 people in addition to myself on the ballot , and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia . That is an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best . And today we have about 500 Georgians at their own expense , just working people who believe in me , spread around the country involved in the political campaign . So the polls are interesting , but I do not know how to explain the fluctuations . I think a lot of it depends on current events sometimes foreign affairs , sometimes domestic affairs . But I think our core of support among those who are crucial to the election has been fairly steady . And my success in the primary season was , I think , notable for a newcomer , from someone who is outside of Washington , who never has been a part of the Washington establishment . And I think that we will have a good result on November 2 for myself and I hope for the country . The major purpose of an election for President is to choose a leader , someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country , to set a standard for our people to follow , to inspire people to reach for greatness , to correct our defects , to answer difficulties , to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity . I do not believe the present administration has done that . We have been discouraged and we have been alienated , sometimes we have been embarrassed , sometimes we have been ashamed . Our people are out of work , and there is a sense of withdrawal . But our country is innately very strong . Ford is a good and decent man , but he has been in office now more than 800 days , approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office . I would like to ask the American people what has been accomplished . A lot remains to be done . My own background is different from his . I was a school board member and a library board member , I served on a hospital authority , and I was in the State senate , and I was Governor and I am an engineer , a naval officer , a farmer , a businessman . I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress and can work closely with the people of this country , and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington . Our tax structure is a disgrace and needs to be reformed , I was Governor of Georgia for 4 years . We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property taxes . As a matter of fact , the year before we went out of office we gave a 50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia . We spend 600 per person in this country every man , woman , and child for health care . We still rank 15th among all of the nations in the world in infant mortality , and our cancer rate is higher than any country in the world . We do not have good health care . We could have it . Employment ought to be restored to our people . We have become almost a welfare state . We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did 8 years ago when the Republicans took over the White House . Our people want to go back to work . Our education system can be improved . Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government , and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained . Our housing programs have gone bad . It used to be that the average family could own a house , but now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes . The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country 65 billion primarily because our people are not at work . Inflation is robbing us , as we have already discussed , and the Government bureaucracy is just a horrible mess . This does not have to be . I do not know all of the answers . Nobody could . But I do know that if the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said , I believe our Nation is greater than what we are now , I believe that if we are inspired , if we can achieve a degree of unity , if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with Government at all levels , we can achieve great things . We might have to do it slowly . There are no magic answers to it , but I believe together we can make great progress , we can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions . I believe in the greatness of our country , and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington . We have been drifting too long . We have been dormant too long . We have been discouraged too long . And we have not set an example for our own people , but I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress , a good relationship with our people , set very high goals for our country , and with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things and let the world know that is very important , but more importantly , let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest Nation on Earth . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>
