I want to talk to you today about the tragedy in Somalia and about a mission that can ease suffering and save lives . Every American has seen the shocking images from Somalia . The scope of suffering there is hard to imagine . Already , over a quarter million people , as many people as live in Buffalo , New York , have died in the Somali famine . In the months ahead 5 times that number , 1 1 2 million people , could starve to death . For many months now , the United States has been actively engaged in the massive international relief effort to ease Somalia s suffering . All told , America has sent Somalia 200 , 000 tons of food , more than half the world total . This summer , the distribution system broke down . Truck convoys from Somalia s ports were blocked . Sufficient food failed to reach the starving in the interior of Somalia . So in August , we took additional action . In concert with the United Nations , we sent in the Air Force to help fly food to the towns . To date , American pilots have flown over 1 , 400 flights , delivering over 17 , 000 tons of food aid . And when the authorized 3 , 500 guards to protect the relief operation , we flew in the first of them , 500 soldiers from Pakistan . But in the months since then , the security situation has grown worse . The has been prevented from deploying its initial commitment of troops . In many cases , food from relief flights is being looted upon landing food convoys have been hijacked aid workers assaulted ships with food have been subject to artillery attacks that prevented them from docking . There is no government in Somalia . Law and order have broken down . Anarchy prevails . One image tells the story . Imagine 7 , 000 tons of food aid literally bursting out of a warehouse on a dock in Mogadishu , while Somalis starve less than a kilometer away because relief workers cannot run the gauntlet of armed gangs roving the city . Confronted with these conditions , relief groups called for outside troops to provide security so they could feed people . It is now clear that military support is necessary to ensure the safe delivery of the food Somalis need to survive . It was this situation which led us to tell the United Nations that the United States would be willing to provide more help to enable relief to be delivered . Last night the United Nations Security Council , by unanimous vote and after the tireless efforts of Secretary General Boutros Ghali , welcomed the United States offer to lead a coalition to get the food through . After consulting with my advisers , with world leaders , and the congressional leadership , I have today told Secretary General Boutros Ghali that America will answer the call . I have given the order to Secretary Cheney to move a substantial American force into Somalia . As I speak , a Marine amphibious ready group , which we maintain at sea , is offshore Mogadishu . These troops will be joined by elements of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force , based out of Camp Pendleton , California , and by the Army s 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum , New York . These and other American forces will assist in Operation Restore Hope . They are America s finest . They will perform this mission with courage and compassion , and they will succeed . The people of Somalia , especially the children of Somalia , need our help . We are able to ease their suffering . We must help them live . We must give them hope . America must act . In taking this action , I want to emphasize that I understand the United States alone cannot right the world s wrongs . But we also know that some crises in the world cannot be resolved without American involvement , that American action is often necessary as a catalyst for broader involvement of the community of nations . Only the United States has the global reach to place a large security force on the ground in such a distant place quickly and efficiently and thus save thousands of innocents from death . We will not , however , be acting alone . I expect forces from about a dozen countries to join us in this mission . When we see Somalia s children starving , all of America hurts . We have tried to help in many ways . And make no mistake about it , now we and our allies will ensure that aid gets through . Here is what we and our coalition partners will do First , we will create a secure environment in the hardest hit parts of Somalia , so that food can move from ships over land to the people in the countryside now devastated by starvation . Second , once we have created that secure environment , we will withdraw our troops , handing the security mission back to a regular peacekeeping force . Our mission has a limited objective To open the supply routes , to get the food moving , and to prepare the way for a peacekeeping force to keep it moving . This operation is not open ended . We will not stay one day longer than is absolutely necessary . Let me be very clear Our mission is humanitarian , but we will not tolerate armed gangs ripping off their own people , condemning them to death by starvation . General Hoar and his troops have the authority to take whatever military action is necessary to safeguard the lives of our troops and the lives of Somalia s people . The outlaw elements in Somalia must understand this is serious business . We will accomplish our mission . We have no intent to remain in Somalia with fighting forces , but we are determined to do it right , to secure an environment that will allow food to get to the starving people of Somalia . To the people of Somalia I promise this We do not plan to dictate political outcomes . We respect your sovereignty and independence . Based on my conversations with other coalition leaders , I can state with confidence We come to your country for one reason only , to enable the starving to be fed . Let me say to the men and women of our Armed Forces We are asking you to do a difficult and dangerous job . As Commander in Chief I assure you , you will have our full support to get the job done , and we will bring you home as soon as possible . Finally , let me close with a message to the families of the men and women who take part in this mission I understand it is difficult to see your loved ones go , to send them off knowing they will not be home for the holidays , but the humanitarian mission they undertake is in the finest traditions of service . So , to every sailor , soldier , airman , and marine who is involved in this mission , let me say , you are doing God s work . We will not fail . Thank you , and may God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>President and Speaker and Members of the United States Congress , distinguished guests , fellow Americans , thank you very much for that warm welcome . We gather tonight , witness to events in the Persian Gulf as significant as they are tragic . In the early morning hours of August 2d , following negotiations and promises by Iraq s dictator Saddam Hussein not to use force , a powerful Iraqi army invaded its trusting and much weaker neighbor , Kuwait . Within 3 days , 120 , 000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia . It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression . At this moment , our brave servicemen and women stand watch in that distant desert and on distant seas , side by side with the forces of more than 20 other nations . They are some of the finest men and women of the United States of America . And they are doing one terrific job . These valiant Americans were ready at a moment s notice to leave their spouses and their children , to serve on the front line halfway around the world . They remind us who keeps America strong they do . In the trying circumstances of the Gulf , the morale of our service men and women is excellent . In the face of danger , they are brave , they are well trained , and dedicated . A soldier , Private First Class Wade Merritt of Knoxville , Tennessee , now stationed in Saudi Arabia , wrote his parents of his worries , his love of family , and his hope for peace . But Wade also wrote , I am proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane aggression . I am proud of my army and its men . I am proud to serve my country . Well , let me just say , Wade , America is proud of you and is grateful to every soldier , sailor , marine , and airman serving the cause of peace in the Persian Gulf . I also want to thank the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Powell the Chiefs here tonight our commander in the Persian Gulf , General Schwartzkopf and the men and women of the Department of Defense . What a magnificent job you all are doing . And thank you very , very much from a grateful people . I wish I could say that their work is done . But we all know it is not . So , if there ever was a time to put country before self and patriotism before party , the time is now . And let me thank all Americans , especially those here in this Chamber tonight , for your support for our armed forces and for their mission . That support will be even more important in the days to come . So , tonight I want to talk to you about what is at stake what we must do together to defend civilized values around the world and maintain our economic strength at home . Our objectives in the Persian Gulf are clear , our goals defined and familiar Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely , immediately , and without condition . Kuwait is legitimate government must be restored . The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured . And American citizens abroad must be protected . These goals are not ours alone . They have been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council five times in as many weeks . Most countries share our concern for principle . And many have a stake in the stability of the Persian Gulf . This is not , as Saddam Hussein would have it , the United States against Iraq . It is Iraq against the world . As you know , I have just returned from a very productive meeting with Soviet President Gorbachev . And I am pleased that we are working together to build a new relationship . In Helsinki , our joint statement affirmed to the world our shared resolve to counter Iraq s threat to peace . Let me quote We are united in the belief that Iraq s aggression must not be tolerated . No peaceful international order is possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors . Clearly , no longer can a dictator count on East West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression . A new partnership of nations has begun . We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment . The crisis in the Persian Gulf , as grave as it is , also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation . Out of these troubled times , our fifth objective a new world order can emerge a new era freer from the threat of terror , stronger in the pursuit of justice , and more secure in the quest for peace . An era in which the nations of the world , East and West , North and South , can prosper and live in harmony . A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace , while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor . Today that new world is struggling to be born , a world quite different from the one we have known . A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle . A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice . A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak . This is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki . He and other leaders from Europe , the Gulf , and around the world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come . The test we face is great , and so are the stakes . This is the first assault on the new world that we seek , the first test of our mettle . Had we not responded to this first provocation with clarity of purpose , if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination , it would be a signal to actual and potential despots around the world . America and the world must defend common vital interests and we will . America and the world must support the rule of law and we will . America and the world must stand up to aggression and we will . And one thing more In the pursuit of these goals America will not be intimidated . Vital issues of principle are at stake . Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the Earth . We do not exaggerate . Nor do we exaggerate when we say Saddam Hussein will fail . Vital economic interests are at risk as well . Iraq itself controls some 10 percent of the world s proven oil reserves . Iraq plus Kuwait controls twice that . An Iraq permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power , as well as the arrogance , to intimidate and coerce its neighbors neighbors who control the lion s share of the world s remaining oil reserves . We cannot permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless . And we will not . Recent events have surely proven that there is no substitute for American leadership . In the face of tyranny , let no one doubt American credibility and reliability . Let no one doubt our staying power . We will stand by our friends . One way or another , the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth . From the outset , acting hand in hand with others , we have sought to fashion the broadest possible international response to Iraq s aggression . The level of world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented . Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at the request of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and , if need be , to defend against attack . Moslems and non Moslems , Arabs and non Arabs , soldiers from many nations stand shoulder to shoulder , resolute against Saddam Hussein s ambitions . We can now point to five United Nations Security Council resolutions that condemn Iraq s aggression . They call for Iraq s immediate and unconditional withdrawal , the restoration of Kuwait is legitimate government , and categorically reject Iraq s cynical and self serving attempt to annex Kuwait . Finally , the United Nations has demanded the release of all foreign nationals held hostage against their will and in contravention of international law . It is a mockery of human decency to call these people guests . They are hostages , and the whole world knows it . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , a dependable ally , said it all We do not bargain over hostages . We will not stoop to the level of using human beings as bargaining chips ever . Of course , of course , our hearts go out to the hostages and to their families . But our policy cannot change , and it will not change . America and the world will not be blackmailed by this ruthless policy . We are now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders . We owe much to the outstanding leadership of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar . The United Nations is backing up its words with action . The Security Council has imposed mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq , designed to force Iraq to relinquish the spoils of its illegal conquest . The Security Council has also taken the decisive step of authorizing the use of all means necessary to ensure compliance with these sanctions . Together with our friends and allies , ships of the United States Navy are today patrolling Mideast waters . They have already intercepted more than 700 ships to enforce the sanctions . Three regional leaders I spoke with just yesterday told me that these sanctions are working . Iraq is feeling the heat . We continue to hope that Iraq s leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them . They are cut off from world trade , unable to sell their oil . And only a tiny fraction of goods gets through . The communique with President Gorbachev made mention of what happens when the embargo is so effective that children of Iraq literally need milk or the sick truly need medicine . Then , under strict international supervision that guarantees the proper destination , then food will be permitted . At home , the material cost of our leadership can be steep . That is why Secretary of State Baker and Treasury Secretary Brady have met with many world leaders to underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be shared . We are prepared to do our share and more to help carry that load we insist that others do their share as well . The response of most of our friends and allies has been good . To help defray costs , the leaders of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and the UAE the United Arab Emirates have pledged to provide our deployed troops with all the food and fuel they need . Generous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front line nations , such as Turkey and Egypt . I am also heartened to report that this international response extends to the neediest victims of this conflict those refugees . For our part , we have contributed 28 million for relief efforts . This is but a portion of what is needed . I commend , in particular , Saudi Arabia , Japan , and several European nations who have joined us in this purely humanitarian effort . There is an energy related cost to be borne as well . Oil producing nations are already replacing lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output . More than half of what was lost has been made up . And we are getting superb cooperation . If producers , including the United States , continue steps to expand oil and gas production , we can stabilize prices and guarantee against hardship . Additionally , we and several of our allies always have the option to extract oil from our strategic petroleum reserves if conditions warrant . As I have pointed out before , conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible . And we must then take advantage of our energy sources across the board coal , natural gas , hydro , and nuclear . Our failure to do these things has made us more dependent on foreign oil than ever before . Finally , let no one even contemplate profiteering from this crisis . We will not have it . I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait . Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect . We will continue to review all options with our allies , but let it be clear we will not let this aggression stand . Our interest , our involvement in the Gulf is not transitory . It predated Saddam Hussein s aggression and will survive it . Long after all our troops come home and we all hope it is soon , very soon there will be a lasting role for the United States in assisting the nations of the Persian Gulf . Our role then to deter future aggression . Our role is to help our friends in their own self defense . And something else to curb the proliferation of chemical , biological , ballistic missile and , above all , nuclear technologies . Let me also make clear that the United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people . Our quarrel is with Iraq s dictator and with his aggression . Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait . That is not a threat , that is not a boast , that is just the way it is going to be . Our ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we conduct ourselves at home . Our economy , our Armed Forces , our energy dependence , and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friends and stand up to our foes . For America to lead , America must remain strong and vital . Our world leadership and domestic strength are mutual and reinforcing a woven piece , strongly bound as Old Glory . To revitalize our leadership , our leadership capacity , we must address our budget deficit not after election day , or next year , but now . Higher oil prices slow our growth , and higher defense costs would only make our fiscal deficit problem worse . That deficit was already greater than it should have been a projected 232 billion for the coming year . It must it will be reduced . To my friends in Congress , together we must act this very month before the next fiscal year begins on October 1st to get America s economic house in order . The Gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than we ever should be . Americans must never again enter any crisis , economic or military , with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive burden of Federal debt . Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the Congress and between the branches over budget matters . It is high time we pulled together and get the job done right . It is up to us to straighten this out . This job has four basic parts . First , the Congress should , this month , within a budget agreement , enact growth oriented tax measures to help avoid recession in the short term and to increase savings , investment , productivity , and competitiveness for the longer term . These measures include extending incentives for research and experimentation expanding the use of IRA s for new homeowners establishing tax deferred family savings accounts creating incentives for the creation of enterprise zones and initiatives to encourage more domestic drilling and , yes , reducing the tax rate on capital gains . And second , the Congress should , this month , enact a prudent multiyear defense program , one that reflects not only the improvement in East West relations but our broader responsibilities to deal with the continuing risks of outlaw action and regional conflict . Even with our obligations in the Gulf , a sound defense budget can have some reduction in real terms and we are prepared to accept that . But to go beyond such levels , where cutting defense would threaten our vital margin of safety , is something I will never accept . The world is still dangerous . And surely , that is now clear . Stability s not secure . American interests are far reaching . Interdependence has increased . The consequences of regional instability can be global . This is no time to risk America s capacity to protect her vital interests . And third , the Congress should , this month , enact measures to increase domestic energy production and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil . These measures should include my proposals to increase incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration , fuel switching , and to accelerate the development of the Alaskan energy resources without damage to wildlife . As you know , when the oil embargo was imposed in the early 1970 s , the United States imported almost 6 million barrels of oil a day . This year , before the Iraqi invasion , imports had risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day . And we had moved in the wrong direction . And now we must act to correct that trend . And fourth , the Congress should , this month , enact a 5 year program to reduce the projected debt and deficits by 500 billion that is by half a trillion dollars . And if , with the Congress , we can develop a satisfactory program by the end of the month , we can avoid the ax of sequester deep across the board cuts that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic disruption . I want to be able to tell the American people that we have truly solved the deficit problem . And for me to do that , a budget agreement must meet these tests It must include the measures I have recommended to increase economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil . It must be fair . All should contribute , but the burden should not be excessive for any one group of programs or people . It must address the growth of government s hidden liabilities . It must reform the budget process and , further , it must be real . I urge Congress to provide a comprehensive 5 year deficit reduction program to me as a complete legislative package , with measures to assure that it can be fully enforced . America is tired of phony deficit reduction or promise now , save later plans . It is time for a program that is credible and real . And finally , to the extent that the deficit reduction program includes new revenue measures , it must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth or turn us back toward the days of punishing income tax rates . That is one path we should not head down again . I have been pleased with recent progress , although it has not always seemed so smooth . But now it is time to produce . I hope we can work out a responsible plan . But with or without agreement from the budget summit , I ask both Houses of the Congress to allow a straight up or down vote on a complete 500 billion deficit reduction package not later than September 28 . If the Congress cannot get me a budget , then Americans will have to face a tough , mandated sequester . I am hopeful , in fact , I am confident that the Congress will do what it should . And I can assure you that we in the executive branch will do our part . In the final analysis , our ability to meet our responsibilities abroad depends upon political will and consensus at home . This is never easy in democracies , for we govern only with the consent of the governed . And although free people in a free society are bound to have their differences , Americans traditionally come together in times of adversity and challenge . Once again , Americans have stepped forward to share a tearful goodbye with their families before leaving for a strange and distant shore . At this very moment , they serve together with Arabs , Europeans , Asians , and Africans in defense of principle and the dream of a new world order . That is why they sweat and toil in the sand and the heat and the sun . If they can come together under such adversity , if old adversaries like the Soviet Union and the United States can work in common cause , then surely we who are so fortunate to be in this great Chamber Democrats , Republicans , liberals , conservatives can come together to fulfill our responsibilities here . Thank you . Good night . And God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>In the life of a nation , we are called upon to define who we are and what we believe . Sometimes these choices are not easy . But today as President , I ask for your support in a decision I have made to stand up for what is right and condemn what is wrong , all in the cause of peace . At my direction , elements of the 82d Airborne Division as well as key units of the United States Air Force are arriving today to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia . I took this action to assist the Saudi Arabian Government in the defense of its homeland . No one commits America s Armed Forces to a dangerous mission lightly , but after perhaps unparalleled international consultation and exhausting every alternative , it became necessary to take this action . Let me tell you why . Less than a week ago , in the early morning hours of August 2d , Iraqi Armed Forces , without provocation or warning , invaded a peaceful Kuwait . Facing negligible resistance from its much smaller neighbor , Iraq s tanks stormed in blitzkrieg fashion through Kuwait in a few short hours . With more than 100 , 000 troops , along with tanks , artillery , and surface to surface missiles , Iraq now occupies Kuwait . This aggression came just hours after Saddam Hussein specifically assured numerous countries in the area that there would be no invasion . There is no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and brutal act of aggression . A puppet regime imposed from the outside is unacceptable . The acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable . No one , friend or foe , should doubt our desire for peace and no one should underestimate our determination to confront aggression . Four simple principles guide our policy . First , we seek the immediate , unconditional , and complete withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait . Second , Kuwait is legitimate government must be restored to replace the puppet regime . And third , my administration , as has been the case with every President from President Roosevelt to President Reagan , is committed to the security and stability of the Persian Gulf . And fourth , I am determined to protect the lives of American citizens abroad . Immediately after the Iraqi invasion , I ordered an embargo of all trade with Iraq and , together with many other nations , announced sanctions that both freeze all Iraqi assets in this country and protected Kuwait is assets . The stakes are high . Iraq is already a rich and powerful country that possesses the world s second largest reserves of oil and over a million men under arms . It is the fourth largest military in the world . Our country now imports nearly half the oil it consumes and could face a major threat to its economic independence . Much of the world is even more dependent upon imported oil and is even more vulnerable to Iraqi threats . We succeeded in the struggle for freedom in Europe because we and our allies remain stalwart . Keeping the peace in the Middle East will require no less . We are beginning a new era . This new era can be full of promise , an age of freedom , a time of peace for all peoples . But if history teaches us anything , it is that we must resist aggression or it will destroy our freedoms . Appeasement does not work . As was the case in the 1930 s , we see in Saddam Hussein an aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors . Only 14 days ago , Saddam Hussein promised his friends he would not invade Kuwait . And 4 days ago , he promised the world he would withdraw . And twice we have seen what his promises mean His promises mean nothing . In the last few days , I have spoken with political leaders from the Middle East , Europe , Asia , and the Americas and I have met with Prime Minister Thatcher , Prime Minister Mulroney , and NATO Secretary General Woerner . And all agree that Iraq cannot be allowed to benefit from its invasion of Kuwait . We agree that this is not an American problem or a European problem or a Middle East problem It is the world s problem . And that is why , soon after the Iraqi invasion , the United Nations Security Council , without dissent , condemned Iraq , calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its troops from Kuwait . The Arab world , through both the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council , courageously announced its opposition to Iraqi aggression . Japan , the United Kingdom , and France , and other governments around the world have imposed severe sanctions . The Soviet Union and China ended all arms sales to Iraq . And this past Monday , the United Nations Security Council approved for the first time in 23 years mandatory sanctions under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter . These sanctions , now enshrined in international law , have the potential to deny Iraq the fruits of aggression while sharply limiting its ability to either import or export anything of value , especially oil . I pledge here today that the United States will do its part to see that these sanctions are effective and to induce Iraq to withdraw without delay from Kuwait . But we must recognize that Iraq may not stop using force to advance its ambitions . Iraq has massed an enormous war machine on the Saudi border capable of initiating hostilities with little or no additional preparation . Given the Iraqi government s history of aggression against its own citizens as well as its neighbors , to assume Iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic . And therefore , after consulting with King Fahd , I sent Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to discuss cooperative measures we could take . Following those meetings , the Saudi Government requested our help , and I responded to that request by ordering air and ground forces to deploy to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Let me be clear The sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital interest to the United States . This decision , which I shared with the congressional leadership , grows out of the longstanding friendship and security relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia . forces will work together with those of Saudi Arabia and other nations to preserve the integrity of Saudi Arabia and to deter further Iraqi aggression . Through their presence , as well as through training and exercises , these multinational forces will enhance the overall capability of Saudi Armed Forces to defend the Kingdom . I want to be clear about what we are doing and why . America does not seek conflict , nor do we seek to chart the destiny of other nations . But America will stand by her friends . The mission of our troops is wholly defensive . Hopefully , they will not be needed long . They will not initiate hostilities , but they will defend themselves , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , and other friends in the Persian Gulf . We are working around the clock to deter Iraqi aggression and to enforce sanctions . I am continuing my conversations with world leaders . Secretary of Defense Cheney has just returned from valuable consultations with President Mubarak of Egypt and King Hassan of Morocco . Secretary of State Baker has consulted with his counterparts in many nations , including the Soviet Union , and today he heads for Europe to consult with President Ozal of Turkey , a staunch friend of the United States . And he will then consult with the NATO Foreign Ministers . I will ask oil producing nations to do what they can to increase production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reductions will have on the world economy . And I will explore whether we and our allies should draw down our strategic petroleum reserves . Conservation measures can also help Americans everywhere must do their part . And one more thing I am asking the oil companies to do their fair share . They should show restraint and not abuse today s uncertainties to raise prices . Standing up for our principles will not come easy . It may take time and possibly cost a great deal . But we are asking no more of anyone than of the brave young men and women of our Armed Forces and their families . And I ask that in the churches around the country prayers be said for those who are committed to protect and defend America s interests . Standing up for our principle is an American tradition . As it has so many times before , it may take time and tremendous effort , but most of all , it will take unity of purpose . As I have witnessed throughout my life in both war and peace , America has never wavered when her purpose is driven by principle . And in this August day , at home and abroad , I know she will do no less . Thank you , and God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you all for that welcome back . Thank you very , very much . Good afternoon , everybody , and thank you all . I knew if I wore this necktie I had get a nice welcome . But anyway Thank you , Mobley , thank you , Bill , for your kind introduction . May I salute Congressmen that are with us today , Congressman Joe Barton and Congressman Jack Fields and Commissioner Rick Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Ogden my old friend Fred McClure , who served at my side in the White House . And may I thank Chairman Ross Margraves for the wonderful program that he arranged for me today as I heard about this library . And I salute the board of regents members that are here the members of the library committee Chancellor Richardson , I think I mentioned , but I salute him . I want to say thanks to my hosts , the Memorial Student Center Political Forum . When that forum started , I think Congressman Bob Eckhardt and I were the first two speakers to speak at the political forum . I had hate to tell you how far back that was . But anyway , I am glad to be back here . And may I send my heartiest thanks to the corps of cadets and the fightin Texas Aggies band over here . As I told Bill Mobley and Ross earlier , on a personal note , I am looking forward to spending more time here , to actively participating in our Presidential library that will be built here , to helping with the School of Public Service that will be part of that library . And Barbara and I are both looking forward to being part of the A and M family . Thank you very much . Now for the business at hand . In 36 days , I will hand over the stewardship of this great Nation , capping a career in public service that began 50 years ago in wartime skies over the Pacific . And our country won that great contest but entered an uneasy peace . You see , the fires of World War II cooled into a longer cold war , one that froze the world into two opposing camps on the one side , America and its allies , and on the other the forces of freedom thus against an alien ideology that cast its shadow over every American . Three years ago when I was honored to address the graduating class here at Texas A and I spoke of the need to move beyond containment . And I said , We seek the integration of the Soviet Union into the community of nations . Ultimately , our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back into the world order . And was this aim too ambitious Not for the American people . Today , by the grit of our people and the grace of God , the Cold War is over . Freedom has carried the day . And I leave the White House grateful for what we have achieved together and also exhilarated by the promise of what can come to pass . This afternoon I would like to just share some of my thoughts on the past few years and on America s purpose in the world . My thesis is a simple one . Amid the triumph and the tumult of the recent past , one truth rings out more clearly than ever America remains today what Lincoln said it was more than a century ago , the last best hope of man on Earth . This is a fact , a truth made indelible by the struggles and the agonies of the 20th century and in the sacrifice symbolized by each towering oak on Simpson Drill Field here at Texas A and M University . The leadership , the power , and yes , the conscience of the United States of America , all are essential for a peaceful , prosperous international order , just as such an order is essential for us . History s lesson is clear When a war weary America withdrew from the international stage following World War the world spawned militarism , fascism , and aggression unchecked , plunging mankind into another devastating conflict . But in answering the call to lead after World War Iwe built from the principles of democracy and the rule of law a new community of free nations , a community whose strength , perseverance , patience , and unity of purpose contained Soviet totalitarianism and kept the peace . In the end , Soviet communism provided no match for free enterprise beyond its borders or the yearning for liberty within them . And the American leadership that undermined the confidence and capacity of the Communist regimes became a beacon for all the peoples of the world . Steadfast and sure , generations of Americans stood in the path of the Soviet advance while our adversary probed for weaknesses that were never found . Presidents from both parties led an Atlantic alliance held together by the bonds of principle and love of liberty , facing a Warsaw Pact lashed together by occupation troops and quisling governments and , when all else failed , the use of tanks against its own people . By the 1980 s , Kremlin leaders found that our alliance would not crack when they threatened America s allies with the infamous SS 20 nuclear missile . Nor did the alliance shrink from the deployment of countervailing missiles to defend against this menace . In the Pacific , too , we built a new alliance with Japan , defended Korea , and called hundreds of thousands of Americans to sacrifice in the jungles of Southeast Asia . The American people demonstrated that they would shoulder whatever defense burden , make whatever sacrifice was needed to assure our freedom and protect our allies and interests . And we made use of this superb technology that our free enterprise system has produced . And having learned that they could not divide our alliance , the Soviets eventually were forced to realize that their command economy simply could not compete . As the Soviet system stalled and crumbled , so too did the ability of its rulers to deny their people the truth , about us and about them . In the end , Soviet communism was destroyed by its own internal contradictions . New leaders with new vision faced the hard truths that their predecessors had long denied . Glasnost , perestroika They may have been Russian words , but the concepts at their core were universal . The Soviet Union did not simply lose the cold war the Western democracies won it . I say this not to gloat but to make a key point . The qualities that enabled us to triumph in that struggle , faith , strength , unity , and above all , American leadership , are those we must call upon now to win the peace . In recent years , with the Soviet empire in its death throes , the potential for crisis and conflict was never greater , the demand for American leadership never more compelling . As the peoples of Eastern Europe made their bold move for freedom , we urged them along a peaceful path to liberation . They turned to us . They turned to America , and we did not turn away . And when our German friends took their hammers to tear down that wall , we encouraged a united Germany , safely within the NATO alliance . They looked to America , and we did not look away . And when the people of Russia blocked the tanks that tried to roll back the tide of history , America did not walk away . I can remember speaking to Boris Yeltsin at that terrible moment of crisis . At times the static on the telephone made it almost impossible to hear him , but there was no mistaking what he wanted to know . He asked where the United States of America stood . And America answered , for all the world to hear , We stand with you . Boris Yeltsin to this day has not forgotten . Praising our country on his visit to the White House this June , he said George Bush was the first to understand the true scope and meaning of the victory of the Russian people on August 19 , 1991 . He addressed me , but he was talking about our country , the United States of America . The free peoples of the world watched they watched in awe as the Soviet Union collapsed , but they held their breath at what might take its place , wondering who might control its tens of thousands of nuclear weapons . Only America could manage that danger . We acted decisively to help the new leaders reduce their arsenals and gain firm control of those that remain . Here , then , is the remarkable fact that history will record , a fact that will be studied for years in the library right here at Texas A and M University The end of a titanic clash of political systems , the collapse of the most heavily armed empire in history , took place without a shot being fired . That should be a source of pride for every American . From the days after World War Iwhen fragile European democracies were threatened by Stalin s expansionism , to the last days of the cold war , as our foes became fragile democracies themselves , American leadership has been indispensable . No one person deserves credit for this . America does . It has been achieved because of what we as a people stand for and what we are made of . Yes , we answered the call , and we triumphed , but today we are summoned again . This time we are called not to wage a war , hot or cold , but to win the democratic peace , not for half a world as before but for people the world over . The end of the cold war , you see , has placed in our hands a unique opportunity to see the principles for which America has stood for two centuries , democracy , free enterprise , and the rule of law , spread more widely than ever before in human history . For the first time , turning this global vision into a new and better world is , indeed , a realistic possibility . It is a hope that embodies our country s tradition of idealism , which has made us unique among nations and uniquely successful . And our vision is not mere utopianism . The advance of democratic ideals reflects a hard nosed sense of our own , of American self interest . For certain truths have , indeed , now become evident Governments responsive to the will of the people are not likely to commit aggression . They are not likely to sponsor terrorism or to threaten humanity with weapons of mass destruction . Likewise , the global spread of free markets , by encouraging trade , investment , and growth , will sustain the expansion of American prosperity . In short , by helping others , we help ourselves . Some will dismiss this vision as no more than a dream . I ask them to consider the last 4 years when a dozen dreams were made real The Berlin Wall demolished and Germany united the captive nations set free Russia democratic whole classes of nuclear weapons eliminated , the rest vastly reduced many nations united in our historic coalition to turn back a tyrant in the Persian Gulf Israel and its Arab neighbors for the first time talking peace , face to face , in a region that has known so much war . Each of these once seemed a dream . Today they are concrete realities , brought about by a common cause the patient and judicious application of American leadership , American power , and perhaps most of all , American moral force . Without a doubt , there is going to be serious obstacles and setbacks ahead . You know and I know that we face some already . Violence , poverty , ethnic and religious hatreds will be powerful adversaries . And overcoming them is going to take time , and it is going to take tenacity , courage , and commitment . But I am absolutely convinced that they can be overcome . Look to Europe , where nations , after centuries of war , transformed themselves into a peaceful , progressive community . No society , no continent should be disqualified from sharing the ideals of human liberty . The community of democratic nations is more robust then ever , and it will gain strength as it grows . By working with our allies , by invigorating our international institutions , America does not have to stand alone . Yet from some quarters we hear voices sounding the retreat . We have carried the burden too long , they say , and the disappearance of the Soviet challenge means that America can withdraw from international responsibilities . And then others assert that domestic needs preclude an active foreign policy , that we have done our part now it is someone else s turn . We are warned against entangling ourselves in the troubles that abound in today s world , to name only a few clan warfare , mass starvation in Somalia savage violence in Bosnia instability in the former Soviet Union the alarming growth of virulent nationalism . It is true , these problems some frozen by the cold war , others held in check by Communist repression seem to have ignited all at once , taxing the world s ability to respond . But let us be clear The alternative to American leadership is not more security for our citizens but less , not the flourishing of American principles but their isolation in a world actively held hostile to them . Destiny , it has been said , is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice . It is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved . And we can never safely assume that our future will be an improvement over the past . Our choice as a people is simple We can either shape our times , or we can let the times shape us . And shape us they will , at a price frightening to contemplate , morally , economically , and strategically . Morally , a failure to respond to massive human catastrophes like that in Somalia would scar the soul of our Nation . There can be no single or simple set of guidelines for foreign policy . We should help . But we should consider using military force only in those situations where the stakes warrant , where it can be effective and its application limited in scope and time . As we seek to save lives , we must always be mindful of the lives that we may have to put at risk . Economically , a world of escalating instability and hostile nationalism will disrupt global markets , set off trade wars , set us on a path of economic decline . American jobs would be lost , our chance to compete would be blocked , and our very well being would be undermined . Strategically , abandonment of the worldwide democratic revolution could be disastrous for American security . The alternative to democracy , I think we would all agree , is authoritarianism regimes that can be repressive , xenophobic , aggressive , and violent . And in a world where , despite efforts , weapons of mass destruction are spreading , the collapse of the democratic revolution could pose a direct threat to the safety of every single American . The new world could , in time , be as menacing as the old . And let me be blunt A retreat from American leadership , from American involvement , would be a mistake for which future generations , indeed our own children , would pay dearly . But we can influence the future . We can rededicate ourselves to the hard work of freedom . And this does not mean running off on reckless , expensive crusades . It does not mean bearing the world s burdens all alone . But it does mean leadership , economic , political , and yes , military , when our interests and values are at risk and where we can make a difference . And when we place our young men and women of the military in harm s way , we must be able to assure them and their families that their mission is defined and that its success can be achieved . It seems like ages ago that the people of Germany tore down that wall . But it is been only 3 years , and just over a year since the August coup was defeated by brave Russian democrats . And in this brief time , we have embarked on a new course through uncharted waters . The United States and its friends , old and new , have begun to define the post cold war reality . And we are already transforming the old network of alliances , institutions , and regimes to face the future . And those challenges must be met with collective action , led by the United States , to protect and promote our political , economic , and security values . Our foundation must be the democratic community that won the cold war . And we have begun to adapt America s political , economic , and defense relationships with Europe and Japan to ensure their vitality and strength in this new era , for these will continue to be essential partners in addressing the next generation of problems and opportunities . For example , we have begun to transform the Atlantic alliance , that bulwark against the Soviet threat , into a partnership with a more united Europe , a partnership primed to meet new security challenges in this age of uncertainty . And a new feature of our alliance , the North Atlantic Cooperation Council , enables NATO to reach out to our former adversaries in the Warsaw Pact . In the Pacific , we have affirmed the importance of the S . Japan security ties to stability in Asia . But we are also exploring ways to work together as global partners to address common interests in economics , development , and regional problems . Then we have committed ourselves to expanding the democratic community by supporting political and economic freedom in nascent democracies and market economies . And we are sharing this burden with the very nations America helped after World War II . Look , in Central and Eastern Europe , our enterprise funds and these other programs have helped develop a new political , economic , and civic infrastructure for nations long oppressed by Stalin s legacy . And now the FREEDOM Support Act will provide crucial help for reform in the lands of our former enemies . In Latin America , the day of the dictator has given way to the dawn of democracy . This very day , our Vice President is taking part in a ceremony in El Salvador that caps the long effort to end the killing and give the people there the opportunity to live in peace . Throughout the region , economic initiatives are helping a new generation of leaders reform their societies . The Brady plan and our Enterprise for the Americas Initiative have opened up extraordinary possibilities for a new relationship with our hemispheric neighbors . Investment , free trade , debt relief , and environmental protection will nurture the homegrown reforms throughout Latin America . We are strengthening the ability of the democratic community to deal with the political landmines that the cold war has exposed aggressive nationalism , earlier I mentioned ethnic conflict , civil war , and humanitarian crises . The United States has led the world in supporting a United Nations more capable with dealing with these crises . All over the world , Nicaragua , Namibia , Angola , Cambodia , we have promoted elections not only as a goal but as a tool , a device for resolving conflicts and establishing political legitimacy . One of vital interest to every young person In the area of security and arms control , we have stepped up patrol against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . The new chemical weapons convention will ban chemical weapons from the arsenals of all participating states . We have strengthened multilateral export controls on nuclear and chemical and biological and missile related technologies . And in a mission without precedent , a inspection team is demolishing Iraq s unconventional weapons capability , and we are going to support them every inch of the way . And once implemented , the agreements we have negotiated will ban new nuclear states on the territory of the former Soviet Union . And above all , we have sought to erase nuclear nightmares from the sleep of future generations . We underscored one key security principle with a line in the sand Naked aggression against our vital interests will be answered decisively by American resolve , American leadership , and American might . Our victory in the Gulf , in the Persian Gulf , was more than a blow for justice it was a reminder to other would be aggressors that they will pay a price for their outlaw acts . We have been committed to building the basis for sustained international economic growth for ourselves and for those nations of what were once the so called second and third worlds . The heart of our efforts has been the creation of a stronger and freer international trading market . Our recent breakthrough with the European Community clears the way for an early conclusion to the Uruguay round of GATT and a major boost to world economic recovery . This week , Mexico , Canada , and the United States will sign a landmark agreement establishing the largest free trade zone the world has ever seen . And our efforts to forge a new mechanism for Asia Pacific economic cooperation confirm America s commitment to remain an economic and security power in Asia . I believe we have taken important steps toward a world in which democracy is the norm , in which private enterprise , free trade , and prosperity enrich every region , a world in which the rule of law prevails . We must not stumble as we travel toward a world without the brutal violence of Bosnia , the deadly anarchy of Somalia , or the squalor that still haunts so much of the globe . We cannot rest while a handful of renegade regimes aspire to obtain weapons of mass destruction with which to threaten their neighbors or even America . There is much to be done before we are within reach of the democratic peace . But these first steps have taken us in that right direction . The challenge ahead , then , is as great as the one we faced at the end of the last great war . But the opportunity is vastly greater . Success will require American vision and resolve , an America secure in its military , moral , and economic strength . Success will require unity of purpose a commitment on the part of all our people to the proposition that our Nation s destiny lies in the hope of a better world , a new world made better , with our friends and allies , again by American leadership . History is summoning us once again to lead . Proud of its past , America must once again look forward . And we must live up to the greatness of our forefathers ideals and in doing so secure our grandchildren s futures . And that is the cause that much of my public life has been dedicated to serving . Let me just say this in 36 hey listen come on now , you guys , as Barbara Bush would say . But in 36 days we will have a new President . And I am confident , I am very confident that he will do his level best to serve the cause that I have outlined here today . And he is going to have my support and he will have my support , and I will stay out of his way . And I really mean that . But it is more important than my support , it is more important that he have your support . You are our future . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America . Thank you all .<speech_sep>What I heard I liked . Once again , this might be an appropriate time for Barbara and me to thank the President and Gorbachev for this fantastic hospitality . And yes , I could not agree more about the productive nature of the talks , the enhancement of mutual understanding . This is not diplomatic language , in my view , this is fact . You know my views on the START agreement . Indeed , it is the culmination of a long and historic negotiation . And I happen to believe that the winners on this are the young people , not just in the Soviet Union , not just in the United States but all around the world . And we are taking major steps in transforming our economic relations . President Gorbachev touched on some of this . But we are going to send up the trade agreement to the Congress . We are going to grant most favored nation status now that the technicalities have been worked out . We have fulfilled thus our Malta goal , President , of normalizing our economic relationship . We agreed here to tackle the next challenge President Gorbachev talked about that furthering economic reform in the S . R . , and seeking to integrate the Soviet economy into the international system . We are going forward with space cooperation , cooperation in the environment . And we have several joint projects in mind there . Building on our historic cooperation during the Gulf crisis , we discussed the President and I discussed our partnership in resolving longstanding regional problems . As you mentioned , we are putting out statements on Yugoslavia , Central America . And , indeed , I want to comment now just briefly on the Middle East before taking your questions . We did reaffirm our mutual commitment to promote peace and genuine reconciliation between the Arab States , Israel , and the Palestinians . And we believe there is an historic opportunity right now to launch a process that can lead to a just and enduring peace and to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East . We share the strong conviction that this historic opportunity must not be lost . And while recognizing that peace cannot be imposed , it can only result from direct negotiations between the parties , the United States and the Soviet Union pledge to do their utmost to promote and sustain the peacemaking process . And to that end , the United States and the Soviet Union , acting as cosponsors , are going to work to convene an October peace conference designed to launch bilateral and multilateral negotiations . Invitations to the conference will be issued at least 10 days prior to the date the conference is to convene . And in the interim , Secretary Baker and Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh will continue to work with the parties to prepare for this conference . And I am today asking Secretary of State Jim Baker to return to the Middle East to obtain Israel s answer to our proposal for peace . And again , my thanks to you , and I had be prepared to take questions along with you , sir . Yugoslavia I would only add , sir , that inasmuch as that was a joint statement , that expresses our continued position as well . Well , I would wait and let Secretary Baker answer that question after this next meeting . And if I had to express a degree of optimism or pessimism , I had say I am a little more optimistic today . But the visit of Jim Baker now is for what we said here , to obtain Israel s answer to our proposal for peace . And if I had the answer in my pocket or he did I had expect that we would say so . I would only add to that , that though no date is set , it is my view and I have not always held this view that a meeting without an agenda is a good idea from time to time between the Soviet President and the President of the United States . And with this President Gorbachev talked about arms control and regional problems and other problems but as this dynamic autonomy begins to move , a chance for a dynamic economy here , there is going to be much more to talk about on the economic side than we have ever had before cooperation , partnerships , joint ventures . The whole approach to economics that he has endorsed that is going to benefit , I believe , the Soviet Union , and I think there is enormous potential for the United States . So , it is my view that we have got plenty to talk about . And for one , would be prepared to , as I have stated before , to have a meeting where there is not a crisis out there to be managed rather we can be sure that we are not two ships passing in the night the analogy I used , I believe , in Malta appropriately . And I look forward to future meetings because you get a lot done where you cannot put out sign a 3 point program or a 20 point protocol . But a lot is done just by the kinds of conversations we have had today . Well , I do not think there is a connection , but I do regret the violence . I listened to what President Gorbachev said about the discussion . We clearly favor negotiation he knows that that would lead to a reduction of cross border violence from both sides . And obviously , I had like to join in expressing my regrets to those families whose loved ones are lost . But the President immediately got on this and said they are conducting an investigation . I think there is hope that the investigation will be cooperative between the Lithuanian side and Byelorussia s side . And so , we cannot prejudge the incident , but I had an opportunity to express my views to President Gorbachev on the whole question of the Baltic States . I do not think it is fair to link a border incident before you know what happened to that question , however . Soviet Economic Integration Well , let me say that is a serious objective to start with . Secondly , I believe that active participation in these international financial institutions and the status that was deemed best by the G 7 is the most important thing that the Soviets can do right now . I have freed up , as you heard today , certain trade benefits or normalizing the trade procedures that , in my view , will help . And we have done that since the meeting in London . But the answer is , full participation full benefit of these international institutions require full knowledge and steps towards the privatization and toward convertability , all the things that I believe the Soviet Union wants . So , work with the international organizations and then bilaterally do what we have done and other countries will be doing , too , I am sure , to remove the underbrush , remove the barriers to bilateral economic cooperation . So , quite a bit has happened between us since Paris . And we look forward with our representatives in these international organizations to working very cooperatively with the Soviet leaders . The very fact that I would not suggest that a breakaway Republic is going to use a nuclear weapon against the United States , but I would suggest that we have every reason in the world to be concerned about renegades not in these areas , perhaps I hope not getting hold of nuclear weapons . And that is one of the reasons I strongly support our GPALS program that is being debated in the Senate right now . But in my view , other countries do possess nuclear weapons . It is not just the Soviet Union and the United States . And I do believe that we are on the right path by the path that President Gorbachev has outlined today on following on existing agreements . So , rather than try to have a ethereal or a utopian answer , let us follow through practically , as he suggested . And then as far as the is concerned , I had like us to go forward with a system that puts nobody at threat , nobody at risk . The only thing at risk is an errant nuclear missile aiming at a country . And that is why I support the defensive approach , and that is why I think one of the lessons out of the Iraq war and maybe President Gorbachev reads this differently is that defenses work . And though we are talking about a different concept now , an expanded concept , a more high tech concept , I think a lot of lives were saved by defense . So , that is my reply . What I heard I liked . Once again , this might be an appropriate time for Barbara and me to thank the President and Gorbachev for this fantastic hospitality . And yes , I could not agree more about the productive nature of the talks , the enhancement of mutual understanding . This is not diplomatic language , in my view , this is fact .

So , that is my reply .<speech_sep>My fellow citizens , last night I ordered military forces to Panama . No President takes such action lightly . This morning I want to tell you what I did and why I did it . For nearly 2 years , the United States , nations of Latin America and the Caribbean have worked together to resolve the crisis in Panama . The goals of the United States have been to safeguard the lives of Americans , to defend democracy in Panama , to combat drug trafficking , and to protect the integrity of the Panama Canal treaty . Many attempts have been made to resolve this crisis through diplomacy and negotiations . All were rejected by the dictator of Panama , General Manuel Noriega , an indicted drug trafficker . Last Friday , Noriega declared his military dictatorship to be in a state of war with the United States and publicly threatened the lives of Americans in Panama . The very next day , forces under his command shot and killed an unarmed American serviceman wounded another arrested and brutally beat a third American serviceman and then brutally interrogated his wife , threatening her with sexual abuse . That was enough . General Noriega s reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in Panama created an imminent danger to the 35 , 000 American citizens in Panama . As President , I have no higher obligation than to safeguard the lives of American citizens . And that is why I directed our Armed Forces to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama and to bring General Noriega to justice in the United States . I contacted the bipartisan leadership of Congress last night and informed them of this decision , and after taking this action , I also talked with leaders in Latin America , the Caribbean , and those of other allies . At this moment , forces , including forces deployed from the United States last night , are engaged in action in Panama . The United States intends to withdraw the forces newly deployed to Panama as quickly as possible . Our forces have conducted themselves courageously and selflessly . And as Commander in Chief , I salute every one of them and thank them on behalf of our country . Tragically , some Americans have lost their lives in defense of their fellow citizens , in defense of democracy . And my heart goes out to their families . We also regret and mourn the loss of innocent Panamanians . The brave Panamanians elected by the people of Panama in the elections last May , President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Calderon and Ford , have assumed the rightful leadership of their country . You remember those horrible pictures of newly elected Vice President Ford , covered head to toe with blood , beaten mercilessly by so called dignity battalions . Well , the United States today recognizes the democratically elected government of President Endara . I will send our Ambassador back to Panama immediately . Key military objectives have been achieved . Most organized resistance has been eliminated , but the operation is not over yet General Noriega is in hiding . And nevertheless , yesterday a dictator ruled Panama , and today constitutionally elected leaders govern . I have today directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State to lift the economic sanctions with respect to the democratically elected government of Panama and , in cooperation with that government , to take steps to effect an orderly unblocking of Panamanian Government assets in the United States . I am fully committed to implement the Panama Canal treaties and turn over the Canal to Panama in the year 2000 . The actions we have taken and the cooperation of a new , democratic government in Panama will permit us to honor these commitments . As soon as the new government recommends a qualified candidate Panamanian to be Administrator of the Canal , as called for in the treaties , I will submit this nominee to the Senate for expedited consideration . I am committed to strengthening our relationship with the democratic nations in this hemisphere . I will continue to seek solutions to the problems of this region through dialog and multilateral diplomacy . I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of American citizens were in grave danger . I hope that the people of Panama will put this dark chapter of dictatorship behind them and move forward together as citizens of a democratic Panama with this government that they themselves have elected . The United States is eager to work with the Panamanian people in partnership and friendship to rebuild their economy . The Panamanian people want democracy , peace , and the chance for a better life in dignity and freedom . The people of the United States seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>I have many friends to thank tonight . I thank the voters who supported me . I thank the gallant men who entered the contest for the presidency this year , and who have honored me with their support . And , for their kind and stirring words , I thank Governor Tom Kean of New Jersey Senator Phil Gramm of Texas President Gerald Ford and my friend , President Ronald Reagan . I accept your nomination for President . I mean to run hard , to fight hard , to stand on the issues and I mean to win . There are a lot of great stories in politics about the underdog winning and this is going to be one of them . And we are going to win with the help of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana a young leader who has become a forceful voice in preparing America s workers for the labor force of the future . Born in the middle of the century , in the middle of America , and holding the promise of the future I am proud to have Dan Quayle at my side . Many of you have asked , When will this campaign really begin I have come to this hall to tell you , and to tell America Tonight is the night . For seven and a half years I have helped a President conduct the most difficult job on earth . Ronald Reagan asked for , and received , my candor . He never asked for , but he did receive , my loyalty . Those of you who saw the President s speech this week , and listened to the simple truth of his words , will understand my loyalty all these years . But now you must see me for what I am The Republican candidate for President of the United States . And now I turn to the American people to share my hopes and intentions , and why and where I wish to lead . And so tonight is for big things . But I will try to be fair to the other side . I will try to hold my charisma in check . I reject the temptation to engage in personal references . My approach this evening is , as Sergeant Joe Friday used to say , Just the facts , ma m . After all , the facts are on our side . I seek the presidency for a single purpose , a purpose that has motivated millions of Americans across the years and the ocean voyages . I seek the presidency to build a better America . It is that simple and that big . I am a man who sees life in terms of missions missions defined and missions completed . When I was a torpedo bomber pilot they defined the mission for us . Before we took off we all understood that no matter what , you try to reach the target . There have been other missions for me Congress , China , the CIBut I am here tonight and I am your candidate because the most important work of my life is to complete the mission we started in 1980 . How do we complete it We build it . The stakes are high this year and the choice is crucial , for the differences between the two candidates are as deep and wide as they have ever been in our long history . Not only two very different men , but two very different ideas of the future will be voted on this election day . What it all comes down to is this My opponent s view of the world sees a long slow decline for our country , an inevitable fall mandated by impersonal historical forces . But America is not a decline . America is a rising nation . He sees America as another pleasant country on the UN roll call , somewhere between Albania and Zimbabwe . I see America as the leader a unique nation with a special role in the world . This has been called the American Century , because in it we were the dominant force for good in the world . We saved Europe , cured polio , we went to the moon , and lit the world with our culture . Now we are on the verge of a new century , and what country s name will it bear I say it will be another American century . Our work is not done our force is not spent . There are those who say there is not much of a difference this year . But America , do not let em fool ya . Two parties this year ask for your support . Both will speak of growth and peace . But only one has proved it can deliver . Two parties this year ask for your trust , but only one has earned it . Eight years ago I stood here with Ronald Reagan and we promised , together , to break with the past and return America to her greatness . Eight years later look at what the American people have produced the highest level of economic growth in our entire history and the lowest level of world tensions in more than fifty years . Some say this is not an election about ideology , it is an election about competence . Well , it is nice of them to want to play on our field . But this election is not only about competence , for competence is a narrow ideal . Competence makes the trains run on time but does not know where they are going . Competence is the creed of the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but does not for a second understand the magic of the machine . The truth is , this election is about the beliefs we share , the values we honor , the principles we hold dear . But since someone brought up competence . . . . Consider the size of our triumph A record high percentage of Americans with jobs , a record high rate of new businesses a record high rate of real personal income . These are the facts . And one way you know our opponents know the facts is that to attack the record they have to misrepresent it . They call it a Swiss cheese economy . Well , that is the way it may look to the three blind mice . But when they were in charge it was all holes and no cheese . Inflation was 12 percent when we came in . We got it down to four . Interest rates were more than 21 . We cut them in half . Unemployment was up and climbing , now it is the lowest in 14 years . My friends , eight years ago this economy was flat on its back intensive care . We came in and gave it emergency treatment Got the temperature down by lowering regulation , got the blood pressure down when we lowered taxes . Pretty soon the patient was up , back on his feet , and stronger than ever . And now who do we hear knocking on the door but the doctors who made him sick . And they are telling us to put them in charge of the case again . My friends , they are lucky we do not hit them with a malpractice suit We have created 17 million new jobs in the past five years more than twice as many as Europe and Japan combined . And they are good jobs . The majority of them created in the past six years paid an average of more than 22 , 000 a year . Someone better take a message to Michael Tell him we have been creating good jobs at good wages . The fact is , they talk we deliver . They promise we perform . There are millions of young Americans in their 20 s who barely remember the days of gas lines and unemployment lines . Now they are marrying and starting careers . To those young people I say , You have the opportunity you deserve and I am not going to let them take it away from you . There are millions of older Americans who were brutalized by inflation . We arrested it and we are not going to let it out on furlough . We are going to keep the Social Security trust fund sound , and out of reach of the big spenders . To America s elderly I say , Once again you have the security that is your right and I am not going to let them take it away from you . I know the liberal democrats are worried about the economy . They are worried it is going to remain strong . And they are right , it is . With the right leadership . But let us be frank . Things are not perfect in this country . There are people who have not tasted the fruits of the expansion . I have talked to farmers about the bills they cannot pay . I have been to the factories that feel the strain of change . I have seen the urban children who play amidst the shattered glass and shattered lives . And there are the homeless . And you know , it does not do any good to debate endlessly which policy mistake of the 70 s is responsible . They are there . We have to help them . But what we must remember if we are to be responsible and compassionate is that economic growth is the key to our endeavors . I want growth that stays , that broadens , and that touches , finally , all Americans , form the hollows of Kentucky to the sunlit streets of Denver , from the suburbs of Chicago to the broad avenues of New York , from the oil fields of Oklahoma to the farms of the great plains . Can we do it Of course we can . We know how . We have done it . If we continue to grow at our current rate , we will be able to produce 30 million jobs in the next eight years . We will do it by maintaining our commitment to free and fair trade , by keeping government spending down , and by keeping taxes down . Our economic life is not the only test of our success , overwhelms all the others , and that is the issue of peace . One issue Look at the world on this bright August night . The spirit of Democracy is sweeping the Pacific rim . China feels the winds of change . New democracies assert themselves in South America . One by one the unfree places fall , not to the force of arms but to the force of an idea freedom works . We have a new relationship with the Soviet Union . The INF treaty the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan the beginning of the end of the Soviet proxy war in Angola , and with it the independence of Namibia . Iran and Iraq move toward peace . It is a watershed . It is no accident . It happened when we acted on the ancient knowledge that strength and clarity lead to peace weakness and ambivalence lead to war . Weakness and ambivalence lead to war . Weakness tempts aggressors . Strength stops them . I will not allow this country to be made weak again . The tremors in the Soviet world continue . The hard earth there has not yet settled . Perhaps what is happening will change our world forever . Perhaps what is happening will change our world forever . Perhaps not . A prudent skepticism is in order . And so is hope . Either way , we are in an unprecedented position to change the nature of our relationship . Not by preemptive concession but by keeping our strength . Not by yielding up defense systems with nothing won in return but by hard cool engagement in the tug and pull of diplomacy . My life has been lived in the shadow of war I almost lost my life in one . I hate war . I love peace . We have peace . And I am not going to let anyone take it away from us . Our economy is strong but not invulnerable , and the peace is broad but can be broken . And now we must decide . We will surely have change this year , but will it be change that moves us forward Or change that risks retreat In 1940 , when I was barely more than a boy , Franklin Roosevelt said we should not change horses in midstream . My friends , these days the world moves even more quickly , and now , after two great terms , a switch will be made . But when you have to change horses in midstream , does not it make sense to switch to the one who is going the same way An election that is about ideas and values is also about philosophy . And I have one . At the bright center is the individual . And radiating out from him or her is the family , the essential unit of closeness and of love . For it is the family that communicates to our children to the 21st century our culture , our religious faith , our traditions and history . From the individual to the family to the community , and on out to the town , to the church and school , and , still echoing out , to the county , the state , the nation each doing only what it does well , and no more . And I believe that power must always be kept close to the individual close to the hands that raise the family and run the home . I am guided by certain traditions . One is that there is a God and He is good , and his love , while free , has a self imposed cost We must be good to one another . I believe in another tradition that is , by now , embedded in the national soul . It is that learning is good in and of itself . The mothers of the Jewish ghettos of the east would pour honey on a book so the children would learn that learning is sweet . And the parents who settled hungry Kansas would take their children in from the fields when a teacher came . That is our history . And there is another tradition . And that is the idea of community a beautiful word with a big meaning . Though liberal democrats have an odd view of it . They see community as a limited cluster of interest groups , locked in odd conformity . In this view , the country waits passive while Washington sets the rules . But that is not what community means not to me . For we are a nation of communities , of thousands and tens of thousands of ethnic , religious , social , business , labor union , neighborhood , regional and other organizations , all of them varied , voluntary and unique . This is America the Knights of Columbus , the Grange , Hadassah , the Disabled American Veterans , the Order of Ahepa , the Business and Professional Women of America , the union hall , the Bible study group , LULA Holy Name a brilliant diversity spread like stars , like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky . Does government have a place Yes . Government is part of the nation of communities not the whole , just a part . I do not hate government . A government that remembers that the people are its master is a good and needed thing . I respect old fashioned common sense , and have no great love for the imaginings of social planners . I like what is been tested and found to be true . For instance Should public school teachers be required to lead our children in the pledge of allegiance My opponent says no but I say yes . Should society be allowed to impose the death penalty on those who commit crimes of extraordinary cruelty and violence My opponent says no but I say yes . Should our children have the right to say a voluntary prayer , or even observe a moment of silence in the schools My opponent says no but I say yes . Should free men and women have the right to own a gun to protect their home My opponent says no but I say yes . Is it right to believe in the sanctity of life and protect the lives of innocent children My opponent says no but I say yes . We must change from abortion to adoption . I have an adopted granddaughter . The day of her christening we wept with joy . I thank God her parents chose life . I am the one who believes it is a scandal to give a weekend furlough to a hardened first degree killer who has not even served enough time to be eligible for parole . I am the one who says a drug dealer who is responsible for the death of a policeman should be subject to capital punishment . I am the one who will not raise taxes . My opponent now says he will raise them as a last resort , or a third resort . When a politician talks like that , you know that is one resort he will be checking into . My opponent will not rule out raising taxes . But I will . The Congress will push me to raise taxes , and I will say no , and they will push , and I will say no , and they will push again , and I will say to them , Read my lips no new taxes . Let me tell you more about the mission . On jobs , my mission is 30 in 8 . Thirty million jobs in the next eight years . Every one of our children deserves a first rate school . The liberal democrats want power in the hands of the federal government . I want power in the hands of parents . I will increase the power of parents . I will encourage merit schools . I will give more kids a Head Start . And I will make it easier to save for college . I want a drug free America and this will not be easy to achieve . But I want to enlist the help of some people who are rarely included . Tonight I challenge the young people of our country to shut down the drug dealers around the world . Unite with us , work with us . Zero tolerance is not just a policy , it is an attitude . Tell them what you think of people who underwrite the dealers who put poison in our society . And while you are doing that , my administration will be telling the dealers whatever we have to do we will do , but your day is over , you are history . I am going to do whatever it takes to make sure the disabled are included in the mainstream . For too long they have been left out . But they are not going to be left out anymore . I am going to stop ocean dumping . Our beaches should not be garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools . I am going to have the FBI trace the medical wastes and we are going to punish the people who dump those infected needles into our oceans , lakes and rivers . And we must clean the air . We must reduce the harm done by acid rain . I will put incentives back into the domestic energy industry , for I know from personal experience there is no security for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil . In foreign affairs I will continue our policy of peace through strength . I will move toward further cuts in the strategic and conventional arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union . I will modernize and preserve our technological edge . I will ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth . And I intend to speak for freedom , stand for freedom , and be a patient friend to anyone , east or west , who will fight for freedom . It seems to me the Presidency provides an incomparable opportunity for gentle persuasion . I hope to stand for a new harmony , a greater tolerance . We have come far , but I think we need a new harmony among the races in our country . We are on a journey to a new century , and we have got to leave the tired old baggage of bigotry behind . Some people who are enjoying our prosperity have forgotten what it is for . But they diminish our triumph when they act as if wealth is an end in itself . There are those who have dropped their standards along the way , as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top . There is graft in city hall , the greed on Wall Street there is influence peddling in Washington , and the small corruptions of everyday ambition . But you see , I believe public service is honorable . And every time I hear someone has breached the public trust it breaks my heart . I wonder sometimes if we have forgotten who we are . But we are the people who sundered a nation rather than allow a sin called slavery we are the people who rose from the ghettos and the deserts . We were not saints but we lived by standards . We celebrated the individual but we were not self centered . We were practical but we did not live only for material things . We believed in getting ahead but blind ambition was not our way . The fact is prosperity has a purpose . It is to allow us to pursue the better angels , to give us time to think and grow . Prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making it concrete by certain acts of goodness . It means helping a child from an unhappy home learn how to read and I thank my wife Barbara for all her work in literacy . It means teaching troubled children through your presence that there is such a thing as reliable love . Some would say it is soft and insufficiently tough to care about these things . But where is it written that we must act as if we do not care , as if we are not moved Well I am moved . I want a kinder , gentler nation . Two men this year ask for your support . And you must know us . As for me , I have held high office and done the work of democracy day by day . My parents were prosperous their children were lucky . But there were lessons we had to learn about life . John Kennedy discovered poverty when he campaigned in West Virginia there were children there who had no milk . Young Teddy Roosevelt met the new America when he roamed the immigrant streets of New York . And I learned a few things about life in a place called Texas . We moved to west Texas 40 years ago . The war was over , and we wanted to get out and make it on our own . Those were exciting days . Lived in a little shotgun house , one room for the three of us . Worked in the oil business , started my own . In time we had six children . Moved from the shotgun to a duplex apartment to a house . Lived the dream high school football on Friday night , Little League , neighborhood barbecue . People do not see their experience as symbolic of an era but of course we were . So was everyone else who was taking a chance and pushing into unknown territory with kids and a dog and a car . But the big thing I learned is the satisfaction of creating jobs , which meant creating opportunity , which meant happy families , who in turn could do more to help others and enhance their own lives . I learned that the good done by a single good job can be felt in ways you cannot imagine . I may not be the most eloquent , but I learned early that eloquence will not draw oil from the ground . I may sometimes be a little awkward , but there is nothing self conscious in my love of country . I am a quiet man but I hear the quiet people others do not . The ones who raise the family , pay the taxes , meet the mortgage . I hear them and I am moved , and their concerns are mine . A President must be many things . He must be a shrewd protector of America s interests And he must be an idealist who leads those who move for a freer and more democratic planet . He must see to it that government intrudes as little as possible in the lives of the people and yet remember that it is the nation s character . And he must be able to define and lead a mission . For seven and a half years I have worked with a President and I have seen what crosses that big desk . I have seen the unexpected crisis that arrive in a cable in a young aide s hand . And I have seen problems that simmer on for decades and suddenly demand resolution . I have seen modest decisions made with anguish , and crucial decisions made with dispatch . And so I know that what it all comes down to , this election what it all comes down to , after all the shouting and the cheers is the man at the desk . My friends , I am that man . I say it without boast or bravado , I have fought for my country , I have served , I have built and I will go from the hills to the hollows , from the cities to the suburbs to the loneliest town on the quietest street to take our message of hope and growth for every American to every American . I will keep America moving forward , always forward for a better America , for an endless enduring dream and a thousand points of light . That is my mission . And I will complete it . Thank you . God bless you .<speech_sep>
