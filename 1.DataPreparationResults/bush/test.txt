President , thank you very much . Secretary General , distinguished delegates to the United Nations , it is really a great privilege to greet you today as we begin what marks a new and historic session of the General Assembly . My congratulations to the Honorable Guido De Marco on your election , sir , as President of the General Assembly . And on a personal note , I want to say that , having witnessed the unprecedented unity and cooperation of the past 2 months , that I have never been prouder to have once served within your ranks and never been prouder that the United States is the host country for the United Nations . Forty five years ago , while the fires of an epic war still raged across two oceans and two continents , a small group of men and women began a search for hope amid the ruins . And they gathered in San Francisco , stepping back from the haze and horror , to try to shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream . Intensely idealistic and yet tempered by war , they sought to build a new kind of bridge a bridge between nations , a bridge that might help carry humankind from its darkest hour to its brightest day . The founding of the United Nations embodied our deepest hopes for a peaceful world , and during the past year , we have come closer than ever before to realizing those hopes . We have seen a century sundered by barbed threats and barbed wire give way to a new era of peace and competition and freedom . The Revolution of 89 swept the world almost with a life of its own , carried by a new breeze of freedom . It transformed the political climate from Central Europe to Central America and touched almost every corner of the globe . That breeze has been sustained by a now almost universal recognition of a simple , fundamental truth The human spirit cannot be locked up forever . The truth is , people everywhere are motivated in much the same ways . And people everywhere want much the same things the chance to live a life of purpose the chance to choose a life in which they and their children can learn and grow healthy , worship freely , and prosper through the work of their hands and their hearts and their minds . We are not talking about the power of nations but the power of individuals , the power to choose , the power to risk , the power to succeed . This is a new and different world . Not since 1945 have we seen the real possibility of using the United Nations as it was designed as a center for international collective security . The changes in the Soviet Union have been critical to the emergence of a stronger United Nations . The S . Soviet relationship is finally beyond containment and confrontation , and now we seek to fulfill the promise of mutually shared understanding . The long twilight struggle that for 45 years has divided Europe , our two nations , and much of the world has come to an end . Much has changed over the last 2 years . The Soviet Union has taken many dramatic and important steps to participate fully in the community of nations . And when the Soviet Union agreed with so many of us here in the United Nations to condemn the aggression of Iraq , there could be no doubt no doubt then that we had , indeed , put four decades of history behind us . We are hopeful that the machinery of the United Nations will no longer be frozen by the divisions that plagued us during the cold war , that at last long last we can build new bridges and tear down old walls , that at long last we will be able to build a new world based on an event for which we have all hoped an end to the cold war . Two days from now , the world will be watching when the cold war is formally buried in Berlin . And in this time of testing , a fundamental question must be asked , a question not for any one nation but for the United Nations . And the question is this Can we work together in a new partnership of nations Can the collective strength of the world community , expressed by the United Nations , unite to deter and defeat aggression Because the cold war s battle of ideas is not the last epic battle of this century . Two months ago , in the waning weeks of one of history s most hopeful summers , the vast , still beauty of the peaceful Kuwaiti desert was fouled by the stench of diesel and the roar of steel tanks . Once again the sound of distant thunder echoed across a cloudless sky , and once again the world awoke to face the guns of August . But this time , the world was ready . The United Nations Security Council s resolute response to Iraq s unprovoked aggression has been without precedent . Since the invasion on August 2d , the Council has passed eight major resolutions setting the terms for a solution to the crisis . The Iraqi regime has yet to face the facts , but as I said last month , the annexation of Kuwait will not be permitted to stand . And this is not simply the view of the United States it is the view of every Kuwaiti , the Arab League , the United Nations . Iraq s leaders should listen It is Iraq against the world . Let me take this opportunity to make the policy of my government clear . The United States supports the use of sanctions to compel Iraq s leaders to withdraw immediately and without condition from Kuwait . We also support the provision of medicine and food for humanitarian purposes , so long as distribution can be properly monitored . Our quarrel is not with the people of Iraq . We do not wish for them to suffer . The world s quarrel is with the dictator who ordered that invasion . Along with others , we have dispatched military forces to the region to enforce sanctions , to deter and , if need be , defend against further aggression . And we seek no advantage for ourselves , nor do we seek to maintain our military forces in Saudi Arabia for 1 day longer than is necessary . forces were sent at the request of the Saudi Government , and the American people and this President want every single American soldier brought home as soon as this mission is completed . Let me also emphasize that all of us here at the hope that military force will never be used . We seek a peaceful outcome , a diplomatic outcome . And one more thing In the aftermath of Iraq s unconditional departure from Kuwait , I truly believe there may be opportunities for Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently , for the states of the Gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability , and for all the states and the peoples of the region to settle the conflicts that divide the Arabs from Israel . But the world s key task now , first and always must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be tolerated or rewarded . Through the Security Council , Iraq has been fairly judged by a jury of its peers , the very nations of the Earth . Today the regime stands isolated and out of step with the times , separated from the civilized world not by space but by centuries . Iraq s unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era , a dark relic from a dark time . It has plundered Kuwait . It has terrorized innocent civilians . It has held even diplomats hostage . Iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction . But this outrageous disregard for basic human rights does not come as a total surprise . Thousands of Iraqis have been executed on political and religious grounds , and even more through a genocidal poison gas war waged against Iraq s own Kurdish villagers . As a world community , we must act not only to deter the use of inhumane weapons like mustard and nerve gas but to eliminate the weapons entirely . And that is why , 1 year ago , I came to the General Assembly with new proposals to banish these terrible weapons from the face of the Earth . I promised that the United States would destroy over 98 percent of its stockpile in the first 8 years of a chemical weapons ban treaty , and 100 percent all of them in 10 years , if all nations with chemical capabilities , chemical weapons , signed the treaty . We have stood by those promises . In June the United States and the Soviet Union signed a landmark agreement to halt production and to destroy the vast majority of our stockpiles . Today chemical weapons are being destroyed . But time is running out . This is not merely a bilateral concern . The Gulf crisis proves how important it is to act together , and to act now , to conclude an absolute , worldwide ban on these weapons . We must also redouble our efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons , biological weapons , and the ballistic missiles that can rain destruction upon distant peoples . The United Nations can help bring about a new day , a day when these kinds of terrible weapons and the terrible despots who would use them are both a thing of the past . It is in our hands to leave these dark machines behind , in the Dark Ages where they belong , and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a new world order and a long era of peace . We have a vision of a new partnership of nations that transcends the Cold War a partnership based on consultation , cooperation , and collective action , especially through international and regional organizations a partnership united by principle and the rule of law and supported by an equitable sharing of both cost and commitment a partnership whose goals are to increase democracy , increase prosperity , increase the peace , and reduce arms . And as we look to the future , the calendar offers up a convenient milestone , a signpost , by which to measure our progress as a community of nations . The year 2000 marks a turning point , beginning not only the turn of the decade , not only the turn of the century , but also the turn of the millennium . And 10 years from now , as the 55th session of the General Assembly begins , you will again find many of us in this hall , hair a bit more gray perhaps , maybe a little less spring in our walk but you will not find us with any less hope or idealism or any less confidence in the ultimate triumph of mankind . I see a world of open borders , open trade and , most importantly , open minds a world that celebrates the common heritage that belongs to all the world s people , taking pride not just in hometown or homeland but in humanity itself . I see a world touched by a spirit like that of the Olympics , based not on competition that is driven by fear but sought out of joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence . And I see a world where democracy continues to win new friends and convert old foes and where the Americas North , Central , and South can provide a model for the future of all humankind the world s first completely democratic hemisphere . And I see a world building on the emerging new model of European unity , not just Europe but the whole world whole and free . This is precisely why the present aggression in the Gulf is a menace not only to one region s security but to the entire world s vision of our future . It threatens to turn the dream of a new international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy in which the law of the jungle supplants the law of nations . And that is why the United Nations reacted with such historic unity and resolve . And that is why this challenge is a test that we cannot afford to fail . I am confident we will prevail . Success , too , will have lasting consequences reinforcing civilized standards of international conduct , setting a new precedent in international cooperation , brightening the prospects for our vision of the future . There are 10 more years until this century is out , 10 more years to put the struggles of the 20th century permanently behind us , 10 more years to help launch a new partnership of nations . And throughout those 10 years , and beginning now , the United Nations has a new and vital role in building towards that partnership . Last year s General Assembly showed how we can make greater progress toward a more pragmatic and successful United Nations . And for the first time , the Security Council is beginning to work as it was designed to work . And now is the time to set aside old and counterproductive debates and procedures and controversies and resolutions . It is time to replace polemic attacks with pragmatic action . And we have shown that the can count on the collective strength of the international community . We have shown that the can rise to the challenge of aggression just as its founders hoped that it would . And now is the time of testing . And we must also show that the United Nations is the place to build international support and consensus for meeting the other challenges we face . The world remains a dangerous place and our security and well being often depends , in part , on events occurring far away . We need serious international cooperative efforts to make headway on the threats to the environment , on terrorism , on managing the debt burden , on fighting the scourge of international drug trafficking , and on refugees , and peacekeeping efforts around the world . But the world also remains a hopeful place . Calls for democracy and human rights are being reborn everywhere , and these calls are an expression of support for the values enshrined in the United Nations Charter . They encourage our hopes for a more stable , more peaceful , more prosperous world . Free elections are the foundation of democratic government and can produce dramatic successes , as we have seen in Namibia and Nicaragua . And the time has come to structure the role in such efforts more formally . And so , today I propose that the establish a Special Coordinator for Electoral Assistance , to be assisted by a Electoral Commission comprised of distinguished experts from around the world . As with free elections , we also believe that universal membership for all states is central to the future of this organization and to this new partnership we have discussed . In support of this principle and in conjunction with efforts to reduce regional tensions , the United States fully supports membership for the Republic of Korea . We do so without prejudice to the ultimate objective of reunification of the Korean Peninsula and without opposition to simultaneous membership for the Democratic People s Republic of Korea . Building on these and other initiatives , we must join together in a new compact all of us to bring the United Nations into the 21st century , and I call today for a major long term effort to do so . We should build on the success the admirable success of our distinguished Secretary General , my longtime friend and yours , my longtime colleague I might also say , Javier Perez de Cuellar . We should strive for greater effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations . The United States is committed to playing its part , helping to maintain global security , promoting democracy and prosperity . And my administration is fully committed to supporting the United Nations and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to the Charter . International peace and security , and international freedom and prosperity , require no less . The world must know and understand From this hour , from this day , from this hall , we step forth with a new sense of purpose , a new sense of possibilities . We stand together , prepared to swim upstream , to march uphill , to tackle the tough challenges as they come not only as the United Nations but as the nations of the world united . And so , let it be said of the final decade of the 20th century This was a time when humankind came into its own , when we emerged from the grit and the smoke of the industrial age to bring about a revolution of the spirit and the mind and began a journey into a new day , a new age , and a new partnership of nations . The is now fulfilling its promise as the world s parliament of peace . And I congratulate you . I support you . And I wish you Godspeed in the challenges ahead . Thank you very , very much .<speech_sep>Thank you all very much . Good luck . Please be seated . Thank you , General Graves , for that very kind introduction . Barbara and I are just delighted to be here and honored that we could be joined by our able Secretary of the Army , Mike Stone of course , the man well known here that heads our Army , General Sullivan , General Gordon Sullivan and Gracie Graves , General Robert Foley , General Galloway Shawn Daniel , well known to everybody here , been our host , in a sense and a West Point alum who has been at my side for 4 years , over here somewhere , General Scowcroft , graduate of this great institution who served his country with such distinction . May I salute the members of the Board of Visitors . I see another I have to single out , General Galvin , who served his country with such honor . And , of course , save the best for last , the Corps of Cadets , thank you for that welcome . Let me begin with the hard part It is difficult for a Navy person to come up to West Point after that game a month ago . Go ahead , rub it in . But I watched it . Amazing things can happen in sports . Look at the Oilers , my other team that took it on the chin the other day . But I guess the moral of all of this is that losing is never easy . Trust me , I know something about that . But if you have to lose , that is the way to do it Fight with all you have . Give it your best shot . And win or lose , learn from it , and get on with life . I am about to get on with the rest of my life . But before I do , I want to share with you at this institution of leadership some of my thinking , both about the world you will soon be called upon to enter and the life that you have chosen . Any President has several functions . He speaks for and to the Nation . He must faithfully execute the law . And he must lead . But no function , none of the President s hats , in my view , is more important than his role as Commander in Chief . For it is as Commander in Chief that the President confronts and makes decisions that one way or another affects the lives of everyone in this country as well as many others around the world . I have had many occasions to don this most important of hats . Over the past 4 years , the men and women who proudly and bravely wear the uniforms of the armed services have been called upon to go in harm s way and have discharged their duty with honor and professionalism . I wish I could say that such demands were a thing of the past , that with the end of the cold war the calls upon the United States would diminish . I cannot . Yes , the end of the cold war , we would all concede , is a blessing . It is a time of great promise . Democratic governments have never been so numerous . What happened 2 or 3 days ago in Moscow would not have been possible in the cold war days . Thanks to historic treaties such as that START II pact just reached with Russia , the likelihood of nuclear holocaust is vastly diminished . But this does not mean that there is no specter of war , no threats to be reckoned with . And already , we see disturbing signs of what this new world could become if we are passive and aloof . We would risk the emergence of a world characterized by violence , characterized by chaos , one in which dictators and tyrants threaten their neighbors , build arsenals brimming with weapons of mass destruction , and ignore the welfare of their own men , women , and children . And we could see a horrible increase in international terrorism , with American citizens more at risk than ever before . We cannot and we need not allow this to happen . Our objective must be to exploit the unparalleled opportunity presented by the cold war s end to work toward transforming this new world into a new world order , one of governments that are democratic , tolerant , and economically free at home and committed abroad to settling inevitable differences peacefully , without the threat or use of force . Unfortunately , not everyone subscribes to these principles . We continue to see leaders bent on denying fundamental human rights and seizing territory regardless of the human cost . No , an international society , one more attuned to the enduring principles that have made this country a beacon of hope for so many for so long , will not just emerge on its own . It is got to be built . Two hundred years ago , another departing President warned of the dangers of what he described as entangling alliances . His was the right course for a new nation at that point in history . But what was entangling in Washington s day is now essential . This is why , at Texas A and M a few weeks ago , I spoke of the folly of isolationism and of the importance , morally , economically , and strategically , of the United States remaining involved in world affairs . We must engage ourselves if a new world order , one more compatible with our values and congenial to our interest , is to emerge . But even more , we must lead . Leadership , well , it takes many forms . It can be political or diplomatic . It can be economic or military . It can be moral or spiritual leadership . Leadership can take any one of these forms , or it can be a combination of them . Leadership should not be confused with either unilateralism or universalism . We need not respond by ourselves to each and every outrage of violence . The fact that America can act does not mean that it must . A nation s sense of idealism need not be at odds with its interests , nor does principle displace prudence . No , the United States should not seek to be the world s policeman . There is no support abroad or at home for us to play this role , nor should there be . We would exhaust ourselves in the process , wasting precious resources needed to address those problems at home and abroad that we cannot afford to ignore . But in the wake of the cold war , in a world where we are the only remaining superpower , it is the role of the United States to marshal its moral and material resources to promote a democratic peace . It is our responsibility , it is our opportunity to lead . There is no one else . Leadership cannot be simply asserted or demanded . It must be demonstrated . Leadership requires formulating worthy goals , persuading others of their virtue , and contributing one s share of the common effort and then some . Leadership takes time . It takes patience . It takes work . Some of this work must take place here at home . Congress does have a constitutional role to play . Leadership therefore also involves working with the Congress and the American people to provide the essential domestic underpinning if military commitments are to be sustainable . This is what our administration , the Bush administration , has tried to do . When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , it was the United States that galvanized the Security Council to act and then mobilized the successful coalition on the battlefield . The pattern not exactly the same but similar in Somalia First the United States underscored the importance of alleviating the growing tragedy , and then we organized humanitarian efforts designed to bring hope , food , and peace . At times , real leadership requires a willingness to use military force . And force can be a useful backdrop to diplomacy , a complement to it , or , if need be , a temporary alternative . As Commander in Chief , I have made the difficult choice to use military force . I determined we could not allow Saddam s forces to ravage Kuwait and hold this critical region at gunpoint . I thought then , and I think now , that using military force to implement the resolutions of the Security Council was in the interest of the United States and the world community . The need to use force arose as well in the wake of the Gulf war , when we came to the aid of the peoples of both northern and southern Iraq . And more recently , as I am sure you know , I determined that only the use of force could stem this human tragedy of Somalia . The United States should not stand by with so many lives at stake and when a limited deployment of forces , buttressed by the forces of other countries and acting under the full authority of the United Nations , could make an immediate and dramatic difference , and do so without excessive levels of risk and cost . Operations Provide Comfort and Southern Watch in Iraq and then Operation Restore Hope in Somalia all bear witness to the wisdom of selected use of force for selective purposes . Sometimes the decision not to use force , to stay our hand , I can tell you , it is just as difficult as the decision to send our soldiers into battle . The former Yugoslavia , well , it is been such a situation . There are , we all know , important humanitarian and strategic interests at stake there . But up to now it is not been clear that the application of limited amounts of force by the United States and its traditional friends and allies would have had the desired effect , given the nature and complexity of that situation . Our assessment of the situation in the former Yugoslavia could well change if and as the situation changes . The stakes could grow the conflict could threaten to spread . Indeed , we are constantly reassessing our options and are actively consulting with others about steps that might be taken to contain the fighting , protect the humanitarian effort , and deny Serbia the fruits of aggression . Military force is never a tool to be used lightly or universally . In some circumstances it may be essential , in others counterproductive . I know that many people would like to find some formula , some easy formula to apply , to tell us with precision when and where to intervene with force . Anyone looking for scientific certitude is in for a disappointment . In the complex new world we are entering , there can be no single or simple set of fixed rules for using force . Inevitably , the question of military intervention requires judgment . Each and every case is unique . To adopt rigid criteria would guarantee mistakes involving American interests and American lives . And it would give would be troublemakers a blueprint for determining their own actions . It could signal friends and allies that our support was not to be counted on . Similarly , we cannot always decide in advance which interests will require our using military force to protect them . The relative importance of an interest is not a guide Military force may not be the best way of safeguarding something vital , while using force might be the best way to protect an interest that qualifies as important but less than vital . But to warn against a futile quest for a set of hard and fast rules to govern the use of military force is not to say there cannot be some principles to inform our decisions . Such guidelines can prove useful in sizing and , indeed , shaping our forces and in helping us to think our way through this key question . Using military force makes sense as a policy where the stakes warrant , where and when force can be effective , where no other policies are likely to prove effective , where its application can be limited in scope and time , and where the potential benefits justify the potential costs and sacrifice . Once we are satisfied that force makes sense , we must act with the maximum possible support . The United States can and should lead , but we will want to act in concert , where possible involving the United Nations or other multinational grouping . The United States can and should contribute to the common undertaking in a manner commensurate with our wealth , with our strength . But others should also contribute militarily , be it by providing combat or support forces , access to facilities or bases , or overflight rights . And similarly , others should contribute economically . It is unreasonable to expect the United States to bear the full financial burden of intervention when other nations have a stake in the outcome . A desire for international support must not become a prerequisite for acting , though . Sometimes a great power has to act alone . I made a tough decision I might say , on advice of our outstanding military leaders who are so well known to everybody here to use military force in Panama when American lives and the security of the Canal appeared to be threatened by outlaws who stole power in the face of free elections . And similarly , we moved swiftly to safeguard democracy in the Philippines . But in every case involving the use of force , it will be essential to have a clear and achievable mission , a realistic plan for accomplishing the mission , and criteria no less realistic for withdrawing forces once the mission is complete . Only if we keep these principles in mind will the potential sacrifice be one that can be explained and justified . We must never forget that using force is not some political abstraction but a real commitment of our fathers and mothers and sons and daughters , brothers and sisters , friends and neighbors . You have got to look at it in human terms . In order even to have the choice , we must have available adequate military forces tailored for a wide range of contingencies , including peacekeeping . Indeed , leading the effort toward a new world order will require a modern , capable military , in some areas necessitating more rather than less defense spending . As President , I have said that my ability to deploy force on behalf of interests abroad was made possible because past Presidents , and I would single out in particular my predecessor , Ronald Reagan , and past Secretaries of Defense sustained a strong military . Consistent with this sacred trust , I am proud to pass on to my successor , President elect Clinton , a military second to none . We have the very best . Yet , it is essential to recognize that as important as such factors are , any military is more than simply the sum of its weapons or the state of its technology . What makes any armed force truly effective is the quality of its leadership , the quality of its training , the quality of its people . We have succeeded abroad in no small part because of our people in uniform . The men and women in our Armed Forces have demonstrated their ability to master the challenges of modern warfare . And at the same time , and whether on the battlefield of Iraq or in some tiny little village in Somalia , America s soldiers have always brought a quality of caring and kindness to their mission . Who will ever forget I know I will not those terrified Iraqi soldiers surrendering to American troops And who will forget the way the American soldier held out his arms and said , It is okay . You are all right now . Or in Somalia , the young marine , eyes filled with tears , holding the fragile arm of an emaciated child . There can be no doubt about it The All Volunteer Force is one of the true success stories of modern day America . It is instructive to look at just why this is so . At its heart , a voluntary military is based upon choice you all know that the decision freely taken by young men and women to join , the decision by more mature men and women to remain . And the institution of the Armed Forces has thrived on its commitment to developing and promoting excellence . It is meritocracy in action . Race , religion , wealth , background count not . Indeed , the military offers many examples for the rest of society , showing what can be done to eradicate the scourge of drugs , to break down the barriers of racial discrimination , to offer equal opportunity to women . This is not just a result of self selection . It also reflects the military s commitment to education and training . You know , people speak of defense conversion , the process by which the defense firms retool for civilian tasks . Well , defense conversion within the military has been going on for years . It is the constant process of training and retraining , which the military does so well , that allows individuals to keep up with the latest technology , take on more challenging assignments , and prepare for life on the outside . Out of this culture of merit and competition have emerged hundreds of thousands of highly skilled men and women brimming with real self confidence . What they possess is a special mix of discipline , a willingness to accept direction , and the confidence , a willingness to accept responsibility . Together , discipline and confidence provide the basis for winning , for getting the job done . There is no higher calling , no more honorable choice than the one that you here today have made . To join the Armed Forces is to be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for your country and for your fellow man . What you have done , what you are doing , sends an important message , one that I fear sometimes gets lost amidst today s often materialist , self interested culture . It is important to remember , it is important to demonstrate that there is a higher purpose to life beyond one s self . Now , I speak of family , of community , of ideals . I speak of duty , honor , country . There are many forms of contributing to this country , of public service . Yes , there is government . There is voluntarism . I love to talk about the thousand Points of Light , one American helping another . The daily tasks that require doing in our classrooms , in our hospitals , our cities , our farms , all can and do represent a form of service . In whatever form , service benefits our society , and it ennobles the giver . It is a cherished American concept , one we should continue to practice and pass on to our children . This was what I wanted to share on this occasion . You are beginning your service to country , and I am nearing the end of mine . Exactly half a century ago , in June of 1942 , as General Graves mentioned , we were at war , and I was graduating from school . The speaker that day at Andover was the then Secretary of War , Henry Stimson . And his message was one of public service , but with a twist on the importance of finishing one s schooling before going off to fight for one s country . I listened closely to what he had to say , but I did not take his advice . And that day was my 18th birthday . And when the commencement ceremony ended , I went on into Boston and enlisted in the Navy as a seaman 2d class . And I never regretted it . You , too , have signed up . You , too , will never regret it . And I salute you for it . Fortunately , because of the sacrifices made in years before and still being made , you should be able to complete this phase of your education . A half century has passed since I left school to go into the service . A half century has passed since that day when Stimson spoke of the challenge of creating a new world . You will also be entering a new world , one far better than the one I came to know , a world with the potential to be far better yet . This is the challenge . This is the opportunity of your lifetimes . I envy you for it , and I wish you Godspeed . And while I am at it , as your Commander in Chief , I hereby grant amnesty to the Corps of Cadets . Thank you all very much . Thank you . Thank you very , very much . Good luck to all of you . Warm up here . Good luck to you guys . Thank you .<speech_sep>I think we have seen a deterioration of values . I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned . For a while , as I recall , it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs , and I think that is all wrong . So we have seen a deterioration in values , and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools . We got away , we got into this feeling that value free education was the thing . And I do not believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use . And , of course , as far as the how we make it better , yes , we can do better on interdiction . But we have got to do a lot better on education , and we have to do , be tougher on those who commit crimes . We have got to get after the users more . We have to change this whole culture . You know , I saw a movie , Crocodile Dundee . And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor , as though this was a humorous little incident . And it is bad . Everybody ought to be in this thing . Entertainment industry , people involved in the schools , education . And it is not a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem . But we have got to instill values in these young people . And I have put forward a many point drug program that includes what I would do as President of the United States in terms of doing better on interdiction and in terms of better in the neighborhoods . But I think we are all in this together , and my plea to the American people is values in the schools . Well , the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CII asked for and received the same briefing . I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information . And what I am about to say is unclassified . Seven administrations were dealing with Noriega . It was the Reagan Bush administration that brought this man to justice . And as the governor of Massachusetts knows , there was no evidence that governor that Noriega was involved in drugs , no hard evidence until we indicted him . And so I think it is about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective . Panama is a friendly country . I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering , and Noriega was there , but there was no evidence at that time , and when the evidence was there , we indicted him . And we want to bring him to justice . And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations . Is this the time to unleash our one liners That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor . Let me help the Governor . There are so many things there , I do not quite know where to begin . When you cut capital gains , you put people to work . John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains . Paul Tsongas , a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut . It is not going to cost the government money . It is going to increase revenues to the federal government , and it is going to create jobs . So that is one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us . Massachusetts does not have an enormous defense budget , but nevertheless , the governor raised taxes five different times . That happens to be a fact . And so let us kind of stay on the issue , and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze . And it permits economists on the East Coast and West think it is good it permits the president to sort out the priorities , and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes . I think it is the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down . And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down , but we have got to get the Democrats Congress under control . They do all the spending , they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime . I had like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the President what 43 governors have , the line item veto . He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso . I would like a balanced budget amendment . But the dynamics of the economy we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years . So the problem is it is not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out the woman working in some factory being taxed too little . It is that we are continuing to spend too much . So , my formula says grow at the rate of inflation . Permit the President to set the priorities on where we do the spending . And remember the federal deficit has come down 70 billion in one year , in 1987 . And if we and the actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending . Spending was only up something like 4 percent . So , it is not that we are taking too little from taxpayer we are spending too much still . And the formula I have given you works , we have put it through a good economic model , we have got good economists on the West Coast , Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who is a very respected economist in the Massachusetts . And they agree , that if we can do what I have said , we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again . Capital gains , one more point on that , please let us learn from history . A capital gains differential will increase jobs , increase risk taking , increase revenues to the federal government . One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and , thus , throw some people out of work . I want to keep this economic recovery going . More Americans at work today than any time in history , a greater percentage of the work force . What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid . I believe that is the answer . I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill . And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we are talking about here . But we have got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work . So , the answer lies , it seems to me , in full enforcement of the catastrophic program . It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this , because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say , We cannot make it . And I think then you are going to see that people are put out of work . All these programs and this cost on his is was I saw an estimate , I had love to know what he thinks , 35 40 billion and it seems to me that somebody pays that . There is not any such thing as something free out there . It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete . So , I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system . I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance . I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience . It is a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance . But I just do not want to mandate it and risk putting this setting the recovery back . You do not like the answer , but it is an answer . Well , we are on the right track . The NIH is doing a good job in research . The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education . I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing . But we got to have a knowledge base . Testing should be confidential , but we have to have a knowledge . We cannot simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing . I am chairman of the President s Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help . And you got to be careful here , because there is a safety factor , but I think these things and then also I am one who believes we have got to go the extra mile in clean being sure that that blood supply is pure . We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature . So , research , speeding the drugs to market , testing , blood supply are very important elements of this . Well , I do not question his passion . I question and I do not question his concern about the war in Vietnam . He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war . Now , that is a certain passion that in my view it is misguided passion . He we have a big difference on issues . You see , last year in the primary , he expressed his passion . He said , I am a strong liberal Democrat August , 87 . Then he said , I am a card carrying member of the ACLU . That was what he said . He is out there on out of the mainstream . He is very passionate . My argument with the governor is , do we want this country to go that far left . And I wish we had time to let me explain . But I salute him for his passion . We just have a big difference on where this country should be led , and in what direction it ought to go . Nothing s wrong with it . But just take a look at the positions of the ACLBut , Peter , please understand , the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They do not like it when I say that he says he is a card carrying member . Now , if that quote was wrong , he can repudiate it , right here . I have seen it authoritatively written twice , and if I have done him an injustice , and he did not say it , I am very , very sorry . But I do not agree with a lot of most of the positions of the ACLI simply do not want to see the ratings on movies . I do not want my 10 year old grandchild to go into an X rated movie . I like those ratings systems . I do not think they are right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church . I do not want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed I do not want to see under God come out from our currency . Now , these are all positions of the ACLAnd I do not agree with them . He has every right to exercise his passion , as what he said , a strong , progressive liberal . I do not agree with that . I come from a different point . And I think I am more in touch with the mainstream of America . They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance . You see , I had have found a way to sign that bill . Governor Thompson of Illinois did . I am not questioning his patriotism . He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism . And then all the liberal columnists join in . I am not . I am questioning his judgment on these matters , or where he is coming from He has every right to do it . But I believe that is not what the American people want , and when he said , when he said at the convention , ideology does not matter , just competence , he was moving away from his own record , from what his passion has been over the years . And that is all I am trying to do , is put it in focus . And I hope people do not think that I am questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization . I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded . I believe that that would help in terms of shelter . I want to see when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light , I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help . The Governor s wife has been very active in the homeless . My campaign chairman , Secretary Jim Baker s wife . This is not government . These are people that care , that are trying to give of themselves . The government has a role . It is to fully fund the McKinney Act . There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it is rough . And so I think that we are on the right track . I do not see this , incidentally , as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea . I see an involvement by a thousand points of light . I see the funding that is required , and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill . They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work . And we are on the track on this one . But and look , mental that was a little overstated it . I had say around 30 percent . And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out . Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them . Because there is a major problem there . A lot of them are mentally sick . And we have got to attend to them . But fully , my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act . I think the Governor is blurring housing and the homeless . Let us talk about housing , which the question was . When you talk to those bankers , did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House Ten days before I took the oath of office as President they were 21 1 2 percent . Now , how does that grab you for increasing housing Housing is up . We are serving a million more families now . But we are not going to do it in that old Democratic , liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars . Go out and take a look at Louis at some of that effort . It is wrong . I favor home ownership . I want to see more vouchers . I want to see control of some of these projects , and I want to keep the interest rates down . They are half , now of what they were when we came into office , and with my policy of getting this deficit under control , they will be a lot less . But if we spend and spend and spend , that is going to wrap up the housing market , and we will go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome thank God for the United States on that one . Well , the Massachusetts furlough program was unique . It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole . The federal program does not do that . No other state programs do that . And I favor the death penalty . I know it is tough and honest people can disagree . But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer , I think they ought to pay with their life . And I do believe it would be inhibiting . And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton , and I would meet with their , the victims of his last escapade , the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland . Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton , the man who was furloughed , the murderer , because they did not want him to be furloughed again . And so we have a fundamental difference on this one . And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life . I favor adoption . I do not favor abortion . I have not sorted out the penalties . But I do know , I do know that I oppose abortion . And I favor adoption . And if we can get this law changed , everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted , take the let them come to birth , and then put them in a family where they will be loved . And you see , yes , my position has evolved . And it is continuing to evolve , and it is evolving in favor of life . And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support rape , incest and the life of the mother . Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this , but it is much clearer for me now . As I have seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device , for heavens sakes . See the millions of these killings accumulate , and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion . We certainly do . But no , I am for the sanctity of life , and once that illegality is established , then we can come to grips with the penalty side , and of course there is got to be some penalties to enforce the law , whatever they may be . I just One of the reasons , and I first would like to know which programs you are talking about , and then we could talk on the merits of the programs . But , you see , my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible . That might be the explanation , if you tell me the program . I do strongly support the WIC program . I think it is good . I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid , to challenge the states , and maybe we are going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these . But , Peter , so much of it is , gets into a whole other phase of things . The neighborhood , the kind of environment people are growing up in , and that leads me to the programs I am talking about in terms of education . I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods , and that is why I am a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood , why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat , the Boston Police Department the other day . I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods . And so it is a combination of these things . But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light . The people that are out there trying to help these kids , the programs like cities and schools , the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty . I am for Head Start and moving that up . And I have already made a proposal and yes , it will cost some money . But I favor that . So these are the combination of things I want , and the fact that I do not think the federal government can endorse a 35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program . What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems , the man has just said he does not understand what I am talking about . This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals . They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all . The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government it is up . It is not down . But here s the point he misses . The federal government spends 7 percent of the total on education , and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I am talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature are putting up 93 percent . But the federal spending for education is up , and I want to be the education President , because I want to see us do better . We are putting more money per child into education , and we are not performing as we should . We have gotten away fro values and the fundamentals . And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence . And we can do it . But it sup1 s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington , C . Well , I thought the question was about defense . The Governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West . And because we did not listen to the freeze advocates , and strengthen the defense of this country , we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age . Now , we are sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms , and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the Mthe modernization or our nuclear capability . That is not the way you deal with the Soviets . I have met Gorbachev . Met Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day . These people are tough . But now we have a chance . I few have experience and now how to handle it , but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be , when the morale was down , and when we were the laughing stock around the world . And now we are back , because we have strengthened the defenses of this country , and believe me , I do not want to see us return to those days . As to Ferdinand Marcos , he is not there any more . It was under our administration that Aquino came in . But I will tell you what I was thinking of . I flew a combat mission , my last one was over Manila . And he was down there fighting against imperialism . And he had just And he just lifted martial law . And he just called for new elections . And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy . And out he goes . I do not think it is a question of eliminating . I can tell him some I am against . A 6for example . DIVAAnd I can go on and on . Minuteman IIpenetration systems . I mean , there is plenty of them that I oppose , but what I am not going to do , when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union , sitting down talking to Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons , I am not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game . I am simply not going to do that . And under me , when I lead this country , the Secretary of Defense is going to have to make the choices , between how we keep , how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile , or on the Minuteman , whatever it is . We are going to have to the MWe are going to have to do that . It is Christmas . Would not it be nice to be perfect Would not it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake These are the my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts , and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works , and so this is where I have a big difference . Of course we are going to have to make some determination on this , and we are going to have to make it on the convention forces . But now we have got a very good concept called competitive strategies . We will do what we do best . It is a strategy that we have been working on for a couple of years . It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces . But look , let me sum it up . I want to be the President that gets conventional forces balance . I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth . But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start . And I think I have had that . What I think we ought to do is take a look at Perestroika and Glasnost , welcome them , but keep our eyes open . Be cautious . Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet . Yes , I think it is fine to do business with them . And , so , I am encouraged with what I see when I talk to what I hear when I talk to Gorbachev and Shevardnadze , but can they pull it off . And when they have a they a deals that are good for us , as China started to do the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing , in terms of incentive , in partnership and things of this nature . And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path . We should encourage that . We ought to say this is good . But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority . I am not going to do that , because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment . And the interesting place one of the things that fascinates me about this Perestroika and Glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe . You see the turmoil in Poland today . And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade . I do not want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets . We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did . But this is an exciting time . But all I am suggesting is let us not be na iuml ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid . Look at the INF treaty . And if we have not learned from the negotiating history on that , we will never learn . The freeze people were wrong . The Reagan Bush administration was right . I am not reconsidering my position . Two questions How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud . Those are two hypo rhetorical questions . He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups . The armed forces , the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready . Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high . And secondly , in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard , the Democratic controlled Congress , so please help us with that , who cut 70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics . He is got to get this thing more clear . Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud I will fully research it , go forward as fast as we can . We have set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable , I will deploy it . That is my position on SDI and it is never wavered a bit . I wrote the anti terrorist report for this government . It is the best anti terrorist report written . Yes , we should not trade arms for hostages . But we have made vast improvements in our anti terrorism . Now , it is fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps , but when the President saw this state sponsored fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life , he hit Libya . And my opponent was unwilling to support that action . And since that action , terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down . And I have long ago said I supported the President on this other matter . And I have said mistakes were made . Clearly nobody s going to think the President started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages . That is a very serious charge against the President . The matter has been thoroughly looked into . But the point is sometimes the action has to be taken by the federal government and when we took action , it had a favorable response . You are judged by the whole record . You are judged by the entire record . Are we closer to peace Are we doing better in anti terrorism Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past , are we doing better there How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf . Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace You judge on the record . Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and about Angola now , we have a chance several Bostonians do not like it , but the rest of the country will understand . Now we have a chance . Now we have a chance . And , so , I think that I had leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record . And let me say this all he can talk about he goes around ranting about Noriega . Now , I have told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that . He can talk about Iran Contra and also I will make a deal with you , I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration . I still have a couple of minutes left . And there is a difference principle It is only on yellow here . Wait a minute . Jim I said I was not perfect . Where was I I finished . I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice , to the House of Representatives twice . I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30s and 40s . I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we are in , so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit for a work that will be productive and he will not have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal talking about . I see a young man who is a knowledgeable in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable in the whole in the race knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them . And I believe that he will be outstanding . And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding . And I had like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal . And he is kept his head up . And he will do very very well . And he has my full confidence and he will have the confidence of people that are in their 30s and 40s and more . So , judge the man on his record not on the lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name . My opponent says Danforth Quayle . Do you know who Danforth was , he was a man who gave his life in World War Iso ridiculing a person s name is a little beneath this process . And he will do very well when we get into the debates . Just the facts . No , I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd . Well , I we obviously have a difference . I believe it does meet the test . We will have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum , wonderful friendly fashion like this . I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening . I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him . But now we have got the lines too carefully drawn here . But you talk about judgment . I mean , what kind of judgment I mean , jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy . What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts I mean , there is I do not think this is a fair argument . But nevertheless , I support my nominee for Vice President and he will do an outstanding job . I oppose supply management and production controls . I support the farm bill , the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction . I want to expand our markets abroad and that is why I have called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture . I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country . I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product , so I am optimistic about the agricultural economy . In terms of the Third World , I support the Baker plan . I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do , we are succeeding . And I do not want to see the banks let off the hook . I would oppose that , but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged . But let us not go back to that what they call supply management and production control , that ll simply price us out of the international market . Let us try to expand our markets abroad . I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country . But there are two main focal points of this election . Opportunity and peace . I want to keep this expansion going . Yes , we want change but we are the change . I am the change . I do not want to go back to malaise and misery index . And , so , opportunity . Keep America at work . The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector . And in terms of peace , we are on the right track . We have achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it . I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons . I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces . And then it gets down to a question of values . We have had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing . And I do favor the death penalty . And we have got a wide array of differences on those . But in the final analysis in the final analysis , the person goes into that voting booth , they are going to say , Who has the values I believe in Who has the experience that we trust Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done My fellow Americans , I am that man and I ask for your support . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Thank you , Governor . Thank you all very much for that welcome . Good luck , good luck to you . Thank you , ladies and gentlemen , thank you all . Chairman McKenzie and Adkisson and Mobley , thank you for having me here . And to the Singing Cadets , thank you for that very special treat . And to my Secretary of Commerce , Bob Mosbacher , I am delighted that he is with me today . I want to pay my special respects to our Governor , Bill Clements to your Congressman from this district , Joe Barton and then , of course , to Senator Phil Gramm . He said he taught economics here and in Congress . It is hard to be humble . But nevertheless the point is the guy s telling the truth , and we are grateful to him every day for his leadership up there in Washington , as we are for Joe Barton as well . So , we have got a good combination Phil Gramm in the Senate and today Joe Barton in the United States Congress a wonderful combination , with these Aggie values in the forefront . I was brought here today by an Aggie , and I brought him here to this marvelous ceremony with me . He was mentioned by Congressman Barton , but I would like to ask the pilot of Air Force One , Lieutenant Colonel Dan Barr , to stand up so you can see another Aggie all suited up , up there . And you met my day to day inside Aggie , Fred McClure . We work every minute of the day on matters affecting the legislative interests of this country , but I will not reintroduce Fred . But I am delighted to be back among my fellow Texans and friends . And for those of you who are Democrats , there is no truth to the rumor that Phil Gramm and I are ready to take our elephant walk . My sincerest congratulations go to every graduate and to your parents . In this ceremony , we celebrate nothing less than the commencement of the rest , and the best , of your life . And when you look back at your days at Texas A and you will have a lot to be proud of a university that is first in baseball and first in service to our nation . Many are the heroes whose names are called at muster . Many are those you remember in Silver Taps . We are reminded that no generation can escape history . Parents , we share a fervent desire for our children and their children to know a better world , a safer world . And students , your parents and grandparents have lived through a world war and helped America to rebuild the world . They witnessed the drama of postwar nations divided by Soviet subversion and force , but sustained by an allied response most vividly seen in the Berlin airlift . And today I would like to use this joyous and solemn occasion to speak to you and to the rest of the country about our relations with the Soviet Union . It is fitting that these remarks be made here at Texas A and M University . Wise men Truman and Eisenhower , Vandenberg and Rayburn , Marshall , Acheson , and Kennan crafted the strategy of containment . They believed that the Soviet Union , denied the easy course of expansion , would turn inward and address the contradictions of its inefficient , repressive , and inhumane system . And they were right the Soviet Union is now publicly facing this hard reality . Containment worked . Containment worked because our democratic principles and institutions and values are sound and always have been . It worked because our alliances were , and are , strong and because the superiority of free societies and free markets over stagnant socialism is undeniable . We are approaching the conclusion of an historic postwar struggle between two visions one of tyranny and conflict and one of democracy and freedom . The review of S . Soviet relations that my administration has just completed outlines a new path toward resolving this struggle . Our goal is bold , more ambitious than any of my predecessors could have thought possible . Our review indicates that 40 years of perseverance have brought us a precious opportunity , and now it is time to move beyond containment to a new policy for the 1990s one that recognizes the full scope of change taking place around the world and in the Soviet Union itself . In sum , the United States now has as its goal much more than simply containing Soviet expansionism . We seek the integration of the Soviet Union into the community of nations . And as the Soviet Union itself moves toward greater openness and democratization , as they meet the challenge of responsible international behavior , we will match their steps with steps of our own . Ultimately , our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back into the world order . The Soviet Union says that it seeks to make peace with the world and criticizes its own postwar policies . These are words that we can only applaud , but a new relationship cannot simply be declared by Moscow or bestowed by others it must be earned . It must be earned because promises are never enough . The Soviet Union has promised a more cooperative relationship before , only to reverse course and return to militarism . Soviet foreign policy has been almost seasonal warmth before cold , thaw before freeze . We seek a friendship that knows no season of suspicion , no chill of distrust . We hope perestroika is pointing the Soviet Union to a break with the cycles of the past a definitive break . Who would have thought that we would see the deliberations of the Central Committee on the front page of Pravda or dissident Andrei Sakharov seated near the councils of power Who would have imagined a Soviet leader who canvasses the sidewalks of Moscow and also Washington , C . These are hopeful , indeed , remarkable signs . And let no one doubt our sincere desire to see perestroika , this reform , continue and succeed . But the national security of America and our allies is not predicated on hope . It must be based on deeds , and we look for enduring , ingrained economic and political change . While we hope to move beyond containment , we are only at the beginning of our new path . Many dangers and uncertainties are ahead . We must not forget that the Soviet Union has acquired awesome military capabilities . That was a fact of life for my predecessors , and that is always been a fact of life for our allies . And that is a fact of life for me today as President of the United States . As we seek peace , we must also remain strong . The purpose of our military might is not to pressure a weak Soviet economy or to seek military superiority . It is to deter war . It is to defend ourselves and our allies and to do something more to convince the Soviet Union that there can be no reward in pursuing expansionism , to convince the Soviet Union that reward lies in the pursuit of peace . Western policies must encourage the evolution of the Soviet Union toward an open society . This task will test our strength . It will tax our patience , and it will require a sweeping vision . Let me share with you my vision I see a Western Hemisphere of democratic , prosperous nations , no longer threatened by a Cuba or a Nicaragua armed by Moscow . I see a Soviet Union as it pulls away from ties to terrorist nations like Libya that threaten the legitimate security of their neighbors . I see a Soviet Union which respects China s integrity and returns the northern territories to Japan , a prelude to the day when all the great nations of Asia will live in harmony . But the fulfillment of this vision requires the Soviet Union to take positive steps , including First , reduce Soviet forces . Although some small steps have already been taken , the Warsaw Pact still possesses more than 30 , 000 tanks , more than twice as much artillery , and hundreds of thousands more troops in Europe than NATThey should cut their forces to less threatening levels , in proportion to their legitimate security needs . Second , adhere to the Soviet obligation , promised in the final days of World War Ito support self determination for all the nations of Eastern Europe and central Europe . And this requires specific abandonment of the Brezhnev doctrine . One day it should be possible to drive from Moscow to Munich without seeing a single guard tower or a strand of barbed wire . In short , tear down the Iron Curtain . And third , work with the West in positive , practical not merely rhetorical steps toward diplomatic solution to these regional disputes around the world . I welcome the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan , and the Angola agreement . But there is much more to be done around the world . We are ready . Let us roll up our sleeves and get to work . And fourth , achieve a lasting political pluralism and respect for human rights . Dramatic events have already occurred in Moscow . We are impressed by limited , but freely contested elections . We are impressed by a greater toleration of dissent . We are impressed by a new frankness about the Stalin era . Gorbachev , do not stop now And fifth , join with us in addressing pressing global problems , including the international drug menace and dangers to the environment . We can build a better world for our children . As the Soviet Union moves toward arms reduction and reform , it will find willing partners in the West . We seek verifiable , stabilizing arms control and arms reduction agreements with the Soviet Union and its allies . However , arms control is not an end in itself but a means of contributing to the security of America and the peace of the world . I directed Secretary Baker to propose to the Soviets that we resume negotiations on strategic forces in June and , as you know , the Soviet Union has agreed . Our basic approach is clear . In the strategic arms reductions talks , we wish to reduce the risk of nuclear war . And in the companion defense and space talks , our objective will be to preserve our options to deploy advanced defenses when they are ready . In nuclear testing , we will continue to seek the necessary verification improvements in existing treaties to permit them to be brought into force . And we are going to continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons . We support NATO efforts to reduce the Soviet offensive threat in the negotiations on conventional forces in Europe . And as I have said , fundamental to all of these objectives is simple openness . Make no mistake , a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and the cities of the Soviet Union . Why not , then , let this spirit of openness grow , let more barriers come down . Open emigration , open debate , open airwaves let openness come to mean the publication and sale of banned books and newspapers in the Soviet Union . Let the 19 , 000 Soviet Jews who emigrated last year be followed by any number who wish to emigrate this year . And when people apply for exit visas , let there be no harassment against them . Let openness come to mean nothing less than the free exchange of people and books and ideas between East and West . And let it come to mean one thing more . Thirty four years ago , President Eisenhower met in Geneva with Soviet leaders who , after the death of Stalin , promised a new approach toward the West . He proposed a plan called Open Skies , which would allow unarmed aircraft from the United States and the Soviet Union to fly over the territory of the other country . This would open up military activities to regular scrutiny and , as President Eisenhower put it , convince the world that we are lessening danger and relaxing tension . President Eisenhower s suggestion tested the Soviet readiness to open their society , and the Kremlin failed that test . Now , let us again explore that proposal , but on a broader , more intrusive and radical basis one which I hope would include allies on both sides . We suggest that those countries that wish to examine this proposal meet soon to work out the necessary operational details , separately from other arms control negotiations . Such surveillance flights , complementing satellites , would provide regular scrutiny for both sides . Such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the true meaning of the concept of openness . The very Soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their commitment to change . Where there is cooperation , there can be a broader economic relationship but economic relations have been stifled by Soviet internal policies . They have been injured by Moscow s practice of using the cloak of commerce to steal technology from the West . Ending discriminatory treatment of firms would be a helpful step . Trade and financial transactions should take place on a normal commercial basis . And should the Soviet Union codify its emigration laws in accord with international standards and implement its new laws faithfully , I am prepared to work with Congress for a temporary waiver of the Jackson Vanik amendment , opening the way to extending most favored nation trade status to the Soviet Union . After that last weighty point , I can just imagine what you were thinking It had to happen . Your last day in college had to end with yet another political science lecture . In all seriousness , the policy I have just described has everything to do with you . Today you graduate . You are going to start careers and families , and you will become the leaders of America in the next century . And what kind of world will you know Perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of nations . It is a sad truth that nothing forces us to recognize our common humanity more swiftly than a natural disaster . I am thinking , of course , of Soviet Armenia just a few months ago , a tragedy without blame , warlike devastation without war . Our son took our 12 year old grandson to Yerevan . At the end of the day of comforting the injured and consoling the bereaved , the father and son went to church , sat down together in the midst of the ruins , and wept . How can our two countries magnify this simple expression of caring How can we convey the good will of our people Forty three years ago , a young lieutenant by the name of Albert Kotzebue , the class of 1945 at Texas A and was the first American soldier to shake hands with the Soviets at the bank of the Elbe River . Once again , we are ready to extend our hand . Once again , we are ready for a hand in return . And once again , it is a time for peace . Thank you for inviting me to Texas A and I wish you the very best in years to come . God bless you all . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Thank you all very much . Thank you , thank you very much . And I am proud to receive and I am honored to accept your nomination for President of the United States . May I thank my dear friend and our great leader , Bob Dole , for that wonderful introduction . Let me say this This nomination s not for me alone . It is for the ideas , principles , and values that we stand for . My job has been made easier by a leader who is taken a lot of unfair criticism with grace and humor , the Vice President of the United States , Dan Quayle . And I am very grateful to him . I want to talk tonight about the sharp choice that I intend to offer Americans this fall , a choice between different agendas , different directions , and yes , a choice about the character of the man you want to lead this Nation . I know that Americans have many questions about our economy , about our country s future , even questions about me . I will answer them tonight . First , I feel great . And I am heartened by the polls , the ones that say that I look better in my jogging shorts than the Governor of Arkansas . Four years ago , I spoke about missions for my life and for our country . I spoke of one urgent mission , defending our security and promoting the American ideal abroad . Just pause for a moment to reflect on what we have done . Germany is united , and a slab of the Berlin Wall sits right outside this Astrodome . Arabs and Israelis now sit face to face and talk peace , and every hostage held in Lebanon is free . The conflict in El Salvador is over , and free elections brought democracy to Nicaragua . Black and white South Africans cheered each other at the Olympics . The Soviet Union can only be found in history books . The captive nations of Eastern Europe and the Baltics are captive no more . And today on the rural streets of Poland , merchants sell cans of air labeled the last breath of communism . If I had stood before you 4 years ago and described this as the world we would help to build , you would have said , George Bush , you must have been smoking something , and you must have inhaled . This convention is the first at which an American President can say the cold war is over , and freedom finished first . Audience members . S . A . S . A . S . A . The President . We have a lot to be proud of , a lot . Some want to rewrite history , want to skip over the struggle , claim the outcome was inevitable . And while the postwar strategy was largely bipartisan , the fact remains that the liberal McGovern wing of the other party , including my opponent , consistently made the wrong choices . In the seventies , they wanted a hollow army . We wanted a strong fighting force . In the eighties and you remember this one in the eighties , they wanted a nuclear freeze , and we insisted on peace through strength . From Angola to Central America , they said , Let us negotiate , deliberate , procrastinate . We said , Just stand up for freedom . Now the cold war is over , and they claim , Hey , we were with you all the way . Audience members . Boo o o The President . You know , their behavior reminds me of the old con man s advice to the new kid . He said , Son , if you are being run out of town , just get out in front and make it look like a parade . Well , make no mistake The demise of communism was not a sure thing . It took the strong leadership of Presidents from both parties , including Republicans like Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan . Without their vision and the support of the American people , the Soviet Union would be a strong superpower today , and we had be facing a nuclear threat tonight . My opponents say I spend too much time on foreign policy , as if it did not matter that schoolchildren once hid under their desks in drills to prepare for nuclear war . I saw the chance to rid our children s dreams of the nuclear nightmare , and I did . Over the past 4 years , more people have breathed the fresh air of freedom than in all of human history . I saw a chance to help , and I did . These were the two defining opportunities not of a year , not of a decade , but of an entire span of human history . I seized those opportunities for our kids and our grandkids , and I make no apologies for that . Now , the Soviet bear may be gone , but there are still wolves in the woods . We saw that when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait . The Mideast might have become a nuclear powder keg , our energy supplies held hostage . So we did what was right and what was necessary . We destroyed a threat , freed a people , and locked a tyrant in the prison of his own country . What about the leader of the Arkansas National Guard , the man who hopes to be Commander in Chief Well , I bit the bullet , and he bit his nails . Listen to this now . Two days after Congress followed my lead , my opponent said this , and I quote directly I guess I would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote . But I agree with the arguments the minority made . Now , sounds to me like his policy can be summed up by a road sign he is probably seen on his bus tour , Slippery When Wet . Look , this is serious business . Think about the impact of our foreign policy failures the last time the Democrats controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue gas lines , grain embargoes , American hostages blindfolded . There will be more foreign policy challenges like Kuwait in the next 4 years , terrorists and aggressors to stand up to , dangerous weapons to be controlled and destroyed . Freedom s fight is not finished . I look forward to being the first President to visit a free , democratic Cuba . Who will lead the world in the face of these challenges Not my opponent . In his acceptance speech he devoted just 65 seconds to telling us about the world . Then he said that America was , and I quote again I want to be fair and factual I quote , being ridiculed everywhere . Well , tell that to the people around the world , for whom America is still a dream . Tell that to leaders around the world , from whom America commands respect . Ridiculed Tell that to the men and women of Desert Storm . Audience members . S . A . S . A . S . A . The President . Let me just make an aside comment here because of what you have been reading in the paper . This is a political year , but there is a lot of danger in the world . You can be sure I will never let politics interfere with a foreign policy decision . Forget the election I will do right , what is right for the national security of the United States of America , and that is a pledge from my heart . Fifty years ago this summer , I was 18 years of age . I see some young people in the audience tonight , and I remember how I felt in those days . I believed deeply in this country , and we were faced with a world war . So I made a decision to go off and fight a battle much different from political battles . I was scared , but I was willing . I was young , but I was ready . I had barely lived when I began to watch men die . I began to see the special place of America in the world . I began to see , even then , that the world would become a much smaller place , and faraway places could become more and more like America . Fifty years later , after change of almost Biblical proportions , we know that when freedom grows , America grows . Just as a strong America means a safer world , we have learned that a safer world means a stronger America . This election is about change . But that is not unusual , because the American revolution is never ending . Today , the pace of change is accelerating . We face new opportunities and new challenges . The question is Who do you trust to make change work for you Audience members . George Bush George Bush George Bush The President . My opponent says America is a nation in decline . Of our economy , he says we are somewhere on the list beneath Germany , heading south toward Sri Lanka . Well , do not let anyone tell you that America is second rate , especially somebody running for President . Maybe he has not heard that we are still the world s largest economy . No other nation sells more outside its borders . The Germans , the British , the Japanese cannot touch the productivity of you , the American worker and the American farmer . My opponent will not mention that . He will not remind you that interest rates are the lowest they have been in 20 years , and millions of Americans have refinanced their homes . You just will not hear that inflation , the thief of the middle class , has been locked in a maximum security prison . You do not hear much about this good news because the media also tends to focus only on the bad . When the Berlin Wall fell , I half expected to see a headline , Wall Falls , Three Border Guards Lose Jobs . And underneath , it probably says , Clinton Blames Bush . You do not hear a lot about progress in America . So let me tell you about some good things we have done together . Just two weeks ago , all three nations of North America agreed to trade freely from Manitoba to Mexico . This will bring good jobs to Main Street , S . We passed the Americans with Disabilities Act , bringing 43 million people into the economic mainstream . I must say , it is about time . Our children will breathe easier because of our new clean air pact . We are rebuilding our roads , providing jobs for more than half a million Americans . We passed a child care law , and we took a stand for family values by saying that when it comes to raising children , Government does not know best parents know best . I have fought against prejudice and anti Semitism all my life . I am proud that we strengthened our civil rights laws , and we did it without resorting to quotas . One more thing of vital importance to all Today , cocaine use has fallen by 60 percent among young people . To the teenagers , the parents , and the volunteers who are helping us battle the scourge of drugs in America , we say , thank you thank you from the bottom of our hearts . Do I want to do more You bet . Nothing hurts me more than to meet with soldiers home from the Persian Gulf who cannot find a job or workers who have a job but worry that the next day will bring a pink slip . And what about parents who scrape and struggle to send their kids to college , only to find them back living at home because they cannot get work . The world is in transition , and we are feeling that transition in our homes . The defining challenge of the nineties is to win the economic competition , to win the peace . We must be a military superpower , an economic superpower , and an export superpower . In this election , you will hear two versions of how to do this . Theirs is to look inward and protect what we already have . Ours is to look forward , to open new markets , prepare our people to compete , to restore our social fabric , to save and invest so we can win . We believe that now that the world looks more like America , it is time for America to look more like herself . And so we offer a philosophy that puts faith in the individual , not the bureaucracy a philosophy that empowers people to do their best , so America can be at its best . In a world that is safer and freer , this is how we will build an America that is stronger , safer , and more secure . We start with a simple fact Government is too big and spends too much . I have asked Congress to put a lid on mandatory spending , except Social Security . I have proposed doing away with over 200 programs and 4 , 000 wasteful projects and to freeze all other spending . The gridlock Democrat Congress said no . Audience members . Boo o o The President . So , beginning tonight , I will enforce the spending freeze on my own . If Congress sends me a bill spending more than I asked for in my budget , I will veto it fast , veto it fast , faster than copies of Millie s book sold . Now , Congress will not cut spending , but refuses to give the President the power to eliminate pork barrel projects that waste your money . Forty three Governors have that power . So I ask you , the American people Give me a Congress that will give me the line item veto . Let me tell you about a recent battle fought with the Congress , a battle in which I was aided by Bob Michel and his troops , and Bob Dole and his . This spring , I worked day and night to get two thirds of the House Members to approve a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution . We almost had it , but we lost by just nine votes . Now , listen how . Just before the vote , the liberal leaders of the Congress convinced 12 Members who cosponsored the bill to switch sides and vote no . Keep in mind , they voted against a bill they had already put their names on . Something fishy is going on . And look at my opponent on this issue . Look at my opponent . He says he is for balanced budgets . But he came out against the amendment . He is like that on a lot of issues , first on one side , then the other . He is been spotted in more places than Elvis Presley . After all these years , Congress has become pretty creative at finding ways to waste your money . So we need to be just as creative at finding ways to stop them . I have a brandnew idea . Taxpayers should be given the right to check a box on their tax returns so that up to 10 percent of their payments can go for one purpose alone to reduce the national debt . But we also need to make sure that Congress does not just turn around and borrow more money to spend more money . So I will require that for every tax dollar set aside to cut the debt , the ceilings on spending will be cut by an equal amount . That way , we will cut both debt and spending and take a whack out of the budget deficit . My feelings about big government come from my experience I spent half my adult life in the private sector . My opponent has a different experience he is been in government nearly all his life . His passion to expand government knows no bounds . He is already proposed , and listen to this carefully , he has already proposed 220 billion in new spending , along with the biggest tax increase in history , 150 billion . And that is just to start . Audience members . Boo o o The President . He says he wants to tax the rich . But folks , he defines rich as anyone who has a job . You have heard of the separations of powers . Well , my opponent practices a different theory the power of separations . Government has the power to separate you from your wallet . Now let me say this When it comes to taxes , I have learned the hard way . There is an old saying , Good judgment comes from experience , and experience comes from bad judgment . Two years ago , I made a bad call on the Democrats tax increase . I underestimated Congress addiction to taxes . With my back against the wall , I agreed to a hard bargain One tax increase one time in return for the toughest spending limits ever . Well , it was a mistake to go along with the Democratic tax increase , and I admit it . But here s the question for the American people . Who do you trust in this election The candidate who is raised taxes one time and regrets it , or the other candidate who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed it every time Audience members . Viva Bush Viva Bush Viva Bush The President . Thank you very much . Audience members . Hit em again Hit em again , harder , harder Hit em again Hit em again , harder , harder The President . When the new Congress convenes next January , I will propose to further reduce taxes across the board , provided we pay for these cuts with specific spending reductions that I consider appropriate , so that we do not increase the deficit . I will also continue to fight to increase the personal exemption and to create jobs by winning a cut in capital gains taxes . That will especially help small businesses . You know , they create small businesses they create two thirds of the new jobs in America . But my opponent s plan for small business is clear , present , and dangerous . Beside new income taxes , his plan will lead to a new payroll tax to pay for a Government takeover of health care and another new tax to pay for training . That is just the beginning . If he gets his way , hardware stores across America will have a new sign up , Closed for despair . I guess you had say his plan really is Elvis economics . America will be checking into the Heartbreak Hotel . I believe that small business needs relief from taxation , regulation , and litigation . And thus , I will extend for one year the freeze on paperwork and unnecessary Federal regulation that I imposed last winter . There is no reason that Federal regulations should live longer than my friend George Burns . I will issue an order to get rid of any rule whose time has come and gone . I see something happening in our towns and in our neighborhoods . Sharp lawyers are running wild . Doctors are afraid to practice medicine , and some moms and pops will not even coach Little League any more . We must sue each other less and care for each other more . I am fighting to reform our legal system , to put an end to crazy lawsuits . If that means climbing into the ring with the trial lawyers , well , let me just say , round one starts tonight . After all , my opponent s campaign is being backed by practically every trial lawyer who ever wore a tasselled loafer . He is not in the ring with them he is in the tank . There are other things we need to do to get our economy up to speed , prepare our kids for the next century . We must have new incentives for research and new training for workers . Small businesses need capital and credit , and defense workers need new jobs . I have a plan to provide affordable health care for every American , controlling costs by cutting paperwork and lawsuits and expanding coverage to the poorest of the poor . We do not need my opponent s plan for a massive Government takeover of health care , which would ration care and deny you the right to choose a doctor . Who wants health care with a system with the efficiency of the House post office and the compassion of the KGB What about our schools What about our schools My opponent and I both want to change the way our kids learn . He wants to change our schools a little bit , and I want to change them a lot . Take the issue of whether parents should be able to choose the best school for their kids . My opponent says that is okay , as long as the school is run by government . And I say every parent and child should have a real choice of schools , public , private , or religious . So we have a clear choice to fix our problems . Do we turn to the tattered blanket of bureaucracy that other nations are tossing away Or do we give our people the freedom and incentives to build security for themselves Here s what I am fighting for Open markets for American products lower Government spending tax relief opportunities for small business legal and health reform job training and new schools built on competition , ready for the 21st century . Now , okay , why are these proposals not in effect today Only one reason the gridlock Democratic Congress . Audience members . Clean your House Clean your House Clean your House The President . A very good idea , a very good idea . Now , I know Americans are tired of the blame game , tired of people in Washington acting like they are candidates for the next episode of American Gladiators . I do not like it , either . Neither should you . But the truth is the truth . Our policies have not failed . They have not even been tried . Americans want jobs , and on January 28th , I put before Congress a plan to create jobs . If it had been passed back then , 500 , 000 more Americans would be at work right now . But in a Nation that demands action , Congress has become the master of inaction . It was not always this way . I heard President Ford tonight . I served in Congress 22 years ago , under him . And back then , we cooperated . We did not get personal . We put the people above everything else . Heck , we did not even own blow dryers back in those days . At my first Inauguration , I said that people did not send us to bicker . I extended my hand , and I think the American people know this , I extended my hand to the congressional leaders , the Democratic leaders , and they bit it . The House leadership has not changed in 38 years . It is a body caught in a hopelessly tangled web of PAC s , perks , privileges , partnership , and paralysis . Every day , Congress puts politics ahead of principle and above progress . Now , let me give you just one example February 20th , 1991 . It was at the height of the Gulf war . On that very same day , I asked American pilots to risk their lives to fly missions over Baghdad . I also wanted to strengthen our economic security for the future . So that very same day , I introduced a new domestic energy strategy which would cut our dependence on foreign oil by 7 million barrels a day . How many days did it take to win the Gulf war Forty three . How many did it take Congress to pass a national energy strategy Five hundred and thirty two , and still counting . I have ridden stationary bikes that can move faster than the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate , controlled by the Democrat leadership . Audience members . Hit em again Hit em again , harder , harder Hit em again Hit em again , harder , harder The President . Okay . All right . You wait . I am fixing to . Where does my opponent stand with Congress Well , up in New York at their convention , they kept the congressional leaders away from the podium , hid them away . They did not want America to hear from the people who really make the decisions . They hid them for a very good reason , because the American people would recognize a dangerous combination a rubber check Congress and a rubber stamp President . Governor Clinton and Congress know that you have caught on to their lingo . They know when they say spending , you say uh oh . So now they have a new word , investment . They want to invest 220 billion more of your money , but I want you to keep it . Governor Clinton and Congress want to put through the largest tax increase in history , but I will not let that happen . Governor Clinton and Congress do not want kids to have the option of praying in school , but I do . Clinton and Congress do not want to close legal loopholes and keep criminals behind bars , but I will . Clinton and Congress will stock the judiciary with liberal judges who write laws they cannot get approved by the voters . Governor Clinton even says that Mario Cuomo belongs on the Supreme Court . Wait a minute , though . No , wait . Maybe not a bad idea . If you believe in judicial restraint , you probably ought to be happy . After all , the good Governor of New York cannot make up his mind between chocolate and vanilla at Baskin Robbins . He is there , we will not have another court decision for 35 years , and maybe that is all right , too . Are my opponent and Congress really in cahoots Look at one important question Should we limit the terms of Congress Audience members . Yes . The President . Governor Clinton says no . Congress says no . I say yes . We tried this look , we tried this once before , combining the Democratic Governor of a small southern State with a very liberal Vice President and a Democratic Congress . America does not need Carter IWe do not want to take America back to those days of malaise . But Americans want to know Where is proof that we will have better days in Washington I will give you 150 reasons . That is how many Members of Congress are expected to leave Washington this year . Some are tainted by scandal the voters have bounced them the way they bounced their own checks . But others are good Members , Republican and Democrat , and they agree with me . The place just does not work anymore . One hundred fifty new Members , from both parties , will be coming to Washington this fall . Every one will have a fresh view of America s future . I pledge today to the American people , immediately after this election , I will meet with every one of these Members , before they get attacked by the PAC s , overwhelmed by their staffs , and cornered by some camera crew . I will lay out my case for change , change that matters , real change that makes a difference , change that is right for America . You see , there is a yearning in America , a feeling that maybe it is time to get back to our roots . Sure we must change , but some values are timeless . I believe in families that stick together , fathers who stick around . I happen to believe very deeply in the worth of each individual human being , born or unborn . I believe in teaching our kids the difference between what is wrong and what is right , teaching them respect for hard work and to love their neighbors . I believe that America will always have a special place in God s heart , as long as He has a special place in ours . Maybe that is why I have always believed that patriotism is not just another point of view . There are times in every young person s life when God introduces you to yourself . I remember such a time . It was back many years ago , when I stood watch at 4 a . m . up on the bridge of a submarine , the United States Finback , S . Finback . And I would stand there and look out on the blackness of the sky , broken only by the sparkling stars above . And I would think about friends I lost , a country I loved , and about a girl named Barbara . I remember those nights as clearly as any in my life . You know , you can see things from up there that other people do not see . You can see storm clouds rise and then disappear , the first hint of the sun over the horizon , and the first outline of the shore far away . Now , I know that Americans are uneasy today . There is anxious talk around our kitchen tables . But from where I stand , I see not America s sunset but a sunrise . The world changes for which we have sacrificed for a generation have finally come to pass , and with them a rare and unprecedented opportunity to pass the sweet cup of prosperity around our American table . Are we up to it I know we are . As I travel our land , I meet veterans who once worked the turrets of a tank and can now master the keyboards of high tech economy . I see teachers blessed with the incredible American capacity for innovation who are teaching our children a new way to learn for a new century . I meet parents , some working two jobs with hectic schedules , who still find new ways to teach old values to steady their kids in a turbulent world . I take heart from what is happening in America , not from those who profess a new passion for government but from those with an old and enduring faith in the human potential , those who understand that the genius of America is our capacity for rebirth and renewal . America is the land where the sun is always peeking over the horizon . Tonight I appeal to that unyielding , undying , undeniable American spirit . I ask you to consider , now that the entire world is moving our way , why would we want to go back their way I ask not just for your support for my agenda but for your commitment to renew and rebuild our Nation by shaking up the one institution that has withstood change for over four decades . Join me in rolling away the roadblock at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , so that in the next 4 years , we will match our accomplishments outside by building a stronger , safer , more secure America inside . Forty four years ago in another age of uncertainty a different President embarked on a similar mission . His name was Harry S Truman . As he stood before his party to accept their nomination , Harry Truman knew the freedom I know this evening , the freedom to talk about what is right for America , and let the chips fall where they may . Harry Truman said this This is more than a political call to arms . Give me your help , not to win votes alone , but to win this new crusade and keep America safe and secure for its own people . Well , tonight I say to you Join me in our new crusade , to reap the rewards of our global victory , to win the peace , so that we may make America safer and stronger for all our people . May God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Speaker and President , distinguished members of Congress , honored guests , and fellow citizens Thank you very much for that warm reception . You know , with the big buildup this address has had , I wanted to make sure it would be a big hit , but I could not convince Barbara to deliver it for me . I see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing . They saw what I did in Japan , and they are just happy they are sitting behind me . I mean to speak tonight of big things , of big changes and the promises they hold , and of some big problems and how , together , we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age . We gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on Earth . For in the past 12 months , the world has known changes of almost biblical proportions . And even now , months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system , I am not sure we have absorbed the full impact , the full import of what happened . But communism died this year . Even as President , with the most fascinating possible vantage point , there were times when I was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that I did not always show the joy that was in my heart . But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life , in our lives , is this By the grace of God , America won the Cold War . I mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country , now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower . Now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right . I will speak of those things . But let me tell you something I have been thinking these past few months . It is a kind of rollcall of honor . For the Cold War did not end it was won . And I think of those who won it , in places like Korea and Vietnam . And some of them did not come back . Back then they were heroes , but this year they were victors . The long rollcall , all the Joes and Janes , all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom , who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror . This may seem frivolous , and I do not mean it so , but it is moving to me how the world saw them . The world saw not only their special valor but their special style their rambunctious , optimistic bravery , their do or die unity unhampered by class or race or region . What a group we have put forth , for generations now , from the ones who wrote Kilroy was here on the walls of the German stalags to those who left signs in the Iraqi desert that said , I saw Elvis . What a group of kids we have sent out into the world . And there is another to be singled out , though it may seem inelegant , and I mean a mass of people called the American taxpayer . No one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country s bill or an alliance s bill . But for half a century now , the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed . But it did does not anymore . And here s a fact I would not mind the world acknowledging The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory . So now , for the first time in 35 years , our strategic bombers stand down . No longer are they on round the clock alert . Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow . And they will not have , as my children did , air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war . My grandchildren do not have to do that and will not have the bad dreams children had once , in decades past . There are still threats . But the long , drawn out dread is over . A year ago tonight , I spoke to you at a moment of high peril . American forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm . And after 40 days in the desert skies and four days on the ground , the men and women of America s armed forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared and that you endorsed We liberated Kuwait . Soon after , the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace , an historic first . And soon after that , at Christmas , the last American hostages came home . Our policies were vindicated . Much good can come from the prudent use of power . And much good can come of this A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power , the United States of America . And they regard this with no dread . For the world trusts us with power , and the world is right . They trust us to be fair and restrained . They trust us to be on the side of decency . They trust us to do what is right . I use those words advisedly . A few days after the war began , I received a telegram from Joanne Speicher , the wife of the first pilot killed in the Gulf , Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher . Even in her grief , she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough , she would tell them that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do . And she said it all It was the right thing to do . And we did it together . There were honest differences right here in this chamber . But when the war began , you put partisanship aside , and we supported our troops . This is still a time for pride , but this is no time to boast . For problems face us , and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down . Two years ago , I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era . But now , this year , with imperial communism gone , that process can be accelerated . Tonight I can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force . These are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do . After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement , we will shut down further production of the B 2 bombers . We will cancel the small ICBM program . We will cease production of new warheads for our sea based ballistic missiles . We will stop all new production of the Peacekeeper missile . And we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles . This weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation . I have informed President Yeltsin that if the Commonwealth , the former Soviet Union , will eliminate all land based multiple warhead ballistic missiles , I will do the following We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles . We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea based missiles by about one third . And we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use . President Yeltsin s early response has been very positive , and I expect our talks at Camp David to be fruitful . I want you to know that for half a century , American Presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words . But even in the midst of celebration , we must keep caution as a friend . For the world is still a dangerous place . Only the dead have seen the end of conflict . And though yesterday s challenges are behind us , tomorrow s are being born . The Secretary of Defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff . And I make them with confidence . But do not misunderstand me . The reductions I have approved will save us an additional 50 billion over the next five years . By 1997 , we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office . These cuts are deep , and you must know my resolve This deep , and no deeper . To do less would be insensible to progress , but to do more would be ignorant of history . We must not go back to the days of the hollow army . We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe . I remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack . We must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms . And I urge you again to pass the Strategic Defense Initiative , SDThere are those who say that now we can turn away from the world , that we have no special role , no special place . But we are the United States of America , the leader of the West that has become the leader of the world . And as long as I am President , I will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere , not out of arrogance , not out of altruism , but for the safety and security of our children . This is a fact Strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue . And now to our troubles at home . They are not all economic the primary problem is our economy . There are some good signs . Inflation , that thief , is down . And interest rates are down . But unemployment is too high , some industries are in trouble , and growth is not what it should be . Let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart , I know we are in hard times . But I know something else This will not stand . In this chamber , in this chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm . And we can defeat hard times together . I believe you will help . One reason is that you are patriots , and you want the best for your country . And I believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because it is the right thing to do . The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea , that people will do great things if only you set them free . Well , we are going to set the economy free . For if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything , it is that if we can change the world we can change America . We must encourage investment . We must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products , new industries , and new jobs . We must clear away the obstacles to growth high taxes , high regulation , redtape , and yes , wasteful government spending . None of this will happen with a snap of the fingers , but it will happen . And the test of a plan is not whether it is called new or dazzling . The American people are not impressed by gimmicks they are smarter on this score than all of us in this room . The only test of a plan is Is it sound , and will it work We must have a short term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy . And then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy . There are certain things that a President can do without Congress , and I am going to do them . I have , this evening , asked major Cabinet departments and federal agencies to institute a 90 day moratorium on any new federal regulations that could hinder growth . In those 90 days , major departments and agencies will carry out a top to bottom review of all regulations , old and new , to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth . Further , for the untold number of hard working , responsible American workers and business men and women who have been forced to go without needed bank loans , the banking credit crunch must end . I will not neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good , but regulatory overkill must be stopped . And I have instructed our government regulators to stop it . I have directed Cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible . This should put an extra 10 billion into the economy in the next six months . And our new transportation bill provides more than 150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well being . And that means jobs building roads , jobs building bridges , and jobs building railways . And I have , this evening , directed the Secretary of the Treasury to change the federal tax withholding tables . With this change , millions of Americans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks . Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one . This initiative could return about 25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months , money people can use to help pay for clothing , college , or to get a new car . Finally , working with the Federal Reserve , we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down . Now , these are the things I can do . And now , members of Congress , let me tell you what you can do for your country . You must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs . Everyone knows that investment spurs recovery . I am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15 percent investment tax allowance . This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work . Real estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we have ever had . Once building starts , carpenters and plumbers work people buy homes and take out mortgages . My plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developers . And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate . For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who cannot quite afford it , my plan would allow first time homebuyers to withdraw savings from IRAs without penalty and provide a 5 , 000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home . And finally , my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to people who own a home , to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment . This time , at this hour , I cannot take no for an answer . You must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country . Never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents . But the demagogs are wrong . They are wrong , and they know it . Sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under 50 , 000 . A cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country . And so , I am asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15 . 4 percent . I will tell you , those of you who say , Oh , no , someone who is comfortable may benefit from that , you kind of remind me of the old definition of the Puritan who could not sleep at night , worrying that somehow , someone somewhere was out having a good time . The opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so called soak the rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be reminded of something When they aim at the big guy , they usually hit the little guy . And maybe it is time that stopped . This , then , is my short term plan . Your part , members of Congress , requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates . While my plan is being passed and kicking in , we have got to care for those in trouble today . I have provided for up to 4 . 4 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefits . And I ask for congressional action right away . And I thank the committee . Well , at last . Let us be frank . Let us be frank . Let me level with you . I know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season . I know and you know that everything I propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms . But I ask you to know what is in my heart . And my aim is to increase our nation s good . I am doing what I think is right , and I am proposing what I know will help . I pride myself that I am a prudent man , and I believe that patience is a virtue . But I understand that politics is , for some , a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement . But let me tell you Far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is the well being of our country . Members of this chamber are practical people , and I know you will not resent some practical advice . When people put their party s fortunes , whatever the party , whatever side of this aisle , before the public good , they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves . And they will certainly deserve it . I submit my plan tomorrow , and I am asking you to pass it by March 20 . And I ask the American people to let you know they want this action by March 20 . From the day after that , if it must be , the battle is joined . And you know , when principle is at stake I relish a good , fair fight . I said my plan has two parts , and it does . And it is the second part that is the heart of the matter . For it is not enough to get an immediate burst . We need long term improvement in our economic position . We all know that the key to our economic future is to ensure that America continues as an economic leader of the world . We have that in our power . Here , then , is my long term plan to guarantee our future . First , trade We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade . We will work to open markets everywhere . And in our major trade negotiations , I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America s farmers and workers . And we will get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American free trade agreement and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative . But changes are here , and more are coming . The workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever , more people who are computer literate , highly educated . We must be the world s leader in education . And we must revolutionize America s schools . My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal . My plan will give parents more choice , give teachers more flexibility , and help communities create new American schools . Thirty states across the nation have established America 2000 programs . Hundreds of cities and towns have joined in . Now Congress must join this great movement Pass my proposals for new American schools . That was my second long term proposal , and here s my third We must make commonsense investments that will help us compete , long term , in the marketplace . We must encourage research and development . My plan is to make the R and D tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support , over 76 billion this year alone , for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies . Fourth , we must do something about crime and drugs . It is time for a major , renewed investment in fighting violent street crime . It saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together . Surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely . And surely it is true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime , from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for , surely these people have been denied a basic civil right . It is time to restore it . Congress , pass my comprehensive crime bill . It is tough on criminals and supportive of police , and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now . Pass it . Help your country . Fifth , I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city . We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home , getting a job , becoming a part of things . My plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low income housing . And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence , Head Start . Step six , we must reform our health care system . For this , too , bears on whether or not we can compete in the world . American health costs have been exploding . This year America will spend over 800 billion on health , and that is expected to grow to 1 . 6 trillion by the end of the decade . We simply cannot afford this . The cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell . When health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars , the cost goes into the products he makes , and you pay the bill . We must make a choice . Now , some pretend we can have it both ways . They call it play or pay , but that expensive approach is unstable . It will mean higher taxes , fewer jobs , and eventually a system under complete government control . Really , there are only two options . And we can move toward a nationalized system , a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the government to ration services arbitrarily . And what we will get is patients in long lines , indifferent service , and a huge new tax burden . Or we can reform our own private health care system , which still gives us , for all its flaws , the best quality health care in the world . Well , let us build on our strengths . My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice . We make basic health insurance affordable for all low income people not now covered , and we do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to 3 , 750 for each low income family . And the middle class gets help , too . And by reforming the health insurance market , my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems . We must bring costs under control , preserve quality , preserve choice , and reduce the people s nagging daily worry about health insurance . My plan , the details of which I will announce very shortly , does just that . Seventh , we must get the federal deficit under control . We now have , in law , enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create . There are those in Congress who would ease that discipline now . But I cannot let them do it , and I will not . My plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority , which means no more next year than this year . I will not tamper with Social Security , but I would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending . And I would also freeze federal domestic government employment . And with the help of Congress , my plan will get rid of 246 programs that do not deserve federal funding . Some of them have noble titles , but none of them is indispensable . We can get rid of each and every one of them . You know , it is time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have never forgotten This government is too big and spends too much . And I call upon Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork barrel appropriations . Every year , the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples a Lawrence Welk museum , research grants for Belgian endive . We all know how these things get into the budget , and maybe you need someone to help you say no . I know how to say it , and I know what I need to make it stick . Give me the same thing 43 Governors have , the line item veto , and let me help you control spending . We must put an end to unfinanced federal government mandates . These are the requirements Congress puts on our cities , counties , and states without supplying the money . If Congress passes a mandate , it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere . After all , a mandate just increases someone else s burden , and that means higher taxes at the state and local level . Step eight , Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action bank reform , civil justice reform , tort reform , and my national energy strategy . And finally , we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future . When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in her arms and reads to children , she is saying to every person in this country Family matters . And I am announcing tonight a new Commission on America s Urban Families . I have asked Missouri s Governor John Ashcroft to be Chairman , former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss to be Cochair . You know , I had mayors , the leading mayors from the League of Cities , in the other day at the White House , and they told me something striking . They said that every one of them , Republican or Democrat , agreed on one thing , that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family . They asked for this Commission , and they were right to ask because it is time to determine what we can do to keep families together , strong and sound . There is one thing we can do right away Ease the burden of rearing a child . I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by 500 per child for every family . For a family with four kids , that is an increase of 2 , 000 . This is a good start in the right direction , and it is what we can afford . It is time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans . I am asking you to do just that . And I am asking you to allow people to use money from their IRAs to pay medical and education expenses , all without penalties . And I am asking for more . Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country , and chances are good that pretty soon they will get to welfare . Americans are the most generous people on Earth . But we have to go back to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who , when he spoke of what became the welfare program , warned that it must not become a narcotic and a subtle destroyer of the spirit . Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle . It was never meant to be a habit . It was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy . It is time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system . States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able bodied people receive government assistance , they have responsibilities to the taxpayer A responsibility to seek work , education , or job training a responsibility to get their lives in order a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock and a responsibility to obey the law . We are going to help this movement . Often , state reform requires waiving certain federal regulations . I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every state that asks for our help . I want to add , as we make these changes , we work together to improve this system , that our intention is not scapegoating or finger pointing . If you read the papers and watch Tyou know there is been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness racist comments , anti Semitism , an increased sense of division . Really , this is not us . This is not who we are . And this is not acceptable . And so , you have my plan for America . And I am asking for big things , but I believe in my heart you will do what is right . You know , it is kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions . I myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through Congress . You will deliberate , and you will discuss , and that is fine . But , my friends , the people cannot wait . They need help now . There is a mood among us . People are worried . There is been talk of decline . Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired . And I thought Really You go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon . Tell the men and women who put him there . Tell the American farmer who feeds his country and the world . Tell the men and women of Desert Storm . Moods come and go , but greatness endures . Ours does . And maybe for a moment it is good to remember what , in the dailiness of our lives , we forget We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth , the kindest nation on Earth , the strongest nation on Earth . And we have always risen to the occasion . And we are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day , and those who would stop us had better step aside . Because I look at hard times , and I make this vow This will not stand . And so , we move on together , a rising nation , the once and future miracle that is still , this night , the hope of the world . Thank you . God bless you , and God bless our beloved country . Thank you very , very much .<speech_sep>President , Speaker , members of the United States Congress I return as a former President of the Senate and a former member of this great House . And now , as President , it is my privilege to report to you on the state of the Union . Tonight I come not to speak about the state of the government , not to detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year nor to describe every line in the budget . I am here to speak to you and to the American people about the state of the Union , about our world the changes we have seen , the challenges we face and what that means for America . There are singular moments in history , dates that divide all that goes before from all that comes after . And many of us in this chamber have lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945 and the events of that year decreed the shape of nations , the pace of progress , freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world . Nineteen forty five provided the common frame of reference , the compass points of the postwar era we have relied upon to understand ourselves . And that was our world , until now . The events of the year just ended , the Revolution of 89 , have been a chain reaction , changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the world s affairs . Think back think back just 12 short months ago to the world we knew as 1989 began . One year one year ago , the people of Panama lived in fear , under the thumb of a dictator . Today democracy is restored Panama is free . Operation Just Cause has achieved its objective . The number of military personnel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the operation began . And tonight I am announcing that well before the end of February , the additional numbers of American troops , the brave men and women of our armed forces who made this mission a success , will be back home . A year ago in Poland , Lech Walesa declared that he was ready to open a dialog with the Communist rulers of that country and today , with the future of a free Poland in their own hands , members of Solidarity lead the Polish government . A year ago , freedom s playwright , Vaclav Havel , languished as a prisoner in Prague . And today it is Vaclav Havel , President of Czechoslovakia . And one year ago , Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his guide , and he predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years . And today , less than one year later , it is the Wall that is history . Remarkable events events that fulfill the long held hopes of the American people events that validate the longstanding goals of American policy , a policy based on a single , shining principle the cause of freedom . America , not just the nation but an idea , alive in the minds of people everywhere . As this new world takes shape , America stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom today , tomorrow , and into the next century . Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores , and the millions still struggling to be free . This nation , this idea called America , was and always will be a new world our new world . At a workers rally , in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague , the idea called America is alive . A worker , dressed in grimy overalls , rises to speak at the factory gates . He begins his speech to his fellow citizens with these words , words of a distant revolution We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , and that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . It is no secret that here at home freedom s door opened long ago . The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place democracy , competition , opportunity , private investment , stewardship , and of course leadership . And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours , a system second to none , and make it better a better America , where there is a job for everyone who wants one where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care and where government works to expand child care alternatives for parents where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy where Made in the USis recognized around the world as the symbol of quality and progress where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live , to work , and to contribute to society and where , for the first time , the American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens where everyone has a roof over his head and where the homeless get the help they need to live in dignity where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers and where all of them make the grade where every street , every city , every school , and every child is drug free and finally , where no American is forgotten our hearts go out to our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and in our efforts . That is part of the future we want to see , the future we can make for ourselves , but dreams alone will not get us there . We need to extend our horizon , commit to the long view . And our mission for the future starts today . In the tough competitive markets around the world , America faces the great challenges and great opportunities . And we know that we can succeed in the global economic arena of the nineties , but to meet that challenge , we must make some fundamental changes some crucial investment in ourselves . Yes , we are going to invest in America . This administration is determined to encourage the creation of capital , capital of all kinds physical capital everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines , all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services intellectual capital the source of ideas that spark tomorrow s products and of course our human capital the talented work force that we will need to compete in the global market . Let me tell you , if we ignore human capital , if we lose the spirit of American ingenuity , the spirit that is the hallmark of the American worker , that would be bad . The American worker is the most productive worker in the world . We need to save more . We need to expand the pool of capital for new investments that need more jobs and more growth . And that is the idea behind a new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan , which I will send to Congress tomorrow . We need to cut the tax on capital gains , encourage risktakers , especially those in our small businesses , to take those steps that translate into economic reward , jobs , and a better life for all of us . We will do what it takes to invest in America s future . The budget commitment is there . The money is there . It is there for research and development , R and D a record high . It is there for our housing initiative HOPE to help everyone from first time homebuyers to the homeless . The money s there to keep our kids drug free 70 percent more than when I took office in 1989 . It is there for space exploration . And it is there for education another record high . And one more thing Last fall at the education summit , the Governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom . And I have made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds an extra half a billion dollars for something near and dear to all of us Head Start . Education is the one investment that means more for our future because it means the most for our children . Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more It is a matter of asking more expecting more of our schools , our teachers , of our kids , of our parents , and ourselves . And that is why tonight I am announcing America s education goals , goals developed with enormous cooperation from the Nation s Governors . And if I might , I had like to say I am very pleased that Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton , Governor Branstad , Governor Campbell , all of whom were very key in these discussions , these deliberations , are with us here tonight . By the year 2000 , every child must start school ready to learn . The United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than 90 percent . And we are going to make sure our schools diplomas mean something . In critical subjects at the 4th , 8th , and 12th grades we must assess our students performance . By the year 2000 , students must be first in the world in math and science achievement . Every American adult must be a skilled , literate worker and citizen . Every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn . And every school in America must be drug free . Ambitious aims Of course . Easy to do Far from it . But the future s at stake . The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education . These investments will keep America competitive . And I know this about the American people We welcome competition . We will match our ingenuity , our energy , our experience and technology , our spirit and enterprise against anyone . But let the competition be free , but let it also be fair . America is ready . Since we really mean it and since we are serious about being ready to meet that challenge , we are getting our own house in order . We have made real progress . Seven years ago , the federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross national product 6 percent . In the new budget I sent up two days ago , the deficit is down to 1 percent of gross national product . That budget brings federal spending under control . It meets the Gramm Rudman target . It brings that deficit down further and balances the budget by 1993 with no new taxes . And let me tell you , there is still more than enough federal spending . For most of us , 1 . 2 trillion is still a lot of money . And once the budget is balanced , we can operate the way every family must when it has bills to pay . We will not leave it to our children and our grandchildren . Once it is balanced , we will start paying off the national debt . And there is something more we owe the generations of the future stewardship , the safekeeping of America s precious environmental inheritance . It is just one sign of how serious we are . We will elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank not more bureaucracy , not more redtape , but the certainty that here at home , and especially in our dealings with other nations , environmental issues have the status they deserve . This year s budget provides over 2 billion in new spending to protect our environment , with over 1 billion for global change research , and a new initiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves that improve recreational facilities on public lands , and something else , something that will help keep this country clean from our forestland to the inner cities and keep America beautiful for generations to come the money to plant a billion trees a year . And tonight let me say again to all the members of the Congress The American people did not send us here to bicker . There is work to do , and they sent us here to get it done . And once again , in the spirit of cooperation , I offer my hand to all of you . Let us work together to do the will of the people clean air , child care , the Educational Excellence Act , crime , and drugs . It is time to act . The farm bill , transportation policy , product liability reform , enterprise zones it is time to act together . And there is one thing I hope we will be able to agree on . It is about our commitments . I am talking about Social Security . To every American out there on Social Security , to every American supporting that system today , and to everyone counting on it when they retire , we made a promise to you , and we are going to keep it . We rescued the system in 1983 , and it is sound again bipartisan arrangement . Our budget fully funds today s benefits , and it assures that future benefits will be funded as well . The last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security . There is one more problem we need to address . We must give careful consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies underway now . That is why tonight I am asking Sullivan , Lou Sullivan , Secretary of Health and Human Services , to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the quality , accessibility , and cost of our nation s health care system . I am committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control . The state of the government does indeed depend on many of us in this very chamber . But the state of the Union depends on all Americans . We must maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals . I have been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this country . Every one of us must confront and condemn racism , anti Semitism , bigotry , and hate , not next week , not tomorrow , but right now every single one of us . The state of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor claim the problems of our community as our own . We have got to step forward when there is trouble , lend a hand , be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need . We have got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids , help them with their homework , pass along the values we learned as children . That is how we sustain the state of the Union . Every effort is important . It all adds up . It is doing the things that give democracy meaning . It all adds up to who we are and who we will be . Let me say that so long as we remember the American idea , so long as we live up to the American ideal , the state of the Union will remain sound and strong . And to those who worry that we have lost our way well , I want you to listen to parts of a letter written by Private First Class James Markwell , a 20 year old Army medic of the 1st Battalion , 75th Rangers . It is dated December 18 , the night before our armed forces went into action in Panama . It is a letter servicemen write and hope will never be sent . And sadly , Private Markwell s mother did receive this letter . She passed it along to me out there in Cincinnati . And here is some of what he wrote I have never been afraid of death , but I know he is waiting at the corner . I have been trained to kill and to save , and so has everyone else . I am frightened what lays beyond the fog , and yet do not mourn for me . Revel in the life that I have died to give you . But most of all , do not forget the Army was my choice . Something that I wanted to do . Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and ensure that you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely . Let me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in Panama , and one of the first to fall . But he knew what he believed in . He carried the idea we call America in his heart . I began tonight speaking about the changes we have seen this past year . There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us , and there is a need for leadership that only America can provide . Nearly 40 years ago , in his last address to the Congress , President Harry Truman predicted such a time would come . He said As our world grows stronger , more united , more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain , then inevitably there will come a time of change within the Communist world . Today , that change is taking place . For more than 40 years , America and its allies held communism in check and ensured that democracy would continue to exist . And today , with communism crumbling , our aim must be to ensure democracy s advance , to take the lead in forging peace and freedom s best hope a great and growing commonwealth of free nations . And to the Congress and to all Americans , I say it is time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad , a common vision of the peaceful world we want to see . Here in our own hemisphere , it is time for all the peoples of the Americas , North and South , to live in freedom . In the Far East and Africa , it is time for the full flowering of free governments and free markets that have served as the engine of progress . It is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe so that continent for too long a continent divided can see a future whole and free . It is time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union , to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity . We are in a period of great transition , great hope , and yet great uncertainty . We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing , but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization . Therefore , we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative . But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe , a coherent defense program that ensures the will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe . And I have consulted with leaders of NATIn fact , I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just today . I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe . But our troop levels can still be lower . And so , tonight I am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in and Soviet manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195 , 000 on each side . This level reflects the advice of our senior military advisers . It is designed to protect American and European interests and sustain NATO s defense strategy . A swift conclusion to our arms control talks conventional , chemical , and strategic must now be our goal . And that time has come . Still , we must recognize an unfortunate fact In many regions of the world tonight , the reality is conflict , not peace . Enduring animosities and opposing interests remain . And thus , the cause of peace must be served by an America strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our ideals . It is this American idea that for the past four decades helped inspire this Revolution of 89 . Here at home and in the world , there is history in the making , history to be made . Six months ago , early in this season of change , I stood at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity . It is a monument of simple majesty . Three tall crosses rise up from the stones , and atop each cross , an anchor an ancient symbol of hope . The anchor in our world today is freedom , holding us steady in times of change , a symbol of hope to all the world . And freedom is at the very heart of the idea that is America . Giving life to that idea depends on every one of us . Our anchor has always been faith and family . In the last few days of this past momentous year , our family was blessed once more , celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th grandchild . When I held the little guy for the first time , the troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable and totally in perspective . Now , I know you are probably thinking , well , that is just a grandfather talking . Well , maybe you are right . But I have met a lot of children this past year across this country , as all of you have , everywhere from the Far East to Eastern Europe . And all kids are unique , and yet all kids are alike the budding young environmentalists I met this month who joined me in exploring the Florida Everglades the little leaguers I played catch with in Poland , ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series and even the kids who are ill or alone and God bless those boarder babies , born addicted to drugs and AIDS and coping with problems no child should have to face . But you know , when it comes to hope and the future , every kid is the same full of dreams , ready to take on the world all special , because they are the very future of freedom . And to them belongs this new world I have been speaking about . And so , tonight I am going to ask something of every one of you . Now , let me start with my generation , with the grandparents out there . You are our living link to the past . Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles waged at home and abroad , of sacrifices freely made for freedom s sake . And tell them your own story as well , because every American has a story to tell . And , parents , your children look to you for direction and guidance . Tell them of faith and family . Tell them we are one nation under God . Teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive liberty is their most precious legacy , and of all the gifts they can give the greatest is helping others . And to the children and young people out there tonight With you rests our hope , all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead . Fix your vision on a new century your century , on dreams we cannot see , on the destiny that is yours and yours alone . And finally , let all Americans all of us together here in this chamber , the symbolic center of democracy affirm our allegiance to this idea we call America . And let us remember that the state of the Union depends on each and every one of us . God bless all of you , and may God bless this great nation , the United States of America .<speech_sep>
