Good evening I have asked for this radio and television time tonight for the purpose of announcing that we today have concluded an agreement to end the war and bring peace with honor in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia . The following statement is being issued at this moment in Washington and Hanoi At 12 30 Paris time today , January 23 , 1973 , the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam was initialed by Henry Kissinger on behalf of the United States , and Special Adviser Le Duc Tho on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . The agreement will be formally signed by the parties participating in the Paris Conference on Vietnam on January 27 , 1973 , at the International Conference Center in Paris . The cease fire will take effect at 2400 Greenwich Mean Time , January 27 , 1973 . The United States and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam express the hope that this agreement will insure stable peace in Vietnam and contribute to the preservation of lasting peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia . That concludes the formal statement . Throughout the years of negotiations , we have insisted on peace with honor . In my addresses to the Nation from this room of January 25 and May 8 , I set forth the goals that we considered essential for peace with honor . In the settlement that has now been agreed to , all the conditions that I laid down then have been met A cease fire , internationally supervised , will begin at 7 p . m . , this Saturday , January 27 , Washington time . Within 60 days from this Saturday , all Americans held prisoners of war throughout Indochina will be released . There will be the fullest possible accounting for all of those who are missing in action . During the same 60 day period , all American forces will be withdrawn from South Vietnam . The people of South Vietnam have been guaranteed the right to determine their own future , without outside interference . By joint agreement , the full text of the agreement and the protocol to carry it out will be issued tomorrow . Throughout these negotiations we have been in the closest consultation with President Thieu and other representatives of the Republic of Vietnam . This settlement meets the goals and has the full support of President Thieu and the Government of the Republic of Vietnam , as well as that of our other allies who are affected . The United States will continue to recognize the Government of the Republic of Vietnam as the sole legitimate government of South Vietnam . We shall continue to aid South Vietnam within the terms of the agreement , and we shall support efforts by the people of South Vietnam to settle their problems peacefully among themselves . We must recognize that ending the war is only the first step toward building the peace . All parties must now see to it that this is a peace that lasts , and also a peace that heals and a peace that not only ends the war in Southeast Asia but contributes to the prospects of peace in the whole world . This will mean that the terms of the agreement must be scrupulously adhered to . We shall do everything the agreement requires of us , and we shall expect the other parties to do everything it requires of them . We shall also expect other interested nations to help insure that the agreement is carried out and peace is maintained . As this long and very difficult war ends , I would like to address a few special words to each of those who have been parties in the conflict . First , to the people and Government of South Vietnam By your courage , by your sacrifice , you have won the precious right to determine your own future , and you have developed the strength to defend that right . We look forward to working with you in the future friends in peace as we have been allies in war . To the leaders of North Vietnam As we have ended the war through negotiations , let us now build a peace of reconciliation . For our part , we are prepared to make a major effort to help achieve that goal . But just as reciprocity was needed to end the war , so too will it be needed to build and strengthen the peace . To the other major powers that have been involved even indirectly Now is the time for mutual restraint so that the peace we have achieved can last . And finally , to all of you who are listening , the American people Your steadfastness in supporting our insistence on peace with honor has made peace with honor possible . I know that you would not have wanted that peace jeopardized . With our secret negotiations at the sensitive stage they were in during this recent period , for me to have discussed publicly our efforts to secure peace would not only have violated our understanding with North Vietnam , it would have seriously harmed and possibly destroyed the chances for peace . Therefore , I know that you now can understand why , during these past several weeks , I have not made any public statements about those efforts . The important thing was not to talk about peace , but to get peace and to get the right kind of peace . This we have done . Now that we have achieved an honorable agreement , let us be proud that America did not settle for a peace that would have betrayed our allies , that would have abandoned our prisoners of war , or that would have ended the war for us but would have continued the war for the 50 million people of Indochina . Let us be proud of the 2 1 2 million young Americans who served in Vietnam , who served with honor and distinction in one of the most selfless enterprises in the history of nations . And let us be proud of those who sacrificed , who gave their lives so that the people of South Vietnam might live in freedom and so that the world might live in peace . In particular , I would like to say a word to some of the bravest people I have ever met the wives , the children , the families of our prisoners of war and the missing in action . When others called on us to settle on any terms , you had the courage to stand for the right kind of peace so that those who died and those who suffered would not have died and suffered in vain , and so that where this generation knew war , the next generation would know peace . Nothing means more to me at this moment than the fact that your long vigil is coming to an end . Just yesterday , a great American , who once occupied this office , died . In his life , President Johnson endured the vilification of those who sought to portray him as a man of war . But there was nothing he cared about more deeply than achieving a lasting peace in the world . I remember the last time I talked with him . It was just the day after New Year s . He spoke then of his concern with bringing peace , with making it the right kind of peace , and I was grateful that he once again expressed his support for my efforts to gain such a peace . No one would have welcomed this peace more than he . And I know he would join me in asking for those who died and for those who live let us consecrate this moment by resolving together to make the peace we have achieved a peace that will last . Thank you and good evening .<speech_sep>Senator Dirksen , Chief Justice , Vice President , President Johnson , Vice President Humphrey , my fellow Americans and my fellow citizens of the world community I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment . In the orderly transfer of power , we celebrate the unity that keeps us free . Each moment in history is a fleeting time , precious and unique . But some stand out as moments of beginning , in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries . This can be such a moment . Forces now are converging that make possible , for the first time , the hope that many of man s deepest aspirations can at last be realized . The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate , within our own lifetime , advances that once would have taken centuries . In throwing wide the horizons of space , we have discovered new horizons on earth . For the first time , because the people of the world want peace , and the leaders of the world are afraid of war , the times are on the side of peace . Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation . Within the lifetime of most people now living , mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years the beginning of the third millennium . What kind of nation we will be , what kind of world we will live in , whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes , is ours to determine by our actions and our choices . The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker . This honor now beckons America the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil , and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization . If we succeed , generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment , that we helped make the world safe for mankind . This is our summons to greatness . I believe the American people are ready to answer this call . The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement . We have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture . We have shared our wealth more broadly than ever . We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth . We have given freedom new reach , and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white . We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today . I know America s youth . I believe in them . We can be proud that they are better educated , more committed , more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history . No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society , or so possessed of the will to achieve it . Because our strengths are so great , we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope . Standing in this same place a third of a century ago , Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear . He could say in surveying the Nation s troubles They concern , thank God , only material things . Our crisis today is the reverse . We have found ourselves rich in goods , but ragged in spirit reaching with magnificent precision for the moon , but falling into raucous discord on earth . We are caught in war , wanting peace . We are torn by division , wanting unity . We see around us empty lives , wanting fulfillment . We see tasks that need doing , waiting for hands to do them . To a crisis of the spirit , we need an answer of the spirit . To find that answer , we need only look within ourselves . When we listen to the better angels of our nature , we find that they celebrate the simple things , the basic things such as goodness , decency , love , kindness . Greatness comes in simple trappings . The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us , and cement what unites us . To lower our voices would be a simple thing . In these difficult years , America has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading . We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices . For its part , government will listen . We will strive to listen in new ways to the voices of quiet anguish , the voices that speak without words , the voices of the heart to the injured voices , the anxious voices , the voices that have despaired of being heard . Those who have been left out , we will try to bring in . Those left behind , we will help to catch up . For all of our people , we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure . As we reach toward our hopes , our task is to build on what has gone before not turning away from the old , but turning toward the new . In this past third of a century , government has passed more laws , spent more money , initiated more programs , than in all our previous history . In pursuing our goals of full employment , better housing , excellence in education in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life in all these and more , we will and must press urgently forward . We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home . The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep . But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do . Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government , and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed . What has to be done , has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all . The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing with the people we can do everything . To match the magnitude of our tasks , we need the energies of our people enlisted not only in grand enterprises , but more importantly in those small , splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal . With these , we can build a great cathedral of the spirit each of us raising it one stone at a time , as he reaches out to his neighbor , helping , caring , doing . I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease . I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice . I ask you to join in a high adventure one as rich as humanity itself , and as exciting as the times we live in . The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny . Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself , no man is truly whole . The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use . As we measure what can be done , we shall promise only what we know we can produce , but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams . No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not . To go forward at all is to go forward together . This means black and white together , as one nation , not two . The laws have caught up with our conscience . What remains is to give life to what is in the law to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God , all are born equal in dignity before man . As we learn to go forward together at home , let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind . Let us take as our goal where peace is unknown , make it welcome where peace is fragile , make it strong where peace is temporary , make it permanent . After a period of confrontation , we are entering an era of negotiation . Let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open . We seek an open world open to ideas , open to the exchange of goods and people a world in which no people , great or small , will live in angry isolation . We cannot expect to make everyone our friend , but we can try to make no one our enemy . Those who would be our adversaries , we invite to a peaceful competition not in conquering territory or extending dominion , but in enriching the life of man . As we explore the reaches of space , let us go to the new worlds together not as new worlds to be conquered , but as a new adventure to be shared . With those who are willing to join , let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms , to strengthen the structure of peace , to lift up the poor and the hungry . But to all those who would be tempted by weakness , let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be . Over the past twenty years , since I first came to this Capital as a freshman Congressman , I have visited most of the nations of the world . I have come to know the leaders of the world , and the great forces , the hatreds , the fears that divide the world . I know that peace does not come through wishing for it that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy . I also know the people of the world . I have seen the hunger of a homeless child , the pain of a man wounded in battle , the grief of a mother who has lost her son . I know these have no ideology , no race . I know America . I know the heart of America is good . I speak from my own heart , and the heart of my country , the deep concern we have for those who suffer , and those who sorrow . I have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my countrymen to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States . To that oath I now add this sacred commitment I shall consecrate my office , my energies , and all the wisdom I can summon , to the cause of peace among nations . Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike The peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people , but the peace that comes with healing in its wings with compassion for those who have suffered with understanding for those who have opposed us with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny . Only a few short weeks ago , we shared the glory of man s first sight of the world as God sees it , as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness . As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon s gray surface on Christmas Eve , they spoke to us of the beauty of earth and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance , we heard them invoke God s blessing on its goodness . In that moment , their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write To see the earth as it truly is , small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats , is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together , brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold brothers who know now they are truly brothers . In that moment of surpassing technological triumph , men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity seeing in that far perspective that man s destiny on earth is not divisible telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos , our destiny lies not in the stars but on Earth itself , in our own hands , in our own hearts . We have endured a long night of the American spirit . But as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn , let us not curse the remaining dark . Let us gather the light . Our destiny offers , not the cup of despair , but the chalice of opportunity . So let us seize it , not in fear , but in gladness and , riders on the earth together , let us go forward , firm in our faith , steadfast in our purpose , cautious of the dangers but sustained by our confidence in the will of God and the promise of man .<speech_sep>Good evening my fellow Americans Before going over to the Shoreham Hotel to address the victory celebration which is in process there , I wanted to take a moment to say a word to all of you in this very personal way , speaking from the Oval Office . I first want to express my deep appreciation to every one of you , the millions of you who gave me your support in the election today , and I want to express my respect for millions of others who gave their support to Senator McGovern . I know that after a campaign , when one loses , he can feel very , very low , and his supporters as well may feel that way . And when he wins , as you will note when I get over to the Shoreham , people are feeling very much better . The important thing in our process , however , is to play the game , and in the great game of life , and particularly the game of politics , what is important is that on either side more Americans voted this year than ever before , and the fact that you won or you lost must not keep you from keeping in the great game of politics in the years ahead , because the better competition we have between the two parties , between the two men running for office , whatever office that may be , means that we get the better people and the better programs for our country . Now that the election is over , it is time to get on with the great tasks that lie before us . I have tried to conduct myself in this campaign in a way that would not divide our country , not divide it regionally or by parties or in any other way , because I very firmly believe that what unites America today is infinitely more important than those things which divide us . We are united Americans North , East , West , and South , both parties in our desire for peace , peace with honor , the kind of a peace that will last , and we are moving swiftly toward that great goal , not just in Vietnam , but a new era of peace in which the old relationships between the two super powers , the Soviet Union and the United States , and between the world s most populous nation , the People s Republic of China , and the United States , are changed so that we are on the eve of what could be the greatest generation of peace , true peace for the whole world , that man has ever known . This is a great goal , bigger than whether we are Democrats or Republicans , and it is one that I think you will want to work with me , with all of us , in helping to achieve . There are other goals that go with that the prosperity without war and without inflation that we have all wanted and that we now can have , and the progress for all Americans , the kind of progress so that we can say to any young American , whatever his background , that he or she in this great country has an equal chance to go to the top in whatever field he or she may choose . I have noted , in listening to the returns a few minutes ago , that several commentators have reflected on the fact that this may be one of the great political victories of all time . In terms of votes that may be true , but in terms of what a victory really is , a huge landslide margin means nothing at all unless it is a victory for America . It will be a victory for America only if , in these next four years , we , all of us , can work together to achieve our common great goals of peace at home and peace for all nations in the world , and for that new progress and prosperity which all Americans deserve . I would only hope that in these next four years we can so conduct ourselves in this country , and so meet our responsibilities in the world in building peace in the world , that years from now people will look back to the generation of the 1970s , at how we have conducted ourselves , and they will say , God bless America . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Good morning , my fellow Americans Over the past ten years , Presidents of the United States have come before the American people in times of crisis to talk about war or the threat of war . Today I am able to talk to you in a more hopeful and positive vein about how we are moving this Nation and the world toward a lasting peace . We have brought ourselves to a time of transition , from war toward peace , and this is a good time to gain some perspective on where we are and where we are headed . Today I am sending to the Congress my second annual comprehensive report on the conduct of our foreign affairs . It discusses not only what we have done but why we have done it , and how we intend to proceed in the future . I do not intend to summarize all that is in my detailed report on foreign policy at this time . Instead , I would like to focus on three key points How we are getting out of the war this Nation has been in for the past six years How we have created a new and different foreign policy approach for the United States in a greatly changed world and How we are applying that approach in working with others to build a lasting peace . The most immediate and anguishing problem that faced this Administration two years ago was the war in Vietnam . We have come a long way since then . Two years ago , when this Administration took office , there were almost 550 , 000 Americans in Vietnam . Within 60 days we will have brought home 260 , 000 men , and this spring I will announce a new schedule of withdrawals . Two years ago , our casualties each month were five times as high as they are today . Two years ago , the additional demands of the Vietnam war cost us approximately 22 billion per year . That cost has been cut in half . Much of the progress in Vietnam was due to the success of the allied operations against the enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia last spring . The clear proof is in this figure American casualties after Cambodia have been half the rate they were before Cambodia . Our decision to clean out the sanctuaries in Cambodia saved thousands of American lives . And it enabled us to continue withdrawing our men on schedule . Just as last year s cutoff of supplies through Cambodia has saved lives and insured our withdrawal program this year , the purpose of this year s disruption of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos is to save lives and insure the success of our withdrawal program next year . The disruption of the Communist supply line through Laos is being accomplished by South Vietnamese troops , with no ground troops or advisers . Their army is doing the fighting , with our air support , and the intensity of the fighting is evidence of the importance of that supply line to the enemy . Consider this combination of events that many people thought was impossible only two years ago We have kept our commitments as we have taken out our troops . South Vietnam now has an excellent opportunity not only to survive but to build a strong , free society . Thanks to the disruption of so much of the enemy s supplies , Americans are leaving South Vietnam in safety we would much prefer to leave South Vietnam in peace . Negotiation remains the best and quickest way to end the war in a way that will not only end involvement and casualties but will mean an end to the fighting between North and South Vietnamese . On October 7 , we made a proposal that could open the door to that kind of peace . We proposed an immediate standstill cease fire throughout Indochina to stop the fighting , an Indochina peace conference , the withdrawal of all outside forces , a political settlement fair to both sides , the immediate release of all prisoners of war . I reaffirm that proposal today . It is supported by every government in Indochina except one the Government of North Vietnam . I once again urge Hanoi to join us in this search for peace . If North Vietnam wishes to negotiate with the United States , they will have to recognize that time is running out . With the exception of the prisoners of war issue , if North Vietnam continues to refuse to discuss our peace proposals , they will soon find they have no choice but to negotiate only with the South Vietnamese . Our eventual goal is a total withdrawal of all outside forces . But as long as North Vietnam continues to hold a single American prisoner , we shall have forces in South Vietnam . The American prisoners of war will not be forgotten by their Government . I am keeping my pledge to end America s involvement in this war . But the main point I want to discuss with you today and the main theme of my report to the Congress is the future , not the past . It matters very much how we end this war . To end a war is simple . But to end a war in a way that will not bring on another war is far from simple . In Southeast Asia today , aggression is failing thanks to the determination of the South Vietnamese people and to the courage and sacrifice of America s fighting men . That brings us to a point that we have been at several times before in this century aggression trained back , a war ending . We are at a critical moment in history What America does or fails to do will determine whether peace and freedom can be won in the coming generation . That is why the way in which we end this conflict is so crucial to our efforts to build a lasting peace in coming decades . The right way out of Vietnam is crucial to our changing role in the world and to peace in the world . To understand the nature of the new American role we must consider the great historical changes that have taken place . For 25 years after World War Ithe United States was not only the leader of the non Communist world , it was the primary supporter and defender of this free world as well . But today our allies and friends have gained new strength and self confidence . They are now able to participate much more fully not only in their own defense but in adding their moral and spiritual strength to the creation of a stable world order . Today our adversaries no longer present a solidly united front we can now differentiate in our dealings with them . Today neither the United States nor the Soviet Union has a clear cut nuclear advantage the time is therefore ripe to come to an agreement on the control of arms . The world has changed . Our foreign policy must change with it . We have learned in recent years the dangers of over involvement . The other danger a grave risk we are equally determined to avoid is under involvement . After a long and unpopular war , there is temptation to turn inward to withdraw from the world , to back away from our commitments . That deceptively smooth road of the new isolationism is surely the road to war . Our foreign policy today steers a steady course between the past danger of over involvement and the new temptation of under involvement . That policy , which I first enunciated in Guam 19 months ago represents our basic approach to the world We will maintain our commitments , but we will make sure our own troop levels or any financial support to other nations is appropriate to current threats and needs . We shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security . But we will look to threatened countries and their neighbors to assume primary responsibility for their own defense , and we will provide support where our interests call for that support and where it can make a difference . These principles are not limited to security matters . We shall pursue economic policies at home and abroad that encourage trade wherever possible and that strengthen political ties between nations . As we actively seek to help other nations expand their economies , we can legitimately expect them to work with us in averting economic problems of our own . As we continue to send economic aid to developing nations , we will expect countries on the receiving end to mobilize their resources we will look to other developed nations to do more in furnishing assistance and we will channel our aid increasingly through groups of nations banded together for mutual support . This new sharing of responsibility requires not less American leadership than in the past , but rather a new , more subtle , form of leadership . No single nation can build a peace alone peace can only be built by the willing hands and minds of all . In the modern world , leadership cannot be do it yourself the path of leadership is in providing the help , the motive , the inspiration to do it together . In carrying out what is referred to as the Nixon Doctrine , we recognize that we cannot transfer burdens too swiftly . We must strike a balance between doing too much and preventing self reliance , and suddenly doing too little and undermining self confidence . We intend to give our friends the time and the means to adjust , materially and psychologically , to a new form of American participation in the world . How have we applied our new foreign policy during the past year And what is our future agenda as we work with others to build a stable world order In Western Europe , we have shifted from predominance to partnership with our allies . Our ties with Western Europe are central to the structure of peace because its nations are rich in tradition and experience , strong economically , vigorous in diplomacy and culture they are in a position to take a major part in building a world of peace . Our ties were strengthened on my second trip to Europe this summer and reflected in our close consultation on arms control negotiations . At our suggestion , the NATO alliance made a thorough review of its military strategy and posture . As a result , we have reached new agreement on a strong defense and the need to share the burden more fairly . In Eastern Europe , our exchange of state visits with Romania and my meeting last fall with Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia are examples of our search for wider reconciliation with the nations that used to be considered behind an Iron Curtain . Looking ahead in Europe We shall cooperate in our political and economic relations across the Atlantic as the Common Market grows . We and our allies will make the improvements necessary to carry out our common defense strategy . Together we stand ready to reduce forces in Western Europe in exchange for mutual reductions in Eastern Europe . The problems of Africa are great , but so is her potential . The United States will support her peoples efforts to build a continent that provides social justice and economic expansion . Turning to our own hemisphere In Latin America , there was too much tendency in the past to take our closest friends and neighbors for granted . Recently , we have paid new respect to their proud traditions . Our trade , credit , and economic policies have been reexamined and reformed to respond to their concerns and their ideas , as well as to our own interests . Our new Latin American policy is designed to help them help themselves our new attitude will not only aid their progress but add to their dignity . Great changes are brewing throughout the American hemisphere . We can have no greater goal than to help provide the means for necessary change to be accomplished in peace and for all change to be in the direction of greater self reliance . Turning to the Far East a new Asia is emerging . The old enmities of World War II are dead or dying . Asian states are stronger and are joining together in vigorous regional groupings . Here the doctrine that took shape last year is taking hold today , helping to spur self reliance and cooperation between states . In Japan , South Korea , Thailand , and the Philippines , we have consolidated bases and reduced American forces . We have relaxed trade and travel restrictions to underline our readiness for greater contact with Communist China . Looking ahead in that area While continuing to help our friends help themselves , we must begin to consider how regional associations can work together with the major powers in the area for a durable peace . We will work to build a strong partnership with Japan that will accommodate our mutual interests . We will search for consecutive discussions with Communist China while maintaining our defense commitment to Taiwan . When the Government of the People s Republic of China is ready to engage in talks , it will find us receptive to agreements that further the legitimate national interests of China and its neighbors . In Asia , we can see tomorrow s world in microcosm . An economically powerful democratic free nation , Japan , is seeking new markets a potentially powerful Communist nation , China , will one day seek new outlets and new relations a Communist competitor , the Soviet Union , has interests there as well and the independent non Communist nations of Southeast Asia are already working together in regional association . These great forces are bound to interact in the not too distant future . In the way they work together and in the way we cooperate with their relationship is the key to permanent peace in that area the Far East , the scene of such a painful legacy of the recent past , can become an example of peace and stability in the future . In the Middle East , the United States took the initiative to stop the fighting and start the process of peace . Along the Suez Canal a year ago , there was daily combat on the ground and in the air . Diplomacy was at an impasse . The danger of local conflict was magnified by growing Soviet involvement and the possibility of great powers being drawn into confrontation . America took the lead in arranging a cease fire and getting negotiations started . We are seeing to it that the balance of power , so necessary to discourage a new outbreak of fighting , is not upset . Working behind the scenes , when a crisis arose in Jordan , the United States played a key role in seeing that order was restored and an invasion was abandoned . We recognize that centuries of suspicion and decades of hostility cannot be ended overnight . There are great obstacles in the way of a permanent , peaceful settlement , and painful compromise is required by all concerned . We are encouraged by the willingness of each of the parties to begin to look to the larger interest of peace and stability throughout the Middle East . There is still the risk of war , but now for the first time in years the parties are actively calculating the risks of peace . The policy of the United States will continue to be to promote peace talks not to try to impose a peace from the outside , but to support the peace efforts of the parties in the region themselves . One way to support these efforts is for the United States to discourage any outside power from trying to exploit the situation for its own advantage . Another way for us to help turn a tenuous truce into a permanent settlement is this The United States is fully prepared to play a responsible and cooperative role in keeping the peace arrived at through negotiation between the parties . We know what our vital interests are in the Middle East . Those interests include friendly and constructive relations with all nations in the area . Other nations know that we are ready to protect those vital interests . And one good reason why other nations take us at our word in the Middle East is because the United States has kept its word in Southeast Asia . We now come to a matter that affects every nation the relations between the world s two great super powers . Over the past years , in some fields the Soviet Union and the United States have moved ahead together . We have taken the first step toward cooperation in outer space . We have both ratified the treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons . Just two weeks ago , we signed a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons from the seabeds . These are hopeful signs , but certain other Soviet actions are reason for concern . There is need for much more cooperation in reducing tensions in the Middle East and in ending harassment of Berlin . We must also discourage the temptation to raise new challenges in sensitive areas such as the Caribbean . In the long run , the most significant result of negotiations between the super powers in the past year could be in the field of arms control . The strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union have produced the most searching examination of the nature of strategic competition ever conducted between our two nations . Each side has had the chance to explain at length the concerns caused by the posture of the other side . The talks have been conducted in a serious way without the old lapses into propaganda . If both sides continue in this way , there is reason to hope that specific agreements will be reached to curb the arms race . Taking a first step in limiting the capacity of mankind to destroy itself would mark a turning point in the history of the postwar world it would add to the security of both the Soviet Union and the United States , and it would add to the world s peace of mind . In all our relations with the Soviets , we shall make the most progress by recognizing that in many cases our national interests are not the same . It serves no purpose to pretend they are our differences are not matters of mood , they are matters of substance . But in many other cases , our separate national interests can best be pursued by a sober consideration of the world interest . The United States will deal , as it must , from strength We will not reduce our defenses below the level I consider essential to our national security . A strong America is essential to the cause of peace today . Until we have the kind of agreements we can rely on , we shall remain strong . But America s power will always be used for building a peace , never for breaking it only for defending freedom , never for destroying it . America s strength will be , as it must be , second to none but the strength that this Nation is proudest of is the strength of our determination to create a peaceful world . We all know how every town or city develops a sense of community when its citizens come together to meet a common need . The common needs of the world today , about which there can be no disagreement or conflict of national interest , are plain to see . We know that we must act as one world in restoring the world s environment , before pollution of the seas and skies overwhelms every nation . We know we must stop the flow of narcotics we must counter the outbreaks of hijacking and kidnaping we must share the great discoveries about the oceans and outer space . The United States is justly proud of the lead it has taken in working within the United Nations , and within the NATO alliance , to come to grips with these problems and with these opportunities . Our work here is a beginning , not only in coping with the new challenges of technology and modern life but of developing a worldwide sense of community that will ease tension , reduce suspicion , and thereby promote the process of peace . That process can only flourish in a climate of mutual respect . We can have that mutual respect with our friends , without dominating them or without letting them down . We can have that mutual respect with our adversaries , without compromising our principles or weakening our resolve . And we can have that mutual respect among ourselves , without stifling dissent or losing our capacity for action . Our goal is something Americans have not enjoyed in this century a full generation of peace . A full generation of peace depends not only on the policy of one party or of one nation or one alliance or one bloc of nations . Peace for the next generation depends on our ability to make certain that each nation has a share in its shaping , and that every nation has a stake in its lasting . This is the hard way , requiring patience , restraint , understanding , and when necessary bold , decisive action . But history has taught us that the old diplomacy of imposing a peace by the fiat of great powers simply does not work . I believe that the new diplomacy of partnership , of mutual respect , of dealing with strength and determination will work . I believe that the right degree of American involvement not too much and not too little will evoke the right response from our other partners on this globe in building for our children the kind of world they deserve a world of opportunity in a world without war .<speech_sep>Good evening This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office , where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this Nation . Each time I have done so to discuss with you some matter that I believe affected the national interest . In all the decisions I have made in my public life , I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation . Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate , I have felt it was my duty to persevere , to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me . In the past few days , however , it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort . As long as there was such a base , I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion , that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future . But with the disappearance of that base , I now believe that the constitutional purpose has been served , and there is no longer a need for the process to be prolonged . I would have preferred to carry through to the finish , whatever the personal agony it would have involved , and my family unanimously urged me to do so . But the interests of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations . From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders , I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter , I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation will require . I have never been a quitter . To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body . But as President , I must put the interests of America first . America needs a full time President and a full time Congress , particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad . To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home . Therefore , I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow . Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office . As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term , I feel a great sadness that I will not be here in this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in the next 2 1 2 years . But in turning over direction of the Government to Vice President Ford , I know , as I told the Nation when I nominated him for that office 10 months ago , that the leadership of America will be in good hands . In passing this office to the Vice President , I also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on his shoulders tomorrow and , therefore , of the understanding , the patience , the cooperation he will need from all Americans . As he assumes that responsibility , he will deserve the help and the support of all of us . As we look to the future , the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of this Nation , to put the bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us and to rediscover those shared ideals that lie at the heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free people . By taking this action , I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America . I regret deeply any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision . I would say only that if some of my judgments were wrong and some were wrong they were made in what I believed at the time to be the best interest of the Nation . To those who have stood with me during these past difficult months to my family , my friends , to many others who joined in supporting my cause because they believed it was right I will be eternally grateful for your support . And to those who have not felt able to give me your support , let me say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me , because all of us , in the final analysis , have been concerned with the good of the country , however our judgments might differ . So , let us all now join together in affirming that common commitment and in helping our new President succeed for the benefit of all Americans . I shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term , but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your President for the past 5 1 2 years . These years have been a momentous time in the history of our Nation and the world . They have been a time of achievement in which we can all be proud , achievements that represent the shared efforts of the Administration , the Congress , and the people . But the challenges ahead are equally great , and they , too , will require the support and the efforts of the Congress and the people working in cooperation with the new Administration . We have ended America s longest war , but in the work of securing a lasting peace in the world , the goals ahead are even more far reaching and more difficult . We must complete a structure of peace so that it will be said of this generation , our generation of Americans , by the people of all nations , not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future wars . We have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood between the United States and the People s Republic of China . We must now ensure that the one quarter of the world s people who live in the People s Republic of China will be and remain not our enemies , but our friends . In the Middle East , 100 million people in the Arab countries , many of whom have considered us their enemy for nearly 20 years , now look on us as their friends . We must continue to build on that friendship so that peace can settle at last over the Middle East and so that the cradle of civilization will not become its grave . Together with the Soviet Union , we have made the crucial breakthroughs that have begun the process of limiting nuclear arms . But we must set as our goal not just limiting but reducing and , finally , destroying these terrible weapons so that they cannot destroy civilization and so that the threat of nuclear war will no longer hang over the world and the people . We have opened the new relation with the Soviet Union . We must continue to develop and expand that new relationship so that the two strongest nations of the world will live together in cooperation , rather than confrontation . Around the world in Asia , in Africa , in Latin America , in the Middle East there are millions of people who live in terrible poverty , even starvation . We must keep as our goal turning away from production for war and expanding production for peace so that people everywhere on this Earth can at last look forward in their children s time , if not in our own time , to having the necessities for a decent life . Here in America , we are fortunate that most of our people have not only the blessings of liberty but also the means to live full and good and , by the world s standards , even abundant lives . We must press on , however , toward a goal , not only of more and better jobs but of full opportunity for every American and of what we are striving so hard right now to achieve , prosperity without inflation . For more than a quarter of a century in public life , I have shared in the turbulent history of this era . I have fought for what I believed in . I have tried , to the best of my ability , to discharge those duties and meet those responsibilities that were entrusted to me . Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed , but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena , whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood , who strives valiantly , who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming , but who does actually strive to do the deed , who knows the great enthusiasms , the great devotions , who spends himself in a worthy cause , who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst , if he fails , at least fails while daring greatly . I pledge to you tonight that as long as I have a breath of life in my body , I shall continue in that spirit . I shall continue to work for the great causes to which I have been dedicated throughout my years as a Congressman , a Senator , Vice President , and President , the cause of peace , not just for America but among all nations prosperity , justice , and opportunity for all of our people . There is one cause above all to which I have been devoted and to which I shall always be devoted for as long as I live . When I first took the oath of office as President 5 1 2 years ago , I made this sacred commitment to consecrate my office , my energies , and all the wisdom I can summon to the cause of peace among nations . I have done my very best in all the days since to be true to that pledge . As a result of these efforts , I am confident that the world is a safer place today , not only for the people of America but for the people of all nations , and that all of our children have a better chance than before of living in peace rather than dying in war . This , more than anything , is what I hoped to achieve when I sought the Presidency . This , more than anything , is what I hope will be my legacy to you , to our country , as I leave the Presidency . To have served in this office is to have felt a very personal sense of kinship with each and every American . In leaving it , I do so with this prayer May God s grace be with you in all the days ahead .<speech_sep>Good evening , my fellow Americans Tonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many people in all parts of the world the war in Vietnam . I believe that one of the reasons for the deep division about Vietnam is that many Americans have lost confidence in what their Government has told them about our policy . The American people cannot and should not be asked to support a policy which involves the overriding issues of war and peace unless they know the truth about that policy . Tonight , therefore , I would like to answer some of the questions that I know are on the minds of many of you listening to me . How and why did America get involved in Vietnam in the first place How has this administration changed the policy of the previous administration What has really happened in the negotiations in Paris and on the battlefront in Vietnam What choices do we have if we are to end the war What are the prospects for peace Now , let me begin by describing the situation I found when I was inaugurated on January 20 . The war had been going on for 4 years . 31 , 000 Americans had been killed in action . The training program for the South Vietnamese was behind schedule . 540 , 000 Americans were in Vietnam with no plans to reduce the number . No progress had been made at the negotiations in Paris and the United States had not put forth a comprehensive peace proposal . The war was causing deep division at home and criticism from many of our friends as well as our enemies abroad . In view of these circumstances there were some who urged that I end the war at once by ordering the immediate withdrawal of all American forces . From a political standpoint this would have been a popular and easy course to follow . After all , we became involved in the war while my predecessor was in office . I could blame the defeat which would be the result of my action on him and come out as the peacemaker . Some put it to me quite bluntly This was the only way to avoid allowing Johnson s war to become Nixon s war . But I had a greater obligation than to think only of the years of my administration and of the next election . I had to think of the effect of my decision on the next generation and on the future of peace and freedom in America and in the world . Let us all understand that the question before us is not whether some Americans are for peace and some Americans are against peace . The question at issue is not whether Johnson s war becomes Nixon s war . The great question is How can we win America s peace Well , let us turn now to the fundamental issue . Why and how did the United States become involved in Vietnam in the first place Fifteen years ago North Vietnam , with the logistical support of Communist China and the Soviet Union , launched a campaign to impose a Communist government on South Vietnam by instigating and supporting a revolution . In response to the request of the Government of South Vietnam , President Eisenhower sent economic aid and military equipment to assist the people of South Vietnam in their efforts to prevent a Communist takeover . Seven years ago , President Kennedy sent 16 , 000 military personnel to Vietnam as combat advisers . Four years ago , President Johnson sent American combat forces to South Vietnam . Now , many believe that President Johnson s decision to send American combat forces to South Vietnam was wrong . And many others I among them have been strongly critical of the way the war has been conducted . But the question facing us today is Now that we are in the war , what is the best way to end it In January I could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam would be a disaster not only for South Vietnam but for the United States and for the cause of peace . For the South Vietnamese , our precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the Communists to repeat the massacres which followed their takeover in the North 15 years before . They then murdered more than 50 , 000 people and hundreds of thousands more died in slave labor camps . We saw a prelude of what would happen in South Vietnam when the Communists entered the city of Hue last year . During their brief rule there , there was a bloody reign of terror in which 3 , 000 civilians were clubbed , shot to death , and buried in mass graves . With the sudden collapse of our support , these atrocities of Hue would become the nightmare of the entire nation and particularly for the million and a half Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam when the Communists took over in the North . For the United States , this first defeat in our Nation s history would result in a collapse of confidence in American leadership , not only in Asia but throughout the world . Three American Presidents have recognized the great stakes involved in Vietnam and understood what had to be done . In 1963 , President Kennedy , with his characteristic eloquence and clarity , said we want to see a stable government there , carrying on a struggle to maintain its national independence . We believe strongly in that . We are not going to withdraw from that effort . In my opinion , for us to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of South Viet Nam , but Southeast Asia . So we are going to stay there . President Eisenhower and President Johnson expressed the same conclusion during their terms of office . For the future of peace , precipitate withdrawal would thus be a disaster of immense magnitude . A nation cannot remain great if it betrays its allies and lets down its friends . Our defeat and humiliation in South Vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the councils of those great powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of world conquest . This would spark violence wherever our commitments help maintain the peace in the Middle East , in Berlin , eventually even in the Western Hemisphere . Ultimately , this would cost more lives . It would not bring peace it would bring more war . For these reasons , I rejected the recommendation that I should end the war by immediately withdrawing all of our forces . I chose instead to change American policy on both the negotiating front and battlefront . In order to end a war fought on many fronts , I initiated a pursuit for peace on many fronts . In a television speech on May 14 , in a speech before the United Nations , and on a number of other occasions I set forth our peace proposals in great detail . We have offered the complete withdrawal of all outside forces within one year . We have proposed a cease fire under international supervision . We have offered free elections under international supervision with the Communists participating in the organization and conduct of the elections as an organized political force . And the Saigon Government has pledged to accept the result of the elections . We have not put forth our proposals on a take it or leave it basis . We have indicated that we are willing to discuss the proposals that have been put forth by the other side . We have declared that anything is negotiable except the fight of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own future . At the Paris peace conference , Ambassador Lodge has demonstrated our flexibility and good faith in 40 public meetings . Hanoi has refused even to discuss our proposals . They demand our unconditional acceptance of their terms , which are that we withdraw all American forces immediately and unconditionally and that we overthrow the Government of South Vietnam as we leave . We have not limited our peace initiatives to public forums and public statements . I recognized , in January , that a long and bitter war like this usually cannot be settled in a public forum . That is why in addition to the public statements and negotiations I have explored every possible private avenue that might lead to a settlement . Tonight I am taking the unprecedented step of disclosing to you some of our other initiatives for peace initiatives we undertook privately and secretly because we thought we thereby might open a door which publicly would be closed . I did not wait for my inauguration to begin my quest for peace . Soon after my election , through an individual who is directly in contact on a personal basis with the leaders of North Vietnam , I made two private offers for a rapid , comprehensive settlement . Hanoi s replies called in effect for our surrender before negotiations . Since the Soviet Union furnishes most of the military equipment for North Vietnam , Secretary of State Rogers , my Assistant for National Security Affairs , Kissinger , Ambassador Lodge , and personally , have met on a number of occasions with representatives of the Soviet Government to enlist their assistance in getting meaningful negotiations started . In addition , we have had extended discussions directed toward that same end with representatives of other governments which have diplomatic relations with North Vietnam . None of these initiatives have to date produced results . In mid July , I became convinced that it was necessary to make a major move to break the deadlock in the Paris talks . I spoke directly in this office , where I am now sitting , with an individual who had known Ho Chi Minh on a personal basis for 25 years . Through him I sent a letter to Ho Chi Minh . I did this outside of the usual diplomatic channels with the hope that with the necessity of making statements for propaganda removed , there might be constructive progress toward bringing the war to an end . Let me read from that letter to you now . Dear President I realize that it is difficult to communicate meaningfully across the gulf of four years of war . But precisely because of this gulf , I wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm in all solemnity my desire to work for a just peace . I deeply believe that the war in Vietnam has gone on too long and delay in bringing it to an end can benefit no one least of all the people of Vietnam . . . . The time has come to move forward at the conference table toward an early resolution of this tragic war . You will find us forthcoming and open minded in a common effort to bring the blessings of peace to the brave people of Vietnam . Let history record that at this critical juncture , both sides turned their face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war . I received Ho Chi Minh s reply on August 30 , 3 days before his death . It simply reiterated the public position North Vietnam had taken at Paris and flatly rejected my initiative . The full text of both letters is being released to the press . In addition to the public meetings that I have referred to , Ambassador Lodge has met with Vietnam s chief negotiator in Paris in 11 private sessions . We have taken other significant initiatives which must remain secret to keep open some channels of communication which may still prove to be productive . But the effect of all the public , private , and secret negotiations which have been undertaken since the bombing halt a year ago and since this administration came into office on January 20 , can be summed up in one sentence No progress whatever has been made except agreement on the shape of the bargaining table . Well now , who is at fault It has become clear that the obstacle in negotiating an end to the war is not the President of the United States . It is not the South Vietnamese Government . The obstacle is the other side s absolute refusal to show the least willingness to join us in seeking a just peace . And it will not do so while it is convinced that all it has to do is to wait for our next concession , and our next concession after that one , until it gets everything it wants . There can now be no longer any question that progress in negotiation depends only on Hanoi s deciding to negotiate , to negotiate seriously . I realize that this report on our efforts on the diplomatic front is discouraging to the American people , but the American people are entitled to know the truth the bad news as well as the good news where the lives of our young men are involved . Now let me turn , however , to a more encouraging report on another front . At the time we launched our search for peace I recognized we might not succeed in bringing an end to the war through negotiation . therefore , put into effect another plan to bring peace a plan which will bring the war to an end regardless of what happens on the negotiating front . It is in line with a major shift in foreign policy which I described in my press conference at Guam on July 25 . Let me briefly explain what has been described as the Nixon Doctrine a policy which not only will help end the war in Vietnam , but which is an essential element of our program to prevent future Vietnams . We Americans are a do it yourself people . We are an impatient people . Instead of teaching someone else to do a job , we like to do it ourselves . And this trait has been carried over into our foreign policy . In Korea and again in Vietnam , the United States furnished most of the money , most of the arms , and most of the men to help the people of those countries defend their freedom against Communist aggression . Before any American troops were committed to Vietnam , a leader of another Asian country expressed this opinion to me when I was traveling in Asia as a private citizen . He said When you are trying to assist another nation defend its freedom , policy should be to help them fight the war but not to fight the war for them . Well , in accordance with this wise counsel , I laid down in Guam three principles as guidelines for future American policy toward Asia First , the United States will keep all of its treaty commitments . Second , we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security . Third , in cases involving other types of aggression , we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments . But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense . After I announced this policy , I found that the leaders of the Philippines , Thailand , Vietnam , South Korea , and other nations which might be threatened by Communist aggression , welcomed this new direction in American foreign policy . The defense of freedom is everybody s business not just America s business . And it is particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom is threatened . In the previous administration , we Americanized the war in Vietnam . In this administration , we are Vietnamizing the search for peace . The policy of the previous administration not only resulted in our assuming the primary responsibility for fighting the war , but even more significantly did not adequately stress the goal of strengthening the South Vietnamese so that they could defend themselves when we left . The Vietnamization plan was launched following Secretary Laird s visit to Vietnam in March . Under the plan , I ordered first a substantial increase in the training and equipment of South Vietnamese forces . In July , on my visit to Vietnam , I changed General Abrams orders so that they were consistent with the objectives of our new policies . Under the new orders , the primary mission of our troops is to enable the South Vietnamese forces to assume the full responsibility for the security of South Vietnam . Our air operations have been reduced by over 20 percent . And now we have begun to see the results of this long overdue change in American policy in Vietnam . After 5 years of Americans going into Vietnam , we are finally bringing American men home . By December 15 , over 60 , 000 men will have been withdrawn from South Vietnam including 20 percent of all of our combat forces . The South Vietnamese have continued to gain in strength . As a result they have been able to take over combat responsibilities from our American troops . Two other significant developments have occurred since this administration took office . Enemy infiltration , infiltration which is essential if they are to launch a major attack , over the last 3 months is less than 20 percent of what it was over the same period last year . Most important United States casualties have declined during the last 2 months to the lowest point in 3 years . Let me now turn to our program for the future . We have adopted a plan which we have worked out in cooperation with the South Vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all combat ground forces , and their replacement by South Vietnamese forces on an orderly scheduled timetable . This withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness . As South Vietnamese forces become stronger , the rate of American withdrawal can become greater . I have not and do not intend to announce the timetable for our program . And there are obvious reasons for this decision which I am sure you will understand . As I have indicated on several occasions , the rate of withdrawal will depend on developments on three fronts . One of these is the progress which can be or might be made in the Paris talks . An announcement of a fixed timetable for our withdrawal would completely remove any incentive for the enemy to negotiate an agreement . They would simply wait until our forces had withdrawn and then move in . The other two factors on which we will base our withdrawal decisions are the level of enemy activity and the progress of the training programs of the South Vietnamese forces . And I am glad to be able to report tonight progress on both of these fronts has been greater than we anticipated when we started the program in June for withdrawal . As a result , our timetable for withdrawal is more optimistic now than when we made our first estimates in June . Now , this clearly demonstrates why it is not wise to be frozen in on a fixed timetable . We must retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on the situation as it is at that time rather than on estimates that are no longer valid . Along with this optimistic estimate , I must in all candor leave one note of caution . If the level of enemy activity significantly increases we might have to adjust our timetable accordingly . However , I want the record to be completely clear on one point . At the time of the bombing halt just a year ago , there was some confusion as to whether there was an understanding on the part of the enemy that if we stopped the bombing of North Vietnam they would stop the shelling of cities in South Vietnam . I want to be sure that there is no misunderstanding on the part of the enemy with regard to our withdrawal program . We have noted the reduced level of infiltration , the reduction of our casualties , and are basing our withdrawal decisions partially on those factors . If the level of infiltration or our casualties increase while we are trying to scale down the fighting , it will be the result of a conscious decision by the enemy . Hanoi could make no greater mistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to its advantage . If I conclude that increased enemy action jeopardizes our remaining forces in Vietnam , I shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation . This is not a threat . This is a statement of policy , which as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces , I am making in meeting my responsibility for the protection of American fighting men wherever they may be . My fellow Americans , I am sure you can recognize from what I have said that we really only have two choices open to us if we want to end this war . I can order an immediate , precipitate withdrawal of all Americans from Vietnam without regard to the effects of that action . Or we can persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiated settlement if possible , or through continued implementation of our plan for Vietnamization if necessary a plan in which we will withdraw all of our forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program , as the South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom . I have chosen this second course . It is not the easy way . It is the right way . It is a plan which will end the war and serve the cause of peace not just in Vietnam but in the Pacific and in the world . In speaking of the consequences of a precipitate withdrawal , I mentioned that our allies would lose confidence in America . Far more dangerous , we would lose confidence in ourselves . Oh , the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that our men were coming home . But as we saw the consequences of what we had done , inevitable remorse and divisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people . We have faced other crises in our history and have become stronger by rejecting the easy way out and taking the right way in meeting our challenges . Our greatness as a nation has been our capacity to do what had to be done when we knew our course was right . I recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan for peace I have chosen . Honest and patriotic Americans have reached different conclusions as to how peace should be achieved . In San Francisco a few weeks ago , I saw demonstrators . carrying signs reading Lose in Vietnam , bring the boys home . Well , one of the strengths of our free society is that any American has a right to reach that conclusion and to advocate that point of view . But as President of the United States , I would be untrue to my oath of office if I allowed the policy of this Nation to be dictated by the minority who hold that point of view and who try to impose it on the Nation by mounting demonstrations in the street . For almost 200 years , the policy of this Nation has been made under our Constitution by those leaders in the Congress and the White House elected by all of the people . If a vocal minority , however fervent its cause , prevails over reason and the will of the majority , this Nation has no future as a free society . And now I would like to address a word , if I may , to the young people of this Nation who are particularly concerned , and I understand why they are concerned , about this war . I respect your idealism . I share your concern for peace . I want peace as much as you do . There are powerful personal reasons I want to end this war . This week I will have to sign 83 letters to mothers , fathers , wives , and loved ones of men who have given their lives for America in Vietnam . It is very little satisfaction to me that this is only one third as many letters as I signed the first week in office . There is nothing I want more than to see the day come when I do not have to write any of those letters . I want to end the war to save the lives of those brave young men in Vietnam . But I want to end it in a way which will increase the chance that their younger brothers and their sons will not have to fight in some future Vietnam someplace in the world . And I want to end the war for another reason . I want to end it so that the energy and dedication of you , our young people , now too often directed into bitter hatred against those responsible for the war , can be turned to the great challenges of peace , a better life for all Americans , a better life for all people on this earth . I have chosen a plan for peace . I believe it will succeed . If it does succeed , what the critics say now will not matter . If it does not succeed , anything I say then will not matter . I know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these days . But I feel it is appropriate to do so on this occasion Two hundred years ago this Nation was weak and poor . But even then , America was the hope of millions in the world . Today we have become the strongest and richest nation in the world . And the Wheel of destiny has turned so that any hope the world has for the survival of peace and freedom will be determined by whether the American people have the moral stamina and the courage to meet the challenge of free world leadership . Let historians not record that when America was the most powerful nation in the world we passed on the other side of the road and allowed the last hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people to be suffocated by the forces of totalitarianism . And so tonight to you , the great silent majority of my fellow Americans I ask for your support . I pledged in my campaign for the Presidency to end the war in a way that we could win the peace . I have initiated a plan of action which will enable me to keep that pledge . The more support I can have from the American people , the sooner that pledge can be redeemed for the more divided we are at home , the less likely the enemy is to negotiate at Paris . Let us be united for peace . Let us also be united against defeat . Because let us understand North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States . Only Americans can do that . Fifty years ago , in this room and at this very desk , President Woodrow Wilson spoke words which caught the imagination of a war weary world . He said This is the war to end war . His dream for peace after World War I was shattered on the hard realities of great power politics and Woodrow Wilson died a broken man . Tonight I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to end wars . But I do say this I have initiated a plan which will end this war in a way that will bring us closer to that great goal to which Woodrow Wilson and every American President in our history has been dedicated the goal of a just and lasting peace . As President I hold the responsibility for choosing the best path to that goal and then leading the Nation along it . I pledge to you tonight that I shall meet this responsibility with all of the strength and wisdom I can command in accordance with your hopes , mindful of your concerns , sustained by your prayers . Thank you and goodnight .<speech_sep>Good evening I want to talk to you tonight from my heart on a subject of deep concern to every American . In recent months , members of my Administration and officials of the Committee for the Re Election of the President including some of my closest friends and most trusted aides have been charged with involvement in what has come to be known as the Watergate affair . These include charges of illegal activity during and preceding the 1972 Presidential election and charges that responsible officials participated in efforts to cover up that illegal activity . The inevitable result of these charges has been to raise serious questions about the integrity of the White House itself . Tonight I wish to address those questions . Last June 17 , while I was in Florida trying to get a few days rest after my visit to Moscow , I first learned from news reports of the Watergate break in . I was appalled at this senseless , illegal action , and I was shocked to learn that employees of the Re Election Committee were apparently among those guilty . I immediately ordered an investigation by appropriate Government authorities . On September 15 , as you will recall , indictments were brought against seven defendants in the case . As the investigations went forward , I repeatedly asked those conducting the investigation whether there was any reason to believe that members of my Administration were in any way involved . I received repeated assurances that there were not . Because of these continuing reassurances , because I believed the reports I was getting , because I had faith in the persons from whom I was getting them , I discounted the stories in the press that appeared to implicate members of my Administration or other officials of the campaign committee . Until March of this year , I remained convinced that the denials were true and that the charges of involvement by members of the White House Staff were false . The comments I made during this period , and the comments made by my Press Secretary in my behalf , were based on the information provided to us at the time we made those comments . However , new information then came to me which persuaded me that there was a real possibility that some of these charges were true , and suggesting further that there had been an effort to conceal the facts both from the public , from you , and from me . As a result , on March 21 , I personally assumed the responsibility for coordinating intensive new inquiries into the matter , and I personally ordered those conducting the investigations to get all the facts and to report them directly to me , right here in this office . I again ordered that all persons in the Government or at the Re Election Committee should cooperate fully with the FBthe prosecutors , and the grand jury . I also ordered that anyone who refused to cooperate in telling the truth would be asked to resign from Government service . And , with ground rules adopted that would preserve the basic constitutional separation of powers between the Congress and the Presidency , I directed that members of the White House Staff should appear and testify voluntarily under oath before the Senate committee which was investigating Watergate . I was determined that we should get to the bottom of the matter , and that the truth should be fully brought out no matter who was involved . At the same time , I was determined not to take precipitate action and to avoid , if at all possible , any action that would appear to reflect on innocent people . I wanted to be fair . But I knew that in the final analysis , the integrity of this office public faith in the integrity of this office would have to take priority over all personal considerations . Today , in one of the most difficult decisions of my Presidency , I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House Bob Haldeman , John Ehrlichman two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know . I want to stress that in accepting these resignations , I mean to leave no implication whatever of personal wrongdoing on their part , and I leave no implication tonight of implication on the part of others who have been charged in this matter . But in matters as sensitive as guarding the integrity of our democratic process , it is essential not only that rigorous legal and ethical standards be observed but also that the public , you , have total confidence that they are both being observed and enforced by those in authority and particularly by the President of the United States . They agreed with me that this move was necessary in order to restore that confidence . Because Attorney General Kleindienst though a distinguished public servant , my personal friend for 20 years , with no personal involvement whatever in this matter has been a close personal and professional associate of some of those who are involved in this case , he and I both felt that it was also necessary to name a new Attorney General . The Counsel to the President , John Dean , has also resigned . As the new Attorney General , I have today named Elliot Richardson , a man of unimpeachable integrity and rigorously high principle . I have directed him to do everything necessary to ensure that the Department of Justice has the confidence and the trust of every law abiding person in this country . I have given him absolute authority to make all decisions bearing upon the prosecution of the Watergate case and related matters . I have instructed him that if he should consider it appropriate , he has the authority to name a special supervising prosecutor for matters arising out of the case . Whatever may appear to have been the case before , whatever improper activities may yet be discovered in connection with this whole sordid affair , I want the American people , I want you to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that during my term as President , justice will be pursued fairly , fully , and impartially , no matter who is involved . This office is a sacred trust and I am determined to be worthy of that trust . Looking back at the history of this case , two questions arise How could it have happened Who is to blame Political commentators have correctly observed that during my 27 years in politics I have always previously insisted on running my own campaigns for office . But 1972 presented a very different situation . In both domestic and foreign policy , 1972 was a year of crucially important decisions , of intense negotiations , of vital new directions , particularly in working toward the goal which has been my overriding concern throughout my political career the goal of bringing peace to America , peace to the world . That is why I decided , as the 1972 campaign approached , that the Presidency should come first and politics second . To the maximum extent possible , therefore , I sought to delegate campaign operations , to remove the day to day campaign decisions from the President s office and from the White House . I also , as you recall , severely limited the number of my own campaign appearances . Who , then , is to blame for what happened in this case For specific criminal actions by specific individuals , those who committed those actions must , of course , bear the liability and pay the penalty . For the fact that alleged improper actions took place within the White House or within my campaign organization , the easiest course would be for me to blame those to whom I delegated the responsibility to run the campaign . But that would be a cowardly thing to do . I will not place the blame on subordinates on people whose zeal exceeded their judgment and who may have done wrong in a cause they deeply believed to be right . In any organization , the man at the top must bear the responsibility . That responsibility , therefore , belongs here , in this office . I accept it . And I pledge to you tonight , from this office , that I will do everything in my power to ensure that the guilty are brought to justice and that such abuses are purged from our political processes in the years to come , long after I have left this office . Some people , quite properly appalled at the abuses that occurred , will say that Watergate demonstrates the bankruptcy of the American political system . I believe precisely the opposite is true . Watergate represented a series of illegal acts and bad judgments by a number of individuals . It was the system that has brought the facts to light and that will bring those guilty to justice a system that in this case has included a determined grand jury , honest prosecutors , a courageous judge , John Sirica , and a vigorous free press . It is essential now that we place our faith in that system and especially in the judicial system . It . is essential that we let the judicial process go forward , respecting those safeguards that are established to protect the innocent as well as to convict the guilty . It is essential that in reacting to the excesses of others , we not fall into excesses ourselves . It is also essential that we not be so distracted by events such as this that we neglect the vital work before us , before this Nation , before America , at a time of critical importance to America and the world . Since March , when I first learned that the Watergate affair might in fact be far more serious than I had been led to believe , it has claimed far too much of my time and my attention . Whatever may now transpire in the case , whatever the actions of the grand jury , whatever the outcome of any eventual trials , I must now turn my full attention and I shall do so once again to the larger duties of this office . I owe it to this great office that I hold , and I owe it to you to my country . I know that as Attorney General , Elliot Richardson will be both fair and he will be fearless in pursuing this case wherever it leads . I am confident that with him in charge , justice will be done . There is vital work to be done toward our goal of a lasting structure of peace in the world work that cannot wait , work that I must do . Tomorrow , for example , Chancellor Brandt of West Germany will visit the White House for talks that are a vital element of The Year of Europe , as 1973 has been called . We are already preparing for the next Soviet American summit meeting later this year . This is also a year in which we are seeking to negotiate a mutual and balanced reduction of armed forces in Europe , which will reduce our defense budget and allow us to have funds for other purposes at home so desperately needed . It is the year when the United States and Soviet negotiators will seek to work out the second and even more important round of our talks on limiting nuclear arms and of reducing the danger of a nuclear war that would destroy civilization as we know it . It is a year in which we confront the difficult tasks of maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and in the potentially explosive Middle East . There is also vital work to be done right here in America to ensure prosperity , and that means a good job for everyone who wants to work to control inflation , that I know worries every housewife , everyone who tries to balance a family budget in America to set in motion new and better ways of ensuring progress toward a better life for all Americans . When I think of this office of what it means I think of all the things that I want to accomplish for this Nation , of all the things I want to accomplish for you . On Christmas Eve , during my terrible personal ordeal of the renewed bombing of North Vietnam , which after 12 years of war finally helped to bring America peace with honor , I sat down just before midnight . I wrote out some of my goals for my second term as President . Let me read them to you . To make it possible for our children , and for our children s children , to live in a world of peace . To make this country be more than ever a land of opportunity of equal opportunity , full opportunity for every American . To provide jobs for all who can work , and generous help for those who cannot work . To establish a climate of decency and civility , in which each person respects the feelings and the dignity and the Godgiven rights of his neighbor . To make this a land in which each person can dare to dream , can live his dreams not in fear , but in hope proud of his community , proud of his country , proud of what America has meant to himself and to the world . These are great goals . I believe we can , we must work for them . We can achieve them . But we cannot achieve these goals unless we dedicate ourselves to another goal . We must maintain the integrity of the White House , and that integrity must be real , not transparent . There can be no whitewash at the White House . We must reform our political process ridding it not only of the violations of the law but also of the ugly mob violence and other inexcusable campaign tactics that have been too often practiced and too readily accepted in the past , including those that may have been a response by one side to the excesses or expected excesses of the other side . Two wrongs do not make a right . I have been in public life for more than a quarter of a century . Like any other calling , politics has good people and bad people . And let me tell you , the great majority in politics in the Congress , in the Federal Government , in the State government are good people . I know that it can be very easy , under the intensive pressures of a campaign , for even well intentioned people to fall into shady tactics to rationalize this on the grounds that what is at stake is of such importance to the Nation that the end justifies the means . And both of our great parties have been guilty of such tactics in the past . . In recent years , however , the campaign excesses that have occurred on all sides have provided a sobering demonstration of how far this false doctrine can take us . The lesson is clear America , in its political campaigns , must not again fall into the trap of letting the end , however great that end is , justify the means . I urge the leaders of both political parties , I urge citizens , all of you , everywhere , to join in working toward a new set of standards , new rules and procedures to ensure that future elections will be as nearly free of such abuses as they possibly can be made . This is my goal . I ask you to join in making it America s goal . When I was inaugurated for a second time this past January 20 , I gave each member of my Cabinet and each member of my senior White House Staff a special 4 year calendar , with each day marked to show the number of days remaining to the Administration . In the inscription on each calendar , I wrote these words The Presidential term which begins today consists of 1 , 461 days no more , no less . Each can be a day of strengthening and renewal for America each can add depth and dimension to the American experience . If we strive together , if we make the most of the challenge and the opportunity that these days offer us , they can stand out as great days for America , and great moments in the history of the world . I looked at my own calendar this morning up at Camp David as I was working on this speech . It showed exactly 1 , 361 days remaining in my term . I want these to be the best days in America s history , because I love America . I deeply believe that America is the hope of the world . And I know that in the quality and wisdom of the leadership America gives lies the only hope for millions of people all over the world that they can live their lives in peace and freedom . We must be worthy of that hope , in every sense of the word . Tonight , I ask for your prayers to help me in everything that I do throughout the days of my Presidency to be worthy of their hopes and of yours . God bless America and God bless each and every one of you .<speech_sep>
