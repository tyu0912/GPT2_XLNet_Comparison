Speaker , President , my colleagues in the Congress , our distinguished guests , my fellow Americans Twenty five years ago I sat here as a freshman Congressman along with Speaker Albert and listened for the first time to the President address the state of the Union . I shall never forget that moment . The Senate , the diplomatic corps , the Supreme Court , the Cabinet entered the chamber , and then the President of the United States . As all of you are aware , I had some differences with President Truman . He had some with me . But I remember that on that day the day he addressed that joint session of the newly elected Republican 80th Congress , he spoke not as a partisan , but as President of all the people calling upon the Congress to put aside partisan considerations in the national interest . The Greek Turkish aid program , the Marshall Plan , the great foreign policy initiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war for over 25 years were approved by the 80th Congress , by a bipartisan majority of which I was proud to be a part . Nineteen hundred seventy two is now before us . It holds precious time in which to accomplish good for the nation . We must not waste it . I know the political pressures in this session of the Congress will be great . There are more candidates for the Presidency in this chamber today than there probably have been at any one time in the whole history of the Republic . And there is an honest difference of opinion , not only between the parties , but within each party , on some foreign policy issues and on some domestic policy issues . However , there are great national problems that are so vital that they transcend partisanship . So let us have our debates . Let us have our honest differences . But let us join in keeping the national interest first . Let us join in making sure that legislation the nation needs does not become hostage to the political interests of any party or any person . There is ample precedent , in this election year , for me to present you with a huge list of new proposals , knowing full well that there would not be any possibility of your passing them if you worked night and day . I shall not do that . I have presented to the leaders of the Congress today a message of 15 , 000 words discussing in some detail where the nation stands and setting forth specific legislative items on which I have asked the Congress to act . Much of this is legislation which I proposed in 1969 , in 1970 , and also in the first session of this 92nd Congress and on which I feel it is essential that action be completed this year . I am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope of passage . I am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacity of this Congress to enact , within the capacity of the budget to finance , and which I believe should be above partisanship programs which deal with urgent priorities for the nation , which should and must be the subject of bipartisan action by this Congress in the interests of the country in 1972 . When I took the oath of office on the steps of this building just three years ago today , the nation was ending one of the most tortured decades in its history . The 1960s were a time of great progress in many areas . But as we all know , they were also times of great agony the agonies of war , of inflation , of rapidly rising crime , of deteriorating titles , of hopes raised and disappointed , and of anger and frustration that led finally to violence and to the worst civil disorder in a century . I recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame . The nation was so torn in those final years of the 60s that many in both parties questioned whether America could be governed at all . The nation has made significant progress in these first years of the 70s Our cities are no longer engulfed by civil disorders . Our colleges and universities have again become places of learning instead of battlegrounds . A beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment . The rate of increase in crime has been slowed and here in the District of Columbia , the one city where the federal government has direct jurisdiction , serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent from the year before . Most important , because of the beginnings that have been made , we can say today that this year 1972 can be the year in which America may make the greatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at peace with all the nations of the world . As our involvement in the war in Vietnam comes to an end , we must now go on to build a generation of peace . To achieve that goal , we must first face realistically the need to maintain our defense . In the past three years , we have reduced the burden of arms . For the first time in 20 years , spending on defense has been brought below spending on human resources . As we look to the future , we find encouraging progress in our negotiations with the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms . And looking further into the future , we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arms . But until there is such a mutual agreement , we must maintain the strength necessary to deter war . And that is why , because of rising research and development costs , because of increases in military and civilian pay , because of the need to proceed with new weapons systems , my budget for the coming fiscal year will provide for an increase in defense spending . Strong military defenses are not the enemy of peace they are the guardians of peace . There could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which would tempt others by weakening America , and thereby endanger the peace of the world . In our foreign policy , we have entered a new era . The world has changed greatly in the 11 years since President John Kennedy said in his Inaugural Address , . . . we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty . Our policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the new realities of the new world we live in . We make today only those commitments we are able and prepared to meet . Our commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable . But others must bear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world . And so this , then , is our policy We will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the United States or of our allies . We will help other nations develop the capability of defending themselves . We will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments . We will act to defend our interests , whenever and wherever they are threatened anyplace in the world . But where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved , our role will be limited . We will not intervene militarily . But we will use our influence to prevent war . If war comes , we will use our influence to stop it . Once it is over , we will do our share in helping to bind up the wounds of those who have participated in it . As you know , I will soon be visiting the People s Republic of China and the Soviet Union . I go there with no illusions . We have great differences with both powers . We shall continue to have great differences . But peace depends on the ability of great powers to live together on the same planet despite their differences . We would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if we failed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we will be able to talk about those differences , rather than to fight about them , in the future . As we look back over this century , let us , in the highest spirit of bipartisanship , recognize that we can be proud of our nation s record in foreign affairs . America has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom , preserving peace , alleviating human suffering around the globe , than any nation has ever done in the history of man . We have fought four wars in this century , but our power has never been used to break the peace , only to keep it never been used to destroy freedom , only to defend it . We now have within our reach the goal of insuring that the next generation can be the first generation in this century to be spared the scourges of war . Turning to our problems at home , we are making progress toward our goal of a new prosperity without war . Industrial production , consumer spending , retail sales , personal income all have been rising . Total employment , real income are the highest in history . New home building starts this past year reached the highest level ever . Business and consumer confidence have both been rising . Interest rates are down . The rate of inflation is down . We can look with confidence to 1972 as the year when the back of inflation will be broken . Now , this a good record , but it is not good enough not when we still have an unemployment rate of 6 percent . It is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetime years of the 60s , or that if the more than two million men released from the armed forces and defense related industries were still in their wartime jobs , unemployment would be far lower . Our goal in this country is full employment in peacetime . We intend to meet that goal , and we can . The Congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our job creating tax program last month . The historic monetary agreements , agreements that we have reached with the major European nations , Canada , and Japan , will help meet it by providing new markets for American products , new jobs for American workers . Our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being inflationary a job producing budget that will help take up the gap as the economy expands to full employment . Our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalize rural America , by giving to America s farmers their fair share of America s increasing productivity . We also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set of major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of America s great capacity for technological advance , and to direct it toward improving the quality of life for every American . In reaching the moon , we demonstrated what miracles American technology is capable of achieving . Now the time has come to move more deliberately toward making full use of that technology here on earth , of harnessing the wonders of science to the service of man . I shall soon send to the Congress a special message proposing a new program of federal partnership in technological research and development with federal incentives to increase private research , federally supported research on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways that will range from improving mass transit to developing new systems of emergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually . Historically , our superior technology , and high productivity have made it possible for American workers to be the highest paid in the world by far , and yet for our goods still to compete in world markets . Now we face a new situation . As other nations move rapidly forward in technology , the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall around America , but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technology still further and by increasing productivity in American industry . Our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for American goods to compete fairly in the world s markets but they still must compete . The new technology program will put to use the skills of many highly trained Americans , skills that might otherwise be wasted . It will also meet the growing technological challenge from abroad , and it will thus help to create new industries , as well as creating more jobs for America s workers in producing for the world s markets . This second session of the 92nd Congress already has before it more than 90 major administration proposals which still await action . I have discussed these in the extensive written message that I have presented to the Congress today . They include , among others , our programs to improve life for the aging to combat crime and drug abuse to improve health services and to ensure that no one will be denied needed health care because of inability to pay to protect workers pension rights to promote equal opportunity for members of minorities , and others who have been left behind to expand consumer protection to improve the environment to revitalize rural America to help the cities to launch new initiatives in education to improve transportation , and to put an end to costly labor tie ups in transportation . The west coast dock strike is a case in point . This nation cannot and will not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie up in the future . The messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our structure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead . They include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare system substitution of a new system that provides work requirements and work incentives for those who can help themselves , income support for those who cannot help themselves , and fairness to the working poor . They include a 17 billion program of federal revenue sharing with the states and localities as an investment in their renewal , an investment also of faith in the American people . They also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of the federal government so that it will be more efficient , more responsive , and able to meet the challenges of the decades ahead . One year ago , standing in this place , I laid before the opening session of this Congress six great goals . One of these was welfare reform . That proposal has been before the Congress now for nearly two and a half years . My proposals on revenue sharing , government reorganization , health care , and the environment have now been before the Congress for nearly a year . Many of the other major proposals that I have referred to have been here that long or longer . Now , 1971 , we can say , was a year of consideration of these measures . Now let us join in making 1972 a year of action on them , action by the Congress , for the nation and for the people of America . Now , in addition , there is one pressing need which I have not previously covered , but which must be placed on the national agenda . We long have looked in this nation to the local property tax as the main source of financing for public primary and secondary education . As a result , soaring school costs , soaring property tax rates now threaten both our communities and our schools . They threaten communities because property taxes , which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1960 to 70 , have become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxes , hitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired and they threaten schools , as hard pressed voters understandably reject new bond issues at the polls . The problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court decisions , which have held that the conventional method of financing schools through local property taxes is discriminatory and unconstitutional . Nearly two years ago , I named a special Presidential commission to study the problems of school finance , and I also directed the federal departments to look into the same problems . We are developing comprehensive proposals to meet these problems . This issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems support of the schools and the basic relationships of federal , state , and local governments in any tax reforms . Under the leadership of the Secretary of the Treasury , we are carefully reviewing all of the tax aspects , and I have this week enlisted the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in addressing the intergovernmental relations aspects . I have asked this bipartisan Commission to review our proposals for federal action to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and property taxes . Later in the year , when both Commissions have completed their studies , I shall make my final recommendations for relieving the burden of property taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing for our children s education . These recommendations will be revolutionary . But all these recommendations , however , will be rooted in one fundamental principle with which there can be no compromise Local school boards must have control over local schools . As we look ahead over the coming decades , vast new growth and change are not only certainties , they will be the dominant reality of this world , and particularly of our life in America . Surveying the certainty of rapid change , we can be like a fallen rider caught in the stirrups we can sit high in the saddle , the masters of change , directing it on a course we choose . The secret of mastering change in today s world is to reach back to old and proven principles , and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to the new realities of a new age . That is what we have done in the proposals that I have laid before the Congress . They are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as human nature , as robust as the American experience and they are responsive to new conditions . Thus they represent a spirit of change that is truly renewal . As we look back at those old principles , we find them as timely as they are timeless . We believe in independence , and self reliance , and the creative value of the competitive spirit . We believe in full and equal opportunity for all Americans and in the protection of individual rights and liberties . We believe in the family as the keystone of the community , and in the community as the keystone of the nation . We believe in compassion toward those in need . We believe in a system of law , justice , and order as the basis of a genuinely free society . We believe that a person should get what he works for and that those who can , should work for what they get . We believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in their own lives , in their own communities and we believe in their right to make those decisions . In applying these principles , we have done so with the full understanding that what we seek in the seventies , what our quest is , is not merely for more , but for better for a better quality of life for all Americans . Thus , for example , we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning up our air and water , making our surroundings more attractive . We are providing broader support for the arts , helping stimulate a deeper appreciation of what they can contribute to the nation s activities and to our individual lives . But nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way we treat one another , than our capacity to live respectfully together as a unified society , with a full , generous regard for the rights of others and also for the feelings of others . As we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years , as we learn once again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another , we are regaining that capacity . As is customary here , on this occasion , I have been talking about programs . Programs are important . But even more important than programs is what we are as a nation what we mean as a nation , to ourselves and to the world . In New York Harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the world the Statue of Liberty , the gift in 1886 of the people of France to the people of the United States . This statue is more than a landmark it is a symbol a symbol of what America has meant to the world . It reminds us that what America has meant is not its wealth , and not its power , but its spirit and purpose a land that enshrines liberty and opportunity , and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in search of a better and a fuller and , above all , a freer life . The world s hopes poured into America , along with its people . And those hopes , those dreams , that have been brought here from every corner of the world , have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world . Four years from now , America will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding as a nation . There are those who say that the old spirit of 76 is dead that we no longer have the strength of character , the idealism , the faith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents . Those who say this do not know America . We have been undergoing self doubts and self criticism . But these are only the other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of want in the midst of plenty , of our impatience with the slowness with which age old ills are being overcome . If we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society , or complacent about our institutions , or blind to the lingering inequities then we would have lost our way . But the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals , deep down , are still strong . Indeed , they remind us that what is really best about America is its compassion . They remind us that in the final analysis , America is great not because it is strong , not because it is rich , but because this is a good country . Let us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we are evil because we are not yet perfect , that we are corrupt because we are not yet pure , that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have gone into the building of America were for naught because the building is not yet done . Let us see that the path we are traveling is wide , with room in it for all of us , and that its direction is toward a better nation and a more peaceful world . Never has it mattered more that we go forward together . Look at this chamber . The leadership of America is here today the Supreme Court , the Cabinet , the Senate , the House of Representatives . Together , we hold the future of the nation , and the conscience of the nation in our hands . Because this year is an election year , it will be a time of great pressure . If we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic challenges that we face , we will have failed the trust of millions of Americans and shaken the confidence they have a right to place in us , in their government . Never has a Congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of a profound and constructive reform for the nation than this Congress . If we succeed in these tasks , there will be credit enough for all not only for doing what is right , but doing it in the right way , by rising above partisan interest to serve the national interest . And if we fail , more than any one of us , America will be the loser . That is why my call upon the Congress today is for a high statesmanship , so that in the years to come Americans will look back and say because it withstood the intense pressures of a political year , and achieved such great good for the American people and for the future of this nation , this was truly a great Congress .<speech_sep>Good evening Tomorrow , 100 million Americans will have an opportunity to participate in a decision that will affect the future of America and the future of the world for generations to come . Regardless of how you vote , I urge each of you to vote . By your vote , you can make sure that this great decision is made by a majority of Americans eligible to vote , and not simply left to the minority who bother to vote . I am not going to insult your intelligence tonight or impose upon your time by rehashing all the issues of the campaign or making any last minute charges against our opponents . You know what the issues are . You know that this is a choice which is probably the clearest choice between the candidates for President ever presented to the American people in this century . I would , however , urge you to have in mind tomorrow one overriding issue , and that is the issue of peace peace in Vietnam and peace in the world at large for a generation to come . As you know , we have made a breakthrough in the negotiations which will lead to peace in Vietnam . We have agreed on the major principles that I laid down in my speech to the Nation of May 8 . We have agreed that there will be a cease fire , we have agreed that our prisoners of war will be returned and that the missing in action will be accounted for , and we have agreed that the people of South Vietnam shall have the right to determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will . There are still some details that I am insisting be worked out and nailed down because I want this not to be a temporary peace . I want , and I know you want , it to be a lasting peace . But I can say to you with complete confidence tonight that we will soon reach agreement on all the issues and bring this long and difficult war to an end . You can help achieve that goal . By your votes , you can send a message to those with whom we are negotiating , and to the leaders of the world , that you back the President of the United States in his insistence that we in the United States seek peace with honor and never peace with surrender . I will not go into the other issues tonight , except to say that as we move to peace , we will open doors to progress on many fronts here at home . It means that we can have something we have not had since President Eisenhower was President 15 years ago prosperity without war and without inflation . It means we can have progress toward better education , better health in all the areas that I have presented to the American people over these past four years . It means that we can move toward a goal that every American wants that is , opportunity for each person in this great and good land to go to the top in whatever particular activity he chooses regardless of his background . Those , then , are the issues you will have in mind . Let me say , finally , I want to thank you for the honor of serving as President for the past four years , and , regardless of your decision tomorrow , I can assure you that I shall continue to work for a goal that every American has Let us make the next four years the best four years in America s history . Thank you . Good evening .<speech_sep>My Fellow Americans I come before you tonight as a candidate for the Vice Presidency and as a man whose honesty and integrity have been questioned . The usual political thing to do when charges are made against you is to either ignore them or to deny them without giving details . I believe we have had enough of that in the United States , particularly with the present Administration in Washington , To me the office of the Vice Presidency of the United States is a great office and I feel that the people have got to have confidence in the integrity of the men who run for that office and who might obtain it . I have a theory , too , that the best and only answer to a smear or to an honest misunderstanding of the facts is to tell the truth . And that is why I am here tonight . I want to tell you my side of the case . I am sure that you have read the charge and you have heard that Senator Nixon , took 18 , 000 from a group of my supporters . Now , was that wrong And let me say that it was wrong I am saying , incidentally , that it was wrong and not just illegal . Because it is not a question of whether it was legal or illegal , that is not enough . The question is , was it morally wrong I say that it was morally wrong if any of that 18 , 000 went to Senator Nixon for my personal use . I say that it was morally wrong if it was secretly given and secretly handled . And I say that it was morally wrong if any of the contributors got special favors for the contributions that they made . And now to answer those questions let me say this Not one cent of the 18 , 000 or any other money of that type ever went to me for my personal use . Every penny of it was used to pay for political expenses that I did not think should be charged to the taxpayers of the United States . It was not a secret fund . As a matter of fact , when I was on Meet the Press , some of you may have seen it last Sunday Peter Edson came up to me after the program and he said , Dick , what about this fund we hear about And I said , Well , there is no secret about it . Go out and see Dana Smith , who was the administrator of the fund . And I gave him his address , and I said that you will find that the purpose of the fund simply was to defray political expenses that I did not feel should be charged to the Government . And third , let me point out , and I want to make this particularly clear , that no contributor to this fund , no contributor to any of my campaign , has ever received any consideration that he would not have received as an ordinary constituent . I just do not believe in that and I can say that never , while I have been in the Senate of the United States , as far as the people that contributed to this fund are concerned , have I made a telephone call for them to an agency , or have I gone down to an agency in their behalf . And the records will show that , the records which are in the hands of the Administration . But then some of you will say and rightly , Well , what did you use the fund for , Senator Why did you have to have it Let me tell you in just a word how a Senate office operates . First of all , a Senator gets 15 , 000 a year in salary . He gets enough money to pay for one trip a year , a round trip that is , for himself and his family between his home and Washington , C . And then he gets an allowance to handle the people that work in his office , to handle his mail . And the allowance for my State of California is enough to hire thirteen people . And let me say , incidentally , that that allowance is not paid to the Senator it is paid directly to the individuals that the Senator puts on his payroll , but all of these people and all of these allowances are for strictly official business . Business , for example , when a constituent writes in and wants you to go down to the Veterans Administration and get some information about his GI policy . Items of that type for example . But there are other expenses which are not covered by the Government . And I think I can best discuss those expenses by asking you some questions . Do you think that when I or any other Senator makes a political speech , has it printed , should charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayers Do you think , for example , when I or any other Senator makes a trip to his home state to make a purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charged to the taxpayers Do you think when a Senator makes political broadcasts or political television broadcasts , radio or television , that the expense of those broadcasts should be charged to the taxpayers Well , I know what your answer is . It is the same answer that audiences give me whenever I discuss this particular problem . The answer is , no . The taxpayers should not be required to finance items which are not official business but which are primarily political business . But then the question arises , you say , Well , how do you pay for l these and how can you do it legally And there are several ways that it can be done , incidentally , and that it is done legally in the United States Senate and in the Congress . The first way is to be a rich man . I do not happen to be a rich man so I could not use that one . Another way that is used is to put your wife on the payroll . Let me say , incidentally , my opponent , my opposite number for the Vice Presidency on the Democratic ticket , does have his wife on the payroll . And has had her on his payroll for the ten years the past ten years . Now just let me say this . That is his business and I am not critical of him for doing that . You will have to pass judgment on that particular point . But I have never done that for this reason . I have found that there are so many deserving stenographers and secretaries in Washington that needed the work that I just did not feel it was right to put my wife on the payroll . My wife s sitting over here . She is a wonderful stenographer . She used to teach stenography and she used to teach shorthand in high school . That was when I met her . And I can tell you folks that she is worked many hours at night and many hours on Saturdays and Sundays in my office and she is done a fine job . And I am proud to say tonight that in the six years I have been in the House and the Senate of the United States , Pat Nixon has never been on the Government payroll . There are other ways that these finances can be taken care of . Some who are lawyers , and I happen to be a lawyer , continue to practice law . But I have not been able to do that . I am so far away from California that I have been so busy with my Senatorial work that I have not engaged in any legal practice . And also as far as law practice is concerned , it seemed to me that the relationship between an attorney and the client was 80 personal that you could not possibly represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when he presented his case to you in the event that he had one before the Government . And so I felt that the best way to handle these necessary political expenses of getting my message to the American people and the speeches I made , the speeches that I had printed , for the most part , concerned this one message of exposing this Administration , the communism in it , the corruption in it the only way that I could do that was to accept the aid which people in my home state of California who contributed to my campaign and who continued to make these contributions after I was elected were glad to make . And let me say I am proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me for a special favor . I am proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me to vote on a bill other than as my own conscience would dictate . And I am proud of the fact that the taxpayers by subterfuge or otherwise have never paid one dime for expenses which I thought were political and should not be charged to the taxpayers . Let me say , incidentally , that some of you may say , Well , that is all right , Senator that is your explanation , but have you got any proof7 And I had like to tell you this evening that just about an hour ago we received an independent audit of this entire fund . I suggested to Gov . Sherman Adams , who is the chief of staff of the Dwight Eisenhower campaign , that an independent audit and legal report be obtained . And I have that audit here in my hand . It is an audit made by the Price , Waterhouse and Co . firm , and the legal opinion by Gibson , Dunn and Crutcher , lawyers in Los Angeles , the biggest law firm and incidentally one of the best ones in Los Angeles . I am proud to be able to report to you tonight that this audit and this legal opinion is being forwarded to General Eisenhower . And I had like to read to you the opinion that was prepared by Gibson , Dunn and Crutcher and based on all the pertinent laws and statutes , together with the audit report prepared by the certified public accountants . It is our conclusion that Senator Nixon did not obtain any financial gain from the collection and disbursement of the fund by Dana Smith that Senator Nixon did not violate any Federal or state law by reason of the operation of the fund , and that neither the portion of the fund paid by Dana Smith directly to third persons nor the portion paid to Senator Nixon to reimburse him for designated office expenses constituted income to the Senator which was either reportable or taxable as income under applicable tax laws . Gibson , Dunn and Crutcher by Alma Conway . Now that , my friends , is not Nixon speaking , but that is an independent audit which was requested because I want the American people to know all the facts and I am not afraid of having independent people go in and check the facts , and that is exactly what they did . But then I realize that there are still some who may say , and rightly so , and let me say that I recognize that some will continue to smear regardless of what the truth may be , but that there has been understandably some honest misunderstanding on this matter , and there is some that will say Well , maybe you were able , Senator , to fake this thing . How can we believe what you say After all , is there a possibility that maybe you got some sums in cash Is there a possibility that you may have feathered your own nest And so now what I am going to do and incidentally this is unprecedented in the history of American politics I am going at this time to give this television and radio audience a complete financial history everything I have earned everything I have spent everything I owe . And I want you to know the facts . I will have to start early . I was born in 1913 . Our family was one of modest circumstances and most of my early life was spent in a store out in East Whittier . It was a grocery store one of those family enterprises . he only reason we were able to make it go was because my mother and dad had five boys and we all worked in the store . I worked my way through college and to a great extent through law school . And then , in 1940 , probably the best thing that ever happened to me happened , I married Pat who is sitting over here . We had a rather difficult time after we were married , like so many of the young couples who may be listening to us . I practiced law she continued to teach school . Then in 1942 I went into the service . Let me say that my service record was not a particularly unusual one . I went to the South Pacific . I guess I am entitled to a couple of battle stars . I got a couple of letters of commendation but I was just there when the bombs were falling and then I returned . I returned to the United States and in 1946 I ran for the Congress . When we came out of the war , Pat and I Pat during the war ad worked as a stenographer and in a bank and as an economist for Government agency and when we came out the total of our saving from both my law practice , her teaching and all the time that I as in the war the total for that entire period was just a little less than 10 , 000 . Every cent of that , incidentally , was in Government bonds . Well , that is where we start when I go into politics . Now what I have I earned since I went into politics Well , here it is I jotted it down , let me read the notes . First of all I have had my salary as a Congressman and as a Senator . Second , I have received a total in this past six years of 1600 from estates which were in my law firm the time that I severed my connection with it . And , incidentally , as I said before , I have not engaged in any legal practice and have not accepted any fees from business that came to the firm after I went into politics . I have made an average of approximately 1500 a year from nonpolitical speaking engagements and lectures . And then , fortunately , we have inherited a little money . Pat sold her interest in her father s estate for 3 , 000 and I inherited l500 from my grandfather . We live rather modestly . For four years we lived in an apartment in Park Fairfax , in Alexandria , Va . The rent was 80 a month . And we saved for the time that we could buy a house . Now , that was what we took in . What did we do with this money What do we have today to show for it This will surprise you , Because it is so little , I suppose , as standards generally go , of people in public life . First of all , we have got a house in Washington which cost 41 , 000 and on which we owe 20 , 000 . We have a house in Whittier , California , which cost 13 , 000 and on which we owe 3000 . My folks are living there at the present time . I have just 4 , 000 in life insurance , plus my policy which I have never been able to convert and which will run out in two years . I have no insurance whatever on Pat . I have no life insurance on our our youngsters , Patricia and Julie . I own a 1950 Oldsmobile car . We have our furniture . We have no stocks and bonds of any type . We have no interest of any kind , direct or indirect , in any business . Now , that is what we have . What do we owe Well , in addition to the mortgage , the 20 , 000 mortgage on the house in Washington , the 10 , 000 one on the house in Whittier , I owe 4 , 500 to the Riggs Bank in Washington , with interest 4 1 2 per cent . I owe 3 , 500 to my parents and the interest on that loan which I pay regularly , because it is the part of the savings they made through the years they were working so hard , I pay regularly 4 per cent interest . And then I have a 500 loan which I have on my life insurance . Well , that is about it . That is what we have and that is what we owe . It is not very much but Pat and I have the satisfaction that every dime that we have got is honestly ours . I should say this that Pat does not have a mink coat . But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat . And I always tell her that she had look good in anything . One other thing I probably should tell you because if we do not they will probably be saying this about me too , we did get something a gift after the election . A man down in Texas heard Pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngsters would like to have a dog . And , believe it or not , the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a message from Union Station in Baltimore saying they had a package for us . We went down to get it . You know what it was . It was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he had sent all the way from Texas . Black and white spotted . And our little girl Tricia , the 6 year old named it Checkers . And you know , the kids , like all kids , love the dog and I just want to say this right now , that regardless of what they say about it , we are gonna keep it . It is not easy to come before a nation wide audience and air your life as I have done . But I want to say some things before I conclude that I think most of you will agree on . Mitchell , the chairman of the Democratic National Committee , made the statement that if a man could not afford to be in the United States Senate he should not run for the Senate . And I just want to make my position clear . I do not agree with Mitchell when he says that only a rich man should serve his Government in the United States Senate or in the Congress . I do not believe that represents the thinking of the Democratic Party , and I know that it does not represent the thinking of the Republican Party . I believe that it is fine that a man like Governor Stevenson who inherited a fortune from his father can run for President . But I also feel that it is essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can also run for President . Because , you know , remember Abraham Lincoln , you remember what he said God must have loved the common people he made so many of them . And now I am going to suggest some courses of conduct . First of all , you have read in the papers about other funds now . Stevenson , apparently , had a couple . One of them in which a group of business people paid and helped to supplement the salaries of state employees . Here is where the money went directly into their pockets . And I think that what Stevenson should do is come before the American people as I have , give the names of the people that have contributed to that fund give the names of the people who put this money into their pockets at the same time that they were receiving money from their state government , and see what favors , if any , they ave out for that . I do not condemn Stevenson for what he did . But until the facts are in there is a doubt that will be raised . And as far as Sparkman is concerned , I would suggest the same thing . He is had his wife on the payroll . I do not condemn him for that . But I think that he should come before the American people and indicate what outside sources of income he has had . I would suggest that under the circumstances both parkman and Stevenson should come before the American people as I have and make a complete financial statement as to their financial history . And if they do not , it will be an admission that they have something to hide . And I think that you will agree with me . Because , folks , remember , a man that is to be President of the United States , a man that is to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people . And that is why I am doing what I am doing , and that is why I suggest that Stevenson and Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing . Now , let me say this I know that this is not the last of the smears . In spite of my explanation tonight other smears will be made others have been made in the past . And the purpose of the mears , I know , is this to silence me , to make me let up . Well , they just do not know who they are dealing with . I am going l tell you this I remember in the dark days of the Hiss case some of the same columnists , some of the same radio commentators who are attacking me now and misrepresenting my position were violently opposing me at the time I was after Alger Hiss . But I continued the fight because I knew I was right . And I an say to this great television and radio audience that I have no pologies to the American people for my part in putting Alger Hiss vhere he is today . And as far as this is concerned , I intend to continue the fight . Why do I feel so deeply Why do I feel that in spite of the mears , the misunderstandings , the necessity for a man to come up here and bare his soul as I have Why is it necessary for me to continue this fight And I want to tell you why . Because , you see , I love my country . And I think my country is in danger . And I think that the only man that can save America at this time is the man that is runing for President on my ticket Dwight Eisenhower . You say , Why do I think it is in danger and I say look at the record . Seven years of the Truman Acheson Administration and that is happened Six hundred million people lost to the Communists , and a war in Korea in which we have lost 117 , 000 American casualties . And I say to all of you that a policy that results in a loss of six hundred million people to the Communists and a war which costs us 117 , 000 American casualties is not good enough for America . And I say that those in the State Department that made the mistakes which caused that war and which resulted in those losses should be kicked out of the State Department just as fast as we can get em out of there . And let me say that I know Stevenson will not do that . Because he defends the Truman policy and I know that Dwight Eisenhower will do that , and that he will give America the leadership that it needs . Take the problem of corruption . You have read about the mess in Washington . Stevenson cannot clean it up because he was picked by the man , Truman , under whose Administration the mess was made . You would not trust a man who made the mess to clean it up that is Truman . And by the same token you cannot trust the man who was picked by the man that made the mess to clean it up and that is Stevenson . And so I say , Eisenhower , who owes nothing to Truman , nothing to the big city bosses , he is the man that can clean up the mess in Washington . Take Communism . I say that as far as that subject is concerned , the danger is great to America . In the Hiss case they got the secrets which enabled them to break the American secret State Department code . They got secrets in the atomic bomb case which enabled them to get the secret of the atomic bomb , five years before they would have gotten it by their own devices . And I say that any man who called the Alger Hiss case a red herring is not fit to be President of the United States . I say that a man who like Stevenson has pooh poohed and ridiculed the Communist threat in the United States he said that they are phantoms among ourselves he is accused us that have attempted to expose the Communists of looking for Communists in the Bureau of Fisheries and Wildlife I say that a man who says that is not qualified to be President of the United States . And I say that the only man who can lead us in this fight to rid the Government of both those who are Communists and those who have corrupted this Government is Eisenhower , because Eisenhower , you can be sure , recognizes the problem and he knows how to deal with it . Now let me say that , finally , this evening I want to read to you just briefly excerpts from a letter which I received , a letter which , after all this is over , no one can take away from us . It reads as follows Dear Senator Nixon Since I am only 19 years of age I cannot vote in this Presidential election but believe me if I could you and General Eisenhower would certainly get my vote . My husband is in the Fleet Marines in Korea . He is a corpsman on the front lines and we have a two month old son he is never seen . And I feel confident that with great Americans like you and General Eisenhower in the White House , lonely Americans like myself will be united with their loved ones now in Korea . I only pray to God that you will not be too late . Enclosed is a small check to help you in your campaign . Living on 85 a month it is all I can afford at present . But let me know what else I can do . Folks , it is a check for 10 , and it is one that I will never cash . And just let me say this . We hear a lot about prosperity these days but I say , why cannot we have prosperity built on peace rather than prosperity built on war Why cannot we have prosperity and an honest government in Washington , C . , at the same time . Believe me , we can . And Eisenhower is the man that can lead this crusade to bring us that kind of prosperity . And , now , finally , I know that you wonder whether or not I am going to stay on the Republican ticket or resign . Let me say this I do not believe that I ought to quit because I am not a quitter . And , incidentally , Pat s not a quitter . After all , her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on Patrick s Day , and you know the Irish never quit . But the decision , my friends , is not mine . I would do nothing that would harm the possibilities of Dwight Eisenhower to become President of the United States . And for that reason I am submitting to the Republican National Committee tonight through this television broadcast the decision which it is theirs to make . Let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt . And I am going to ask you to help them decide . Wire and write the Republican National Committee whether you think I should stay on or whether I should get off . And whatever their decision is , I will abide by it . But just let me say this last word . Regardless of what happens I am going to continue this fight . I am going to campaign up and down America until we drive the crooks and the Communists and those that defend them out of Washington . And remember , folks , Eisenhower is a great man . Believe me . He is a great man . And a vote for Eisenhower is a vote for what is good for America .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , my colleagues in the Congress , our distinguished guests , my fellow Americans As this 92nd Congress begins its session , America has lost a great Senator , and all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a loyal friend . I had the privilege of visiting Senator Russell in the hospital just a few days before he died . He never spoke about himself . He only spoke eloquently about the need for a strong national defense . In tribute to one of the most magnificent Americans of all time , I respectfully ask that all those here will rise in silent prayer for Senator Russell . Thank you . Speaker , before I begin my formal address , I want to use this opportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the rather spirited contest for leadership positions in the House and the Senate and , also , to express my condolences to the losers . I know how both of you feel . And I particularly want to join with all of the members of the House and the Senate as well in congratulating the new Speaker of the United States Congress . To those new members of this House who may have some doubts about the possibilities for advancement in the years ahead , I would remind you that the Speaker and I met just 24 years ago in this chamber as freshmen members of the 80th Congress . As you see , we both have come up in the world a bit since then . Speaker , this 92nd Congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatest Congress in America s history . In these troubled years just past , America has been going through a long nightmare of war and division , of crime and inflation . Even more deeply , we have gone through a long , dark night of the American spirit . But now that night is ending . Now we must let our spirits soar again . Now we are ready for the lift of a driving dream . The people of this nation are eager to get on with the quest for new greatness . They see challenges , and they are prepared to meet those challenges . It is for us here to open the doors that will set free again the real greatness of this nation the genius of the American people . How shall we meet this challenge How can we truly open the doors , and set free the full genius of our people The way in which the 92nd Congress answers these questions will determine its place in history . More importantly , it can determine this nation s place in history as we enter the third century of our independence . Tonight I shall present to the Congress six great goals . I shall ask not simply for more new programs in the old framework . I shall ask to change the framework of government itself to reform the entire structure of American government so we can make it again fully responsive to the needs and the wishes of the American people . If we act boldly if we seize this moment and achieve these goals we can close the gap between promise and performance in American government . We can bring together the resources of this nation and the spirit of the American people . In discussing these great goals , I shall deal tonight only with matters on the domestic side of the nation s agenda . I shall make a separate report to the Congress and the nation next month on developments in foreign policy . The first of these great goals is already before the Congress . I urge that the unfinished business of the 91st Congress be made the first priority business of the 92nd Congress . Over the next two weeks , I will call upon Congress to take action on more than 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completed last year . The most important is welfare reform . The present welfare system has become a monstrous , consuming outrage an outrage against the community , against the taxpayer , and particularly against the children it is supposed to help . We may honestly disagree , as we do , on what to do about it . But we can all agree that we must meet the challenge , not by pouring more money into a bad program , but by abolishing the present welfare system and adopting a new one . So let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in America and without those demeaning , soul stifling affronts to human dignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today . But let us also establish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement . Let us provide the means by which more can help themselves . This shall be our goal . Let us generously help those who are not able to help themselves . But let us stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to do so . The second great goal is to achieve what Americans have not enjoyed since 1957 full prosperity in peacetime . The tide of inflation has turned . The rise in the cost of living , which had been gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties , was reduced last year . Inflation will be further reduced this year . But as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price stability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy , we have paid a price in increased unemployment . We should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in any peacetime year of the sixties . This is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the 70s . We must do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better . To achieve this , I will submit an expansionary budget this year one that will help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunities for millions of Americans . It will be a full employment budget , a budget designed to be in balance if the economy were operating at its peak potential . By spending as if we were at full employment , we will help to bring about full employment . I ask the Congress to accept these expansionary policies to accept the concept of a full employment budget . At the same time , I ask the Congress to cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the limits of the full employment budget . For as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely shared prosperity , we must not reignite the fires of inflation and so undermine that prosperity . With the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget , with the commitment of the independent Federal Reserve System to provide fully for the monetary needs of a growing economy , and with a much greater effort on the part of labor and management to make their wage and price decisions in the light of the national interest and their own self interest then for the worker , the farmer , the consumer , for Americans everywhere we shall gain the goal of a new prosperity more jobs , more income , more profits , without inflation and without war . This is a great goal , and one that we can achieve together . The third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun last year to restore and enhance our natural environment . Building on the foundation laid in the 37 point program that I submitted to Congress last year , I will propose a strong new set of initiatives to clean up our air and water , to combat noise , and to preserve and restore our surroundings . I will propose programs to make better use of our land , to encourage a balanced national growth growth that will revitalize our rural heartland and enhance the quality of life in America . And not only to meet today s needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow , I will put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a President of the United States to expand the nation s parks , recreation areas , open spaces , in a way that truly brings parks to the people where the people are . For only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next generation have parks to enjoy . As a fourth great goal , I will offer a far reaching set of proposals for improving America s health care and making it available more fairly to more people . I will propose A program to insure that no American family will be prevented from obtaining basic medical care by inability to pay . I will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical schools , to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health personnel . Incentives to improve the delivery of health services , to get more medical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately served , to make greater use of medical assistants , and to slow the alarming rise in the costs of medical care . New programs to encourage better preventive medicine , by attacking the causes of disease and injury , and by providing incentives to doctors to keep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick . I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra 100 million to launch an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer , and I will ask later for whatever additional funds can effectively be used . The time has come in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease . Let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal . America has long been the wealthiest nation in the world . Now it is time we became the healthiest nation in the world . The fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our state and local governments . As we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976 , we remember that this nation launched itself as a loose confederation of separate states , without a workable central government . At that time , the mark of its leaders vision was that they quickly saw the need to balance the separate powers of the states with a government of central powers . And so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers , of unity with diversity and so clear was their vision that it survives today as the oldest written constitution still in force in the world . For almost two centuries since and dramatically in the 1930s at those great turning points when the question has been between the states and the federal government , that question has been resolved in favor of a stronger central federal government . During this time the nation grew and the nation prospered . But one thing history tells us is that no great movement goes in the same direction forever . Nations change , they adapt , or they slowly die . The time has now come in America to reverse the flow of power and resources from the states and communities to Washington , and start power and resources flowing back from Washington to the states and communities and , more important , to the people all across America . The time has come for a new partnership between the federal government and the states and localities a partnership in which we entrust the states and localities with a larger share of the nation s responsibilities , and in which we share our federal revenues with them so that they can meet those responsibilities . To achieve this goal , I propose to the Congress tonight that we enact a plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept . All across America today , states and cities are confronted with a financial crisis . Some have already been cutting back on essential services for example , just recently San Diego and Cleveland cut back on trash collections . Most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the one hand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other . As one indication of the rising costs of local government , I discovered the other day that my home town of Whittier , California which has a population of 67 , 000 has a larger budget for 1971 than the entire federal budget was in 1791 . Now the time has come to take a new direction , and once again to introduce a new and more creative balance to our approach to government . So let us put the money where the needs are . And let us put the power to spend it where the people are . I propose that the Congress make a 16 billion investment in renewing state and local government . Five billion dollars of this will be in new and unrestricted funds to be used as the states and localities see fit . The other 11 billion will be provided by allocating 1 billion of new funds and converting one third of the money going to the present narrow purpose aid programs into federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposes for urban development , rural development , education , transportation , job training , and law enforcement but with the states and localites making their own decisions on how it should be spent within each category . For the next fiscal year , this would increase total federal aid to the states and localities more than 25 percent over the present level . The revenue sharing proposals I send to the Congress will include the safeguards against discrimination that accompany all other federal funds allocated to the states . Neither the President nor the Congress nor the conscience of this nation can permit money which comes from all the people to be used in a way which discriminates against some of the people . The federal government will still have a large and vital role to play in achieving our national progress . Established functions that are clearly and essentially federal in nature will still be performed by the federal government . New functions that need to be sponsored or performed by the federal government such as those I have urged tonight in welfare and health will be added to the federal agenda . Whenever it makes the best sense for us to act as a whole nation , the federal government should and will lead the way . But where states or local governments can better do what needs to be done , let us see that they have the resources to do it there . Under this plan , the federal government will provide the states and localities with more money and less interference and by cutting down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot further . Let us share our resources . Let us share them to rescue the states and localities from the brink of financial crisis . Let us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escape from ever higher property taxes and sales taxes . Let us share our resources for two other reasons as well . The first of these reasons has to do with government itself , and the second has to do with each of us , with the individual . Let us face it . Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at all levels . They will not and they should not continue to tolerate the gap between promise and performance in government . The fact is that we have made the federal government so strong it grows muscle bound and the states and localities so weak they approach impotence . If we put more power in more places , we can make government more creative in more places . That way we multiply the number of people with the ability to make things happen and we can open the way to a new burst of creative energy throughout America . The final reason I urge this historic shift is much more personal , for each and for every one of us . As everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in America , as the forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and more impersonal , a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land . Whether it is the workingman who feels neglected , the black man who feels oppressed , or the mother concerned about her children , there has been a growing feeling that Things are in the saddle , and ride mankind . Millions of frustrated young Americans today are crying out asking not what will government do for me , but what can I do , how can I contribute , how can I matter And so let us answer them . Let us say to them and let us say to all Americans , We hear you . We will give you a chance . We are going to give you a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect your future a chance to participate in government because we are going to provide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference that you can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole community . The further away government is from people , the stronger government becomes and the weaker people become . And a nation with a strong government and a weak people is an empty shell . I reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington , C . , is inevitably more wise , more honest , and more efficient than government at the local or state level . The honesty and efficiency of government depends on people . Government at all levels has good people and bad people . And the way to get more good people into government is to give them more opportunity to do good things . The idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows best what is best for people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is really a contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves . This notion is completely foreign to the American experience . Local government is the government closest to the people , it is most responsive to the individual person . It is people s government in a far more intimate way than the government in Washington can ever be . People came to America because they wanted to determine their own future rather than to live in a country where others determined their future for them . What this change means is that once again in America we are placing our trust in people . I have faith in people . I trust the judgment of people . Let us give the people of America a chance , a bigger voice in deciding for themselves those questions that so greatly affect their lives . The sixth great goal is a complete reform of the Federal Government itself . Based on a long and intensive study with the aid of the best advice obtainable , I have concluded that a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch is needed if the government is to keep up with the times and with the needs of the people . I propose , therefore , that we reduce the present 12 Cabinet departments to eight . I propose that the Departments of State , Treasury , Defense , and Justice remain , but that all the other departments be consolidated into four Human Resources , Community Development , Natural Resources , and Economic Development . Let us look at what these would be First , a department dealing with the concerns of people as individuals , as members of a family a department focused on human needs . Second , a department concerned with the community rural communities and urban communities and with all that it takes to make a community function as a community . Third , a department concerned with our physical environment , with the preservation and balanced use of those great natural resources on which our nation depends . And fourth , a department concerned with our prosperity with our jobs , our businesses , and those many activities that keep our economy running smoothly and well . Under this plan , rather than dividing up our departments by narrow subjects , we would organize them around the great purposes of government . Rather than scattering responsibility by adding new levels of bureaucracy , we would focus and concentrate the responsibility for getting problems solved . With these four departments , when we have a problem we will know where to go and the department will have the authority and the resources to do something about it . Over the years we have added departments and created agencies at the federal level , each to serve a new constituency , to handle a particular task and these have grown and multiplied in what has become a hopeless confusion of form and function . The time has come to match our structure to our purposes to look with a fresh eye , to organize the government by conscious , comprehensive design to meet the new needs of a new era . One hundred years ago , Abraham Lincoln stood on a battlefield and spoke of a government of the people , by the people , for the people . Too often since then , we have become a nation of the government , by the government , for the government . By enacting these reforms , we can renew that principle that Lincoln stated so simply and so well . By giving everyone s voice a chance to be heard , we will have government that truly is of the people . By creating more centers of meaningful power , more places where decisions that really count can be made , by giving more people a chance to do something , we can have government that truly is by the people . And by setting up a completely modern , functional system of government at the national level , we in Washington will at last be able to provide government that is truly for the people . I realize that what I am asking is that not only the executive branch in Washington but that even this Congress will have to change by giving up some of its power . Change is hard . But without change there can be no progress . And for each of us the question then becomes , not Will change cause me inconvenience but Will change bring progress for America Giving up power is hard . But I would urge all of you , as leaders of this country , to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history are those who gave power to people , and not those who took it away . As we consider these reforms we will be acting , not for the next two years or for the next ten years , but for the next 100 years . So let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of this moment in history but also of history itself . Let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the boldness and the courage of those great Americans who met in Philadelphia almost 190 years ago to write a constitution . Let us leave a heritage as they did not just for our children but for millions yet unborn of a nation where every American will have a chance not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to participate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes but his ideas count a system of government which will provide the means for America to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before . Those men who met at Philadelphia left a great heritage because they had a vision not only of what the nation was but of what it could become . As I think of that vision , I recall that America was founded as the land of the open door as a haven for the oppressed , a land of opportunity , a place of refuge , of hope . When the first settlers opened the door of America three and a half centuries ago , they came to escape persecution and to find opportunity and they left wide the door of welcome for others to follow . When the 13 Colonies declared their independence almost two centuries ago , they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of human fulfillment not just for an elite but for all . To the generations that followed , America s was the open door that beckoned millions from the old world to the new in search of a better life , a freer life , a fuller life , and in which , by their own decisions , they could shape their own destinies . For the black American , the Indian , the Mexican American , and for those others in our land who have not had an equal chance , the nation at last has begun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal opportunity , and of human dignity . For all Americans , with these changes I have proposed tonight we can open the door to a new era of opportunity . We can open the door to full and effective participation in the decisions that affect their lives . We can open the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels , between those governments and the people themselves . And by so doing , we can open wide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in America now and in the years to come . In the next few weeks I will spell out in greater detail the way I propose that we achieve these six great goals . I ask this Congress to be responsive . If it is , then the 92nd Congress , your Congress , our Congress , at the end of its term , will be able to look back on a record more splendid than any in our history . This can be the Congress that helped us end the longest war in the nation s history , and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance to enjoy what we have not had in this century a full generation of peace . This can be the Congress that helped achieve an expanding economy , with full employment and without inflation and without the deadly stimulus of war . This can be the Congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbed recipients of their dignity and robbed states and cities of their resources . This can be the Congress that pressed forward the rescue of our environment , and established for the next generation an enduring legacy of parks for the people . This can be the Congress that launched a new era in American medicine , in which the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were made less burdensome . But above all , what this Congress can be remembered for is opening the way to a new American revolution a peaceful revolution in which power was turned back to the people in which government at all levels was refreshed and renewed and made truly responsive . This can be a revolution as profound , as far reaching , as exciting as that first revolution almost 200 years ago and it can mean that just five years from now America will enter its third century as a young nation new in spirit , with all the vigor and the freshness with which it began its first century . My colleagues in the Congress , these are great goals . They can make the sessions of this Congress a great moment for America . So let us pledge together to go forward together by achieving these goals to give America the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the years to come , and in so doing to make this the greatest Congress in the history of this great and good country .<speech_sep>Good evening , my fellow Americans . Over the past several weeks you have heard a number of reports on Tradio , and in your newspapers on the situation in Southeast Asia . I think the time has come for me as President and as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces to put these reports in perspective , to lay all the pertinent facts before you and to let you judge for yourselves as to the success or failure of our policy . I am glad to be able to begin my report tonight by announcing that I have decided to increase the rate of American troop withdrawals for the period from May 1 to December 1 . Before going into details , I would like to review briefly what I found when I came into office , the progress we have made to date in reducing American forces , and the reason why I am able to announce a stepped up withdrawal without jeopardizing our remaining forces in Vietnam and without endangering our ultimate goal of ending American involvement in a way which will increase the chances for a lasting peace in the Pacific and in the world . When I left Washington in January of 1961 , after serving eight years as Vice President under President Eisenhower , there were no American combat forces in Vietnam . No Americans had died in combat in Vietnam . When I returned to Washington as President eight years later , there were 540 , 000 American troops in Vietnam . Thirty one thousand had died there . Three hundred Americans were being lost every week and there was no comprehensive plan to end the United States involvement in the war . I implemented a plan to train and equip the South Vietnamese , to withdraw American forces , and to end American involvement in the war just as soon as the South Vietnamese had developed the capacity to defend their country against Communist aggression . On this chart on my right , you can see how our plan has succeeded . In June of 1969 , I announced a withdrawal of 25 , 000 men in September , 40 , 000 December , 50 , 000 April of 1970 , 150 , 000 . By the first of next month , May 1 , we will have brought home more than 265 , 000 Americans almost half of the troops in Vietnam when I took office . Now another indication of the progress we have made is in reducing American casualties . Casualties were five times as great in the first 3 months of 1969 as they were in the first three months this year , 1971 . South Vietnamese casualties have also dropped significantly in the past two years . One American dying in combat is one too many . But our goal is no American fighting man dying anyplace in the world . Every , decision I have made in the past and every decision I make in the future will have the purpose of achieving that goal . Let me review now two decisions I have made which have contributed to the achievements of our goals in Vietnam that you have seen on this chart . The first was the destruction of enemy bases in Cambodia . You will recall that at the time of that decision , many expressed fears that we had widened the war , that our casualties would increase , that our troop withdrawal program would be delayed . Now I do not question the sincerity of those who expressed these fears . But we can see now they were wrong . American troops were out of Cambodia in 60 days , just as I pledged they would be . American casualties did not rise they were cut in half . American troop withdrawals were not halted or delayed they continued at an accelerated pace . Now let me turn to the Laotian operation . As you know , this was undertaken by South Vietnamese ground forces with American air support against North Vietnamese troops which had been using Laotian territory for six years to attack American forces and allied forces in South Vietnam . Since the completion of that operation , there has been a great deal of understandable speculation just as there was after Cambodia whether or not it was a success or a failure , a victory or a defeat . But , as in Cambodia , what is important is not the instant analysis of the moment , but what happens in the future . Did the Laotian operation contribute to the goals we sought I have just completed my assessment of that operation and here are my conclusions First , the South Vietnamese demonstrated that without American advisers they could fight effectively against the very best troops North Vietnam could put in the field . Second , the South Vietnamese suffered heavy casualties , but by every conservative estimate the casualties suffered by the enemy were far heavier . Third , and most important , the disruption of enemy supply lines , the consumption of ammunition and arms in the battle has been even more damaging to the capability of the North Vietnamese to sustain major offensives in South Vietnam than were the operations in Cambodia 10 months ago . Consequently , tonight I can report that Vietnamization has succeeded . Because of the increased strength of the South Vietnamese , because of the success of the Cambodian operation , because of the achievements of the South Vietnamese operation in Laos , I am announcing an increase in the rate of American withdrawals . Between May 1 and December 1 of this year , 100 , 000 more American troops will be brought home from South Vietnam . This will bring the total number of American troops withdrawn from South Vietnam to 365 , 000 . Now that is over two thirds of the number who were there when I came into office , as you can see from this chart on my left . The Government of South Vietnam fully supports the decision I have just announced . Now , let us look at the future As you can see from the progress we have made to date and by this announcement tonight , the American involvement in Vietnam is coming to an end . The day the South Vietnamese can take over their own defense is in sight . Our goal is a total American withdrawal from Vietnam . We can and we will reach that goal through our program of Vietnamization if necessary . But we would infinitely prefer to reach it even sooner through negotiations . I am sure most of you will recall that on October 7 of last year in a national TV broadcast , I proposed an immediate cease fire throughout Indochina , the immediate release of all prisoners of war in the Indochina area , an all Indochina peace conference , the complete withdrawal of all outside forces , and a political settlement . Tonight I again call on Hanoi to engage in serious negotiations to speed the end of this war . I especially call on Hanoi to agree to the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of war throughout Indochina . It is time for Hanoi to end the barbaric use of our prisoners as negotiating pawns and to join us in a humane act that will free their men as well as ours . Let me turn now to a proposal which at first glance has a great deal of popular appeal . If our goal is a total withdrawal of all our forces , why do not I announce a date now for ending our involvement Well , the difficulty in making such an announcement to the American people is that I would also be making that announcement to the enemy . And it would serve the enemy s purpose and not our own . If the United States should announce that we will quit regardless of what the enemy does , we would have thrown away our principal bargaining counter to win the release of American prisoners of war , we would remove the enemy s strongest incentive to end the war sooner by negotiation , and we will have given enemy commanders the exact information they need to marshal their attacks against our remaining forces at their most vulnerable time . The issue very simply is this Shall we leave Vietnam in a way that by our own actions consciously turns the country over to the Communists Or shall we leave in a way that gives the South Vietnamese a reasonable chance to survive as a free people My plan will end American involvement in a way that would provide that chance . And the other plan would end it precipitately and give victory to the Communists . In a deeper sense , we have the choice of ending our involvement in this war on a note of despair or on a note of hope . I believe , as Thomas Jefferson did , that Americans will always choose hope over despair . We have it in our power to leave Vietnam in a way that offers a brave people a realistic hope of freedom . We have it in our power to prove to our friends in the world that America s sense of responsibility remains the world s greatest single hope of peace . And above all , we have it in our power to close a difficult chapter in American history , not meanly but nobly so that each one of us can come out of this searing experience with a measure of pride in our Nation , confidence in our own character , and hope for the future of the spirit of America . I know there are those who honestly believe that I should move to end this war without regard to what happens to South Vietnam . This way would abandon our friends . But even more important , we would abandon ourselves . We would plunge from the anguish of war into a nightmare of recrimination . We would lose respect for this Nation , respect for one another , respect for ourselves . I understand the deep concerns which have been raised in this country , fanned by reports of brutalities in Vietnam . Let me put this into perspective . I have visited Vietnam many times , and , speaking now from that experience and as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces , I feel it is my duty to speak up for the two and a half million fine young Americans who have served in Vietnam . The atrocity charges in individual cases should not and cannot be allowed to reflect on their courage and their self sacrifice . War is a terrible and cruel experience for a nation , and it is particularly terrible and cruel for those who bear the burden of fighting . But never in history have men fought for less selfish motives not for conquest , not for glory , but only for the right of a people far away to choose the kind of government they want . While we hear and read much of isolated acts of cruelty , we do not hear enough of the tens of thousands of individual American soldiers I have seen them there building schools , roads , hospitals , clinics , who , through countless acts of generosity and kindness , have tried to help the people of South Vietnam . We can and we should be very proud of these men . They deserve not our scorn , but they deserve our admiration and our deepest appreciation . The way to express that appreciation is to end America s participation in this conflict not in failure or in defeat , but in achievement of the great goals for which they fought a South Vietnam free to determine its own future and an America no longer divided by war but united in peace . That is why it is so important how we end this war . By our decision we will demonstrate the kind of people we are and the kind of country we will become . That is why I have chartered the course I have laid out tonight to end this war but end it in a way that will strengthen trust for America around the world , not undermine it , in a way that will redeem the sacrifices that have been made , not insult them , in a way that will heal this Nation , not tear it apart . I can assure you tonight with confidence that American involvement in this war is coming to an end . But can you believe this I understand why this question is raised by many very honest and sincere people . Because many times in the past in this long and difficult war , actions have been announced from Washington which were supposed to lead to a reduction of American involvement in Vietnam . And over and over these actions resulted in more Americans going to Vietnam and more casualties in Vietnam . Tonight I do not ask you to take what I say on faith . Look at the record . Look again at this chart on my left . Every action taken by this Administration , every decision made , has accomplished what I said it would accomplish . They have reduced American involvement . They have drastically reduced our casualties . In my campaign for the Presidency , I pledged to end American involvement in this war . I am keeping that pledge . And I expect to be held accountable by the American people if I fail . I am often asked what I would like to accomplish more than anything else while serving as President of the United States . And I always give the same answer to bring peace peace abroad , peace at home for America . The reason I am so deeply committed to peace goes far beyond political considerations or my concern about my place in history , or the other reasons that political scientists usually say are the motivations of Presidents . Every time I talk to a brave wife of an American POevery time I write a letter to the mother of a boy who has been killed in Vietnam , I become more deeply committed to end this war , and to end it in a way that we can build lasting peace . I think the hardest thing that a President has to do is to present posthumously the Nation s highest honor , the Medal of Honor , to mothers or fathers or widows of men who have lost their lives , but in the process have saved the lives of others . We had an award ceremony in the East Room of the White House just a few weeks ago . And at that ceremony I remember one of the recipients , Karl Taylor , from Pennsylvania . Her husband was a Marine sergeant , Sergeant Karl Taylor . He charged an enemy machine gun single handed and knocked it out . He lost his life . But in the process the lives of several wounded Marines in the range of that machine gun were saved . After I presented her the Medal , I shook hands with their two children , Karl , he was 8 years old and Kevin , who was 4 . As I was about to move to the next recipient , Kevin suddenly stood at attention and saluted . I found it rather difficult to get my thoughts together for the next presentation . My fellow Americans , I want to end this war in a way that is worthy of the sacrifice of Karl Taylor , and I think he would want me to end it in a way that would increase the chances that Kevin and Karl , and all those children like them here and around the world , could grow up in a world where none of them would have to die in war that would increase the chance for America to have what it has not had in this century a full generation of peace . We have come a long way in the last two years toward that goal . With your continued support , I believe we will achieve that goal . And generations in the future will look back at this difficult , trying time in America s history and they will be proud that we demonstrated that we had the courage and the character of a great people . Thank you .<speech_sep>Ladies and gentlemen , before going to your questions , I have a brief report on the energy situation , the progress we have made to date , and also the problems that we have in the future . You will recall that last October when we saw the energy crisis developing as a result of the embargo and other matters , that there were dire predictions that we would have problems with home heating oil and , even , fuel to run our factories . As a result of the cooperation of the American people and they deserve most of the credit and also the management on the part of Simon and his organization , we have now passed through that crisis . The home fuel oil , as far as it is concerned , as we know , has been furnished no one has suffered as a result . And as far as our plants are concerned , all have had the fuel that is required to keep the plants going . The major problem that remains is one that was brought home to me when I talked to one of the soundmen before coming in . I asked him if he was having any trouble getting gas . He said , Yes , when I went to the service station this morning , they would not give me any because my gage was wrong . They thought that I had more than half a tank . Actually , I had zero in the tank . I have seen this problem as I have driven around in the Miami area and also in the Washington area the gas lines , the fact , too , that in the Eastern States generally we do have a problem of shortage of gasoline , which has been , of course , very difficult for many people going to work , going to school , or what have you . Simon last week , as you know , at my direction allocated additional gasoline for these particular areas , and he is prepared to take more action in the future to deal with this problem . As far as the entire situation is concerned , I am able to report tonight that as a result of the cooperation of the American people , as a result , too , of our own energy conservation program within the Government , that I now believe confidently that there is much better than an even chance that there will be no need for gas rationing in the United States . As far as that is concerned , however , I should point out that while the crisis has passed , the problem still remains , and it is a very serious one . And having reported somewhat positively up to this point , let me point out some of the negative situations that we confront . One has to do with the Congress . The Congress , of course , is working hard on this problem , but I regret to say that the bill presently before the Congress is one that if it reaches my desk in its present form , I will have to veto it . I will have to veto it , because what it does is simply to manage the shortage rather than to deal with the real problem and what should be our real goal , and that is to get rid of the shortage . For example , there is a provision in the bill , the present bill , that provides for a rollback of prices . Now this , of course , would be immediately popular , but it would mean , if we did have such a rollback , that we would not only have more and longer gas lines , but a rollback of prices would lead to shortages which would require , without question , rationing all over the country . That would mean 17 , 000 to 20 , 000 more Federal bureaucrats to run the system at a cost of 1 1 2 billion a year . And this we should avoid . This we can avoid . And that is why I again urge the Congress to act responsibly on the measures that we have presented to the Congress to deal with the problem of price and profits through the windfall profits measure that we have submitted and to deal with the problem of gas shortage overall by getting more supplies , and that means the deregulation of natural gas so that it is competitive as far as price is concerned the amendment of some of our environmental actions so that we can use more coal and thereby take some of the pressure off of the demands for gasoline and other fuels the deepwater ports and the other measures that I have mentioned on many occasions to the Nation and also before members of the press . Looking to the future , I believe , we can say now that while the crisis has been passed , the problem remains . It is a serious problem , but it is one that can be dealt with . And our goal of becoming completely independent in energy , independent of any foreign source , is one that we can achieve , but it will require the continued cooperation of the American people , which I am sure we will get , and responsible action by the Congress , action directed not simply toward distributing a shortage and making it worse , but action which will increase supplies and thereby get rid of the shortage . Miss Thomas , I think you are number one tonight . Miss Thomas , as you know , the matter of the Judiciary Committee s investigation is now being discussed by White House Counsel , Clair , and Doar . And as I indicated in my State of the Union Address , I am prepared to cooperate with the committee in any way consistent with my constitutional responsibility to defend the Office of the Presidency against any action which would weaken that office and the ability of future Presidents to carry out the great responsibilities that any President will have . Doar is conducting those negotiations with Clair , and whatever is eventually arranged , which will bring a prompt resolution of this matter , I will cooperate in . Cormier , the problem of inflation is still a very nagging one . The last figures , as you know , the one percent increase in one month of the consumer price index , was a very troublesome one . Looking to the future , we are keenly aware of this problem , and we are preparing to deal with it . First , we believe that it is vitally important to get at the source of the problem . One is in the field of energy . The way to get at the source of the problem in the field of energy is to increase supplies . I have already directed my comments to that point . The other is in the field of food , and in the field of food we have the same objective to increase supplies . And Secretary Butz indicates to me and to other members of the Cabinet and the Cost of Living Council that he expects that our supplies , through the balance of this year , of food will go up and that that will have a restraining influence as far as food costs are concerned . With regard to inflation , I should point out , too , that almost two thirds of the price increase , the increase in prices last year , which was at a very high rate , was due to energy and also to the problem of food . By getting at these two problems and by continuing our Cost of Living Council activities in the areas that Secretary Shultz has testified to , I believe that we will bring inflation under control as the year goes on . But I would not underestimate the problem . We are going to continue to fight it . It is going to have to take responsibility on the part of the Congress to keep the Budget within the limits that we have laid out . It is also going to take an effort on the part of our farmers , an effort on the part of the Administration in the field of energy and the rest , so that we can get the supplies up , because the answer to higher prices is not simply controls . Controls have been tried , and controls have been found wanting . The answer to higher prices is to get up the supplies . That will bring the price down . Well , this is a matter , Jarriel , that has been discussed by Clair with Doar , and the decision will be made , based on what arrangements are developed between the two for the confidentiality of those particular items where they must remain confidential and also based on whether or not turning over to the committee will , in any way , jeopardize the rights of defendants or impair the ability of the prosecution to carry on its proper functions in the cases that may develop . It is a matter that we are talking about , and it is a matter where we will be cooperative within those guidelines . Well , Rather , you do not have to be a constitutional lawyer to know that the Constitution is very precise in defining what is an impeachable offense . And in this respect it is the opinion of White House Counsel and a number of other constitutional lawyers , who are perhaps more up to date on this than I am at this time , that a criminal offense on the part of the President is the requirement for impeachment . This is a matter which will be presented , however , to the committee by Clair in a brief which he presently is preparing . I believe that the lines for gasoline will become shorter in the spring and summer months . In fact , that is the purpose of our program , and I think we will achieve it . As far as the price of gasoline is concerned , I would be less than candid if I were not to say that the price of gasoline is not going to go down until more supplies of gasoline come into the country and also until other fuels come on stream which will reduce the pressure which is upward on the price of gasoline . Obviously , too , when the embargo is lifted , that is and will have some effect on the price of gasoline . The embargo question is one that I know is on the minds of all of us , and it is one that presently is under consideration , as you know , by the oil producing countries . I should point out here that Kissinger s trip to the Mideast is directed toward getting a disengagement or getting talks started with regard to a disengagement on the Syrian front . That , following on the disengagement on the Egyptian front , I think , will have a positive effect , although it is not linked to the problem of the embargo directly . If I could perhaps elaborate just a bit on that As far as the oil producing countries are concerned we believe it is in their interest to lift the embargo . They should do that independently of what happens on the front of the negotiation with regard to developing a permanent peace in the Mideast . As far as we are concerned , we believe that getting a permanent peace in the Mideast is a goal worth achieving , apart from the embargo . But while they are not conditioned on one another by either party , what happens in one area inevitably affects what happens in the other . And I can say , based on the conversations I have had with the foreign ministers I met with last week and based on the reports I have received to date , I believe we are going to make continued progress on the peace front . I believe that will be helpful in bringing progress on getting the embargo lifted . By the same token , if the embargo is not lifted , it will naturally slow down the efforts that we are making on the peace front . And it is because I believe that we are going to make progress in developing those particular items that are essential towards movement toward a permanent peace in the Mideast that the oil producing countries will conclude that they should move on the embargo front . Well , I believe it is a matter of record that the Special Prosecutor transmitted a request that I testify before the grand jury , and on constitutional grounds , I respectfully declined to do so . I did offer , of course , to respond to any interrogatories that the Special Prosecutor might want to submit or to meet with him personally and answer questions , and he indicated that he did not want to proceed in that way . Well , a full impeachment trial in the Senate , under our Constitution , comes only when the House determines that there is an impeachable offense . It is my belief that the House , after it conducts its inquiry , will not reach that determination . I do not expect to be impeached . First , I would not say that the Shah was irresponsible and reckless . However , his information , I think , is different from ours , and we have good reason to know what we are getting . We are getting substantially less from the oil producing countries in the Mideast than we were before the embargo . That is why we are , of course , very anxious to get the embargo lifted as soon as possible . With regard to my statement that there will be no recession , I have met with my economic advisers just last week . I went over this question in great detail . We are going through what I would say is a downturn in the economy at this point , but not a recession . And for the balance of the year , the prospects are good . They are good , because we are going to be dealing with the energy crisis what was a crisis as a problem . That will be helpful . We expect to have an increase insofar as food is concerned , and as far as other elements of the economy are concerned , there are very great areas of strength . The last half of the year we expect to be on an upward curve rather than the down curve . However , those are projections made by economists , and I gave directions to the Office of Management and Budget , Ash , and to our economic advisers that we will be and should be prepared to deal effectively with any areas of the country and there may be spot areas of hardship through the budget means , and we have various contingency plans ready to go . We will not stand by and allow this country because of the energy crisis and because of some of the problems we have had on the inflation front stand by and allow a recession to occur . That is why I have been so positive in saying that there will be no recession . I had better turn this way . You have the loudest voice , you go right ahead . Well , this is a question which you very properly bring to the attention of the Nation . It is a question that has already been brought to my attention , I am sure , by a number of people and the question if I may give the answer now is very simply this . Don Johnson of the Veterans Administration , as you know , acted expeditiously when we had a case in California . We have another one in Illinois at the present time . There are great numbers of veterans . We have an adequate program to deal with it , and I can assure you that when any matter is brought to my attention or to his , we will deal with it as quickly as we can , because our Vietnam veterans and all veterans deserve whatever the law provides for them , and I will see that they get it . Well , if he is not listening to this program , I will report to him just what you said . He may have heard even though he was not listening to the program . The others were not political First , I want Republican candidates to win where they are deserving candidates . And second , I recall the year 1948 when we confidently expected to gain in the House and when Fulbright , as you may recall , called for President Truman s resignation in the spring because the economy was in a slump and President Truman had other problems , and we proceeded to campaign against Truman . He was the issue . And we took a bad licking in the Congress in 1948 . What my advice to the candidates very simply would be is this It is that 9 months before an election , no one can predict what can happen in this country . What will affect the election in this year 1974 is what always affects elections peace and prosperity . On the peace front , we are doing well , and I think we will continue to do well . With regard to the prosperity issue , the bread and butter issue , as I have already indicated , I think that this economy is going to be moving up . I think , therefore , it will be a good year for those candidates who stand for the Administration . With regard to any State taxes or concern , I will pay any that the law requires . As I understand , in California a ruling has been made , apparently , that even though I have a residence in California that there is not a requirement that I pay California taxes . I would be glad to pay those taxes and , of course , deduct that from my Federal income tax liability as others can do if they desire to do so . With regard to the gift of papers that I made to the Government , there is no question about my intent . All of my Vice Presidential papers were delivered to the Archives in March , 4 months before the deadline . The paperwork on it apparently was not concluded until after that time . This raises a legal question as to whether or not the deduction , therefore , is proper . That is why I voluntarily asked the Senate control committee of the House and Senate to look into the matter and to advise me as to whether or not the deduction was a proper one . If it was not a proper one , of course , will be glad to pay the tax . Well , my personal reaction is that I am , of course , an admirer of a man who has won a Nobel Prize for literature and one who has also shown , as he has shown , such great courage . Second , as far as our relations with the Soviets are concerned , if I thought that breaking relations with the Soviets or turning off our policy of negotiation and turning back to confrontation would help him or help thousands of others like him in the Soviet Union , we might do that . On the other hand , I look back to the years of confrontation , and I find that men like him , as a matter of fact , rather than being sent to Paris , would have been sent to Siberia or probably worse . As far as our relations with the Soviets are concerned , we shall continue . We shall continue to negotiate , recognizing that they do not like our system or approve of it and I do not like their system or approve of it . Brezhnev knows that , and I know it , and we have discussed it quite bluntly and directly . However , it is essential that both nations , being the super powers that we are , continue to make progress toward limiting arms , toward avoiding confrontations which might explode into war , as it might have in the Mideast if we had not had this period of negotiation , and also continuing those negotiations for reduction of forces in Europe and reduction of arms , or certainly the limitation of arms , and the various other initiatives that we are undertaking with the Soviets . In a nutshell , this is what we have to consider Do we want to go back to a period when the United States and the Soviet Union , the two great super powers , stood in confrontation against each other and risk a runaway nuclear arms race and also crisis in Berlin , in the Mideast , even again in Southeast Asia or other places of the world , or do we want to continue on a path in which we recognize our differences but try to recognize also the fact that we must either live together or we will all die together No . I want my party to succeed , but more important , I want the Presidency to survive . And it is vitally important in this Nation that the Presidency of the United States not be hostage to what happens to the popularity of a President at one time or another . The stability of this office , the ability of the President to continue to govern , the ability , for example , of this President to continue the great initiatives which have led to a more peaceful world than we have had for a generation , and to move on the domestic front in the many areas that I have described , all of these things , these goals , are yet before us . We have a lot of work left to do , more than 3 years left to do , and I am going to stay here until I get it done . Well , as a matter of fact , in the privacy message , which , as you know , I issued on Saturday , I did not raise this question specifically , but certainly I want that question , along with others , considered . Because in this whole area of privacy , it is not just a question of those who run credit bureaus and banks and others with their huge computers , but the Federal Government itself , in its activities , can very much impinge on the privacy of individuals . This is a matter that I think should be considered by the Commission that I have appointed , which is chaired , as you know , by the Vice President . The answer to the first question is no the answer to the second question is yes . And I would go further and say that ambassadorships have not been for sale , to my knowledge , ambassadorships cannot be purchased , and I would not approve an ambassadorship unless the man or woman was qualified , clearly apart from any contributions . It would be very easy for me to jump on the Vice President when he is down . I can only say that in his period of service that he rendered dedicated service in all of the assignments that I gave to him . He went through , along with his family , a terribly difficult situation , and he resigned , as I think he thought he should , because of the embarrassment that he knew that would cause to the Administration and also because he felt that in view of the criminal offense that was charged that he should not stay in office . Now at this point , I am not going to join anybody else in kicking him when he is down . Well , I would point out that those who made deductions , such as I made in this particular instance , included John Kenneth Galbraith , Jerome Wiesner , Vice President Humphrey , President Johnson , a number of others . I did not write that law . When it was brought to my attention , rather vigorously by President Johnson when I saw him shortly after my election , he thought that it would be wise for me to give my papers to the Government and take the proper deduction . I did that . Under the circumstances , as you know now , that deduction is no longer allowed . As far as I am concerned , I think that was probably a proper decision . Lisagor , we were informed that they were calling an urgent meeting . We expected that to take place on the 14th of February , but the Arab leaders , as you know , are not a united group necessarily , and that is an understatement . Under the circumstances , while the Arab leaders who had given us this assurance tried to go forward with the meeting , they were unable to get the cooperation of others . I believe now , however , that they will get that cooperation , that the meeting will be held , and I believe that they will lift the embargo .<speech_sep>Good evening my fellow Americans Ten days ago , in my report to the Nation on Vietnam , I announced a decision to withdraw an additional 150 , 000 Americans from Vietnam over the next year . I said then that I was making that decision despite our concern over increased enemy activity in Laos , in Cambodia , and in South Vietnam . At that time , I warned that if I concluded that increased enemy activity in any of these areas endangered the fives of Americans remaining in Vietnam , I would not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation . Despite that warning , North Vietnam has increased its military aggression in all these areas , and particularly in Cambodia . After full consultation with the National Security Council , Ambassador Bunker , General Abrams , and my other advisers , I have concluded that the actions of the enemy in the last 10 days clearly endanger the lives of Americans who are in Vietnam now and would constitute an unacceptable risk to those who will be there after withdrawal of another 150 , 000 . To protect our men who are in Vietnam and to guarantee the continued success of our withdrawal and Vietnamization programs , I have concluded that the time has come for action . Tonight , I shall describe the actions of the enemy , the actions I have ordered to deal with that situation , and the reasons for my decision . Cambodia , a small country of 7 million people , has been a neutral nation since the Geneva agreement of 1954 an agreement , incidentally , which was signed by the Government of North Vietnam . American policy since then has been to scrupulously respect the neutrality of the Cambodian people . We have maintained a skeleton diplomatic mission of fewer than 15 in Cambodia s capital , and that only since last August . For the previous 4 years , from 1965 to 1969 , we did not have any diplomatic mission whatever in Cambodia . And for the past 5 years , we have provided no military assistance whatever and no economic assistance to Cambodia . North Vietnam , however , has not respected that neutrality . For the past 5 years as indicated on this map that you see here North Vietnam has occupied military sanctuaries all along the Cambodian frontier with South Vietnam . Some of these extend up to 20 miles into Cambodia . The sanctuaries are in red and , as you note , they are on both sides of the border . They are used for hit and run attacks on American and South Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam . These Communist occupied territories contain major base camps , training sites , logistics facilities , weapons and ammunition factories , airstrips , and prisoner of war compounds . For 5 years , neither the United States nor South Vietnam has moved against these enemy sanctuaries because we did not wish to violate the territory of a neutral nation . Even after the Vietnamese Communists began to expand these sanctuaries four weeks ago , we counseled patience to our South Vietnamese allies and imposed restraints on our own commanders . In contrast to our policy , the enemy in the past two weeks has stepped up his guerrilla actions and he is concentrating his main forces in these sanctuaries that you see on this map where they are building up to launch massive attacks on our forces and those of South Vietnam . North Vietnam in the last two weeks has stripped away all pretense of respecting the sovereignty or the neutrality of Cambodia . Thousands of their soldiers are invading the country from the sanctuaries they are encircling the capital of Phnom Penh . Coming from these sanctuaries , as you see here , they have moved into Cambodia and are encircling the capital . Cambodia , as a result of this , has sent out a call to the United States , to a number of other nations , for assistance . Because if this enemy effort succeeds , Cambodia would become a vast enemy staging area and a springboard for attacks on South Vietnam along 600 miles of frontier a refuge where enemy troops could return from combat without fear of retaliation . North Vietnamese men and supplies could then be poured into that country , jeopardizing not only the lives of our own men but the people of South Vietnam as well . Now confronted with this situation , we have three options . First , we can do nothing . Well , the ultimate result of that course of action is clear . Unless we indulge in wishful thinking , the lives of Americans remaining in Vietnam after our next withdrawal of 150 , 000 would be gravely threatened . Let us go to the map again . Here is South Vietnam . Here is North Vietnam . North Vietnam already occupies this part of Laos . If North Vietnam also occupied this whole band in Cambodia , or the entire country , it would mean that South Vietnam was completely outflanked and the forces of Americans in this area , as well as the South Vietnamese , would be in an untenable military position . Our second choice is to provide massive military assistance to Cambodia itself . Now unfortunately , while we deeply sympathize with the plight of seven million Cambodians whose country is being invaded , massive amounts of military assistance could not be rapidly and effectively utilized by the small Cambodian Army against the immediate threat . With other nations , we shall do our best to provide the small arms and other equipment which the Cambodian Army of 40 , 000 needs and can use for its defense . But the aid we will provide will be limited to the purpose of enabling Cambodia to defend its neutrality and not for the purpose of making it an active belligerent on one side or the other . Our third choice is to go to the heart of the trouble . That means cleaning out major North Vietnamese and Vietcong occupied territories these sanctuaries which serve as bases for attacks on both Cambodia and American and South Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam . Some of these , incidentally , are as close to Saigon as Baltimore is to Washington . This one , for example , is called the Parrot s Beak . It is only 33 miles from Saigon . Now faced with these three options , this is the decision I have made . In cooperation with the armed forces of South Vietnam , attacks are being launched this week to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on the Cambodian Vietnam border . A major responsibility for the ground operations is being assumed by South Vietnamese forces . For example , the attacks in several areas , including the Parrot s Beak that I referred to a moment ago , are exclusively South Vietnamese ground operations under South Vietnamese command with the United States providing air and logistical support . There is one area , however , immediately above Parrot s Beak , where I have concluded that a combined American and South Vietnamese operation is necessary . Tonight , American and South Vietnamese units will attack the headquarters for the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam . This key control center has been occupied by the North Vietnamese and Vietcong for five years in blatant violation of Cambodia s neutrality . This is not an invasion of Cambodia . The areas in which these attacks will be launched are completely occupied and controlled by North Vietnamese forces . Our purpose is not to occupy the areas . Once enemy forces are driven out of these sanctuaries and once their military supplies are destroyed , we will withdraw . These actions are in no way directed to the security interests of any nation . Any government that chooses to use these actions as a pretext for harming relations with the United States will be doing so on its own responsibility , and on its own initiative , and we will draw the appropriate conclusions . Now let me give you the reasons for my decision . A majority of the American people , a majority of you listening to me , are for the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam . The action I have taken tonight is indispensable for the continuing success of that withdrawal program . A majority of the American people want to end this war rather than to have it drag on interminably . The action I have taken tonight will serve that purpose . A majority of the American people want to keep the casualties of our brave men in Vietnam at an absolute minimum . The action I take tonight is essential if we are to accomplish that goal . We take this action not for the purpose of expanding the war into Cambodia but for the purpose of ending the war in Vietnam and winning the just peace we all desire . We have made we will continue to make every possible effort to end this war through negotiation at the conference table rather than through more fighting on the battlefield . Let us look again at the record . We have stopped the bombing of North Vietnam . We have cut air operations by over 20 percent . We have announced withdrawal of over 250 , 000 of our men . We have offered to withdraw all of our men if they will withdraw theirs . We have offered to negotiate all issues with only one condition and that is that the future of South Vietnam be determined not by North Vietnam , and not by the United States , but by the people of South Vietnam themselves . The answer of the enemy has been intransigence at the conference table , belligerence in Hanoi , massive military aggression in Laos and Cambodia , and stepped up attacks in South Vietnam , designed to increase American casualties . This attitude has become intolerable . We will not react to this threat to American lives merely by plaintive diplomatic protests . If we did , the credibility of the United States would be destroyed in every area of the world where only the power of the United States deters aggression . Tonight , I again warn the North Vietnamese that if they continue to escalate the fighting when the United States is withdrawing its forces , I shall meet my responsibility as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces to take the action I consider necessary to defend the security of our American men . The action that I have announced tonight puts the leaders of North Vietnam on notice that we will be patient in working for peace we will be conciliatory at the conference table , but we will not be humiliated . We will not be defeated . We will not allow American men by the thousands to be killed by an enemy from privileged sanctuaries . The time came long ago to end this war through peaceful negotiations . We stand ready for those negotiations . We have made major efforts , many of which must remain secret . I say tonight All the offers and approaches made previously remain on the conference table whenever Hanoi is ready to negotiate seriously . But if the enemy response to our most conciliatory offers for peaceful negotiation continues to be to increase its attacks and humiliate and defeat us , we shall react accordingly . My fellow Americans , we live in an age of anarchy , both abroad and at home . We see mindless attacks on all the great institutions which have been created by free civilizations in the last 500 years . Even here in the United States , great universities are being systematically destroyed . Small nations all over the world find themselves under attack from within and from without . If , when the chips are down , the world s most powerful nation , the United States of America , acts like a pitiful , helpless giant , the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world . It is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight . The question all Americans must ask and answer tonight is this Does the richest and strongest nation in the history of the world have the character to meet a direct challenge by a group which rejects every effort to win a just peace , ignores our warning , tramples on solemn agreements , violates the neutrality of an unarmed people , and uses our prisoners as hostages If we fail to meet this challenge , all other nations will be on notice that despite its overwhelming power the United States , when a real crisis comes , will be found wanting . During my campaign for the Presidency , I pledged to bring Americans home from Vietnam . They are coming home . I promised to end this war . I shall keep that promise . I promised to win a just peace . I shall keep that promise . We shall avoid a wider war . But we are also determined to put an end to this war . In this room , Woodrow Wilson made the great decisions which led to victory in World War Franklin Roosevelt made the decisions which led to our victory in World War IDwight Eisenhower made decisions which ended the war in Korea and avoided war in the Middle East . John Kennedy , in his finest hour , made the great decision which removed Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba and the Western Hemisphere . I have noted that there has been a great deal of discussion with regard to this decision that I have made and I should point out that I do not contend that it is in the same magnitude as these decisions that I have just mentioned . But between those decisions and this decision there is a difference that is very fundamental . In those decisions , the American people were not assailed by counsels of doubt and defeat from some of the most widely known opinion leaders of the Nation . I have noted , for example , that a Republican Senator has said that this action I have taken means that my party has lost all chance of winning the November elections . And others are saying today that this move against enemy sanctuaries will make me a one term President . No one is more aware than I am of the political consequences of the action I have taken . It is tempting to take the easy political path to blame this war on previous administrations and to bring all of our men home immediately , regardless of the consequences , even though that would mean defeat for the United States to desert 18 million South Vietnamese people , who have put their trust in us and to expose them to the same slaughter and savagery which the leaders of North Vietnam inflicted on hundreds of thousands of North Vietnamese who chose freedom when the Communists took over North Vietnam in 1954 to get peace at any price now , even though I know that a peace of humiliation for the United States would lead to a bigger war or surrender later . I have rejected all political considerations in making this decision . Whether my party gains in November is nothing compared to the lives of 400 , 000 brave Americans fighting for our country and for the cause of peace and freedom in Vietnam . Whether I may be a one term President is insignificant compared to whether by our failure to act in this crisis the United States proves itself to be unworthy to lead the forces of freedom in this critical period in world history . I would rather be a one term President and do what I believe is right than to be a two term President at the cost of seeing America become a second rate power and to see this Nation accept the first defeat in its proud 190 year history . I realize that in this war there are honest and deep differences in this country about whether we should have become involved , that there are differences as to how the war should have been conducted . But the decision I announce tonight transcends those differences . For the lives of American men are involved . The opportunity for Americans to come home in the next 12 months is involved . The future of 18 million people in South Vietnam and 7 million people in Cambodia is involved . The possibility of winning a just peace in Vietnam and in the Pacific is at stake . It is customary to conclude a speech from the White House by asking support for the President of the United States . Tonight , I depart from that precedent . What I ask is far more important . I ask for your support for our brave men fighting tonight halfway around the world not for territory not for glory but so that their younger brothers and their sons and your sons can have a chance to grow up in a world of peace and freedom and justice . Thank you and good night .<speech_sep>
