To the Senate and House of Representatives I transmit herewith , for your information , a letter from the Secretary of State , inclosing a report of the International American Conference , which recommends that reciprocal commercial treaties be entered into between the United States and the several other Republics of this hemisphere . It has been so often and so persistently stated that our tariff laws offered an insurmountable barrier to a large exchange of products with the Latin American nations that I deem it proper to call especial attention to the fact that more than 87 per cent of the products of those nations sent to our ports are now admitted free . If sugar is placed upon the free list , practically every important article exported from those States will be given untaxed access to our markets , except wool . The real difficulty in the way of negotiating profitable reciprocity treaties is that we have given freely so much that would have had value in the mutual concessions which such treaties imply . I can not doubt , however , that the present advantages which the products of these near and friendly States enjoy in our markets , though they are not by law exclusive , will , with other considerations , favorably dispose them to adopt such measures , by treaty or otherwise , as will tend to equalize and greatly enlarge our mutual exchanges . It will certainly be time enough for us to consider whether we must cheapen the cost of production by cheapening labor in order to gain access to the South American markets when we have fairly tried the effect of established and reliable steam communication and of convenient methods of money exchanges . There can be no doubt , I think , that with these facilities well established and with a rebate of duties upon imported raw materials used in the manufacture of goods for export our merchants will be able to compete in the ports of the Latin American nations with those of any other country . If after the Congress shall have acted upon pending tariff legislation it shall appear that under the general treaty making power , or under any special powers given by law , our trade with the States represented in the conference can be enlarged upon a basis of mutual advantage , it will be promptly done .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives The sudden death of the William Windore , Secretary of the Treasury , in New York , on the evening of the 29th instant , has directed my attention to the present state of the law as to the filling of a vacancy occasioned by the death of the head of a Department . I transmit herewith an opinion of the Attorney General , from which it will be seen that under the statutes in force no officer in the Treasury Department or other person designated by me can exercise the duties of Secretary of the Treasury for a longer period than ten days . This limitation is , I am sure , unwise , and necessarily involves in such a case as that now presented undue haste and even indelicacy . The President should not be required to take up the question of the selection of a successor before the last offices of affection and respect have been paid to the dead . If the proprieties of an occasion as sad as that which now overshadows us are observed , possibly one half of the brief time allowed is gone before , with due regard to the decencies of life , the President and those with whom he should advise can take up the consideration of the grave duty of selecting a head for one of the greatest Departments of the Government . Hasty action by the Senate is also necessarily involved , and geographical limitations are practically imposed by the necessity of selecting someone who can reach the capital and take the necessary oath of office before the expiration of the ten days . It may be a very proper restriction of the power of the President in this connection that he shall not designate for any great length of time a person to discharge these important duties who has not been confirmed by the Senate , but there would seem to be no reason why one of the assistant secretaries of the Department wherein the vacancy exists might not discharge the duties of Secretary until a successor is selected , confirmed , and qualified . The inconvenience of this limitation was made apparent at the time of the death of Secretary Folger . President Arthur in that case allowed one of the assistant secretaries , who had been designated to act in the absence of the Secretary , to continue in the discharge of such duties for ten days , then designated the same person to discharge the duties for a further term of ten days , and then made a temporary appointment as Secretary , in order to secure the consideration that he needed in filling this important place . I recommend such a modification of the existing law as will permit the first or sole assistant , or , in the case of the Treasury Department , where the assistants are not graded , that one who may be designated by the President , to discharge the duties of the head of the Department until a successor is appointed and qualified .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens There is no constitutional or legal requirement that the President shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people , but there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that from the beginning of the Government the people , to whose service the official oath consecrates the officer , have been called to witness the solemn ceremonial . The oath taken in the presence of the people becomes a mutual covenant . The officer covenants to serve the whole body of the people by a faithful execution of the laws , so that they may be the unfailing defense and security of those who respect and observe them , and that neither wealth , station , nor the power of combinations shall be able to evade their just penalties or to wrest them from a beneficent public purpose to serve the ends of cruelty or selfishness . My promise is spoken yours unspoken , but not the less real and solemn . The people of every State have here their representatives . Surely I do not misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when I assume that the whole body of the people covenant with me and with each other to day to support and defend the Constitution and the Union of the States , to yield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every other citizen his equal civil and political rights . Entering thus solemnly into covenant with each other , we may reverently invoke and confidently expect the favor and help of Almighty God that He will give to me wisdom , strength , and fidelity , and to our people a spirit of fraternity and a love of righteousness and peace . This occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the Presidential term which begins this day is the twenty sixth under our Constitution . The first inauguration of President Washington took place in New York , where Congress was then sitting , on the 30th day of April , 1789 , having been deferred by reason of delays attending the organization of the Congress and the canvass of the electoral vote . Our people have already worthily observed the centennials of the Declaration of Independence , of the battle of Yorktown , and of the adoption of the Constitution , and will shortly celebrate in New York the institution of the second great department of our constitutional scheme of government . When the centennial of the institution of the judicial department , by the organization of the Supreme Court , shall have been suitably observed , as I trust it will be , our nation will have fully entered its second century . I will not attempt to note the marvelous and in great part happy contrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold into its second century of organized existence under the Constitution and that weak but wisely ordered young nation that looked undauntedly down the first century , when all its years stretched out before it . Our people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which accompanied the institution of government under the Constitution , or to find inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of Washington and his great associates , and hope and courage in the contrast which thirty eight populous and prosperous States offer to the thirteen States , weak in everything except courage and the love of liberty , that then fringed our Atlantic seaboard . The Territory of Dakota has now a population greater than any of the original States except Virginia and greater than the aggregate of five of the smaller States in 1790 . The center of population when our national capital was located was east of Baltimore , and it was argued by many well informed persons that it would move eastward rather than westward yet in 1880 it was found to be near Cincinnati , and the new census about to be taken will show another stride to the westward . That which was the body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nation s robe . But our growth has not been limited to territory , population and aggregate wealth , marvelous as it has been in each of those directions . The masses of our people are better fed , clothed , and housed than their fathers were . The facilities for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused . The virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of our people . The influences of religion have been multiplied and strengthened . The sweet offices of charity have greatly increased . The virtue of temperance is held in higher estimation . We have not attained an ideal condition . Not all of our people are happy and prosperous not all of them are virtuous and law abiding . But on the whole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were here one hundred years ago . The surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the General Government , effected by the adoption of the Constitution , was not accomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly reenforced by the more imperative voice of experience . The divergent interests of peace speedily demanded a more perfect union . The merchant , the shipmaster , and the manufacturer discovered and disclosed to our statesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation must be added to the political freedom which had been so bravely won . The commercial policy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its hard and oppressive features . To hold in check the development of our commercial marine , to prevent or retard the establishment and growth of manufactures in the States , and so to secure the American market for their shops and the carrying trade for their ships , was the policy of European statesmen , and was pursued with the most selfish vigor . Petitions poured in upon Congress urging the imposition of discriminating duties that should encourage the production of needed things at home . The patriotism of the people , which no longer found afield of exercise in war , was energetically directed to the duty of equipping the young Republic for the defense of its independence by making its people self dependent . Societies for the promotion of home manufactures and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of the people were organized in many of the States . The revival at the end of the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation and development of domestic industries and the defense of our working people against injurious foreign competition is an incident worthy of attention . It is not a departure but a return that we have witnessed . The protective policy had then its opponents . The argument was made , as now , that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections . If the question became in any sense or at any time sectional , it was only because slavery existed in some of the States . But for this there was no reason why the cotton producing States should not have led or walked abreast with the New England States in the production of cotton fabrics . There was this reason only why the States that divide with Pennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern and central mountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to the smelting furnace and to the mill the coal and iron from their near opposing hillsides . Mill fires were lighted at the funeral pile of slavery . The emancipation proclamation was heard in the depths of the earth as well as in the sky men were made free , and material things became our better servants . The sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff discussion . We have no longer States that are necessarily only planting States . None are excluded from achieving that diversification of pursuits among the people which brings wealth and contentment . The cotton plantation will not be less valuable when the product is spun in the country town by operatives whose necessities call for diversified crops and create a home demand for garden and agricultural products . Every new mine , furnace , and factory is an extension of the productive capacity of the State more real and valuable than added territory . Shall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang upon the skirts of progress How long will those who rejoice that slavery no longer exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it put upon their communities I look hopefully to the continuance of our protective system and to the consequent development of manufacturing and mining enterprises in the States hitherto wholly given to agriculture as a potent influence in the perfect unification of our people . The men who have invested their capital in these enterprises , the farmers who have felt the benefit of their neighborhood , and the men who work in shop or field will not fail to find and to defend a community of interest . Is it not quite possible that the farmers and the promoters of the great mining and manufacturing enterprises which have recently been established in the South may yet find that the free ballot of the workingman , without distinction of race , is needed for their defense as well as for his own I do not doubt that if those men in the South who now accept the tariff views of Clay and the constitutional expositions of Webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions they would not find it difficult , by friendly instruction and cooperation , to make the black man their efficient and safe ally , not only in establishing correct principles in our national administration , but in preserving for their local communities the benefits of social order and economical and honest government . At least until the good offices of kindness and education have been fairly tried the contrary conclusion can not be plausibly urged . I have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special Executive policy for any section of our country . It is the duty of the Executive to administer and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities pointed out and provided by the Constitution all the laws enacted by Congress . These laws are general and their administration should be uniform and equal . As a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey , neither may the Executive eject which he will enforce . The duty to obey and to execute embraces the Constitution in its entirety and the whole code of laws enacted under it . The evil example of permitting individuals , corporations , or communities to nullify the laws because they cross some selfish or local interest or prejudices is full of danger , not only to the nation at large , but much more to those who use this pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain an unjust advantage over others . They will presently themselves be compelled to appeal to the law for protection , and those who would use the law as a defense must not deny that use of it to others . If our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal limitations and duties , they would have less cause to complain of the unlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference with their operations . The community that by concert , open or secret , among its citizens denies to a portion of its members their plain rights under the law has severed the only safe bond of social order and prosperity . The evil works from a bad center both ways . It demoralizes those who practice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector . The man in whose breast that faith has been darkened is naturally the subject of dangerous and uncanny suggestions . Those who use unlawful methods , if moved by no higher motive than the selfishness that prompted them , may well stop and inquire what is to be the end of this . An unlawful expedient can not become a permanent condition of government . If the educated and influential classes in a community either practice or connive at the systematic violation of laws that seem to them to cross their convenience , what can they expect when the lesson that convenience or a supposed class interest is a sufficient cause for lawlessness has been well learned by the ignorant classes A community where law is the rule of conduct and where courts , not mobs , execute its penalties is the only attractive field for business investments and honest labor . Our naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry into the character and good disposition of persons applying for citizenship more careful and searching . Our existing laws have been in their administration an unimpressive and often an unintelligible form . We accept the man as a citizen without any knowledge of his fitness , and he assumes the duties of citizenship without any knowledge as to what they are . The privileges of American citizenship are so great and its duties so grave that we may well insist upon a good knowledge of every person applying for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of our institutions . We should not cease to be hospitable to immigration , but we should cease to be careless as to the character of it . There are men of all races , even the best , whose coming is necessarily a burden upon our public revenues or a threat to social order . These should be identified and excluded . We have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference with European affairs . We have been only interested spectators of their contentions in diplomacy and in war , ready to use our friendly offices to promote peace , but never obtruding our advice and never attempting unfairly to coin the distresses of other powers into commercial advantage to ourselves . We have a just right to expect that our European policy will be the American policy of European courts . It is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our peace and safety which all the great powers habitually observe and enforce in matters affecting them that a shorter waterway between our eastern and western seaboards should be dominated by any European Government that we may confidently expect that such a purpose will not be entertained by any friendly power . We shall in the future , as in the past , use every endeavor to maintain and enlarge our friendly relations with all the great powers , but they will not expect us to look kindly upon any project that would leave us subject to the dangers of a hostile observation or environment . We have not sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker neighbors , but rather to aid and encourage them to establish free and stable governments resting upon the consent of their own people . We have a clear right to expect , therefore , that no European Government will seek to establish colonial dependencies upon the territory of these independent American States . That which a sense of justice restrains us from seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to forego . It must not be assumed , however , that our interests are so exclusively American that our entire inattention to any events that may transpire elsewhere can be taken for granted . Our citizens domiciled for purposes of trade in all countries and in many of the islands of the sea demand and will have our adequate care in their personal and commercial rights . The necessities of our Navy require convenient coaling stations and dock and harbor privileges . These and other trading privileges we will feel free to obtain only by means that do not in any degree partake of coercion , however feeble the government from which we ask such concessions . But having fairly obtained them by methods and for purposes entirely consistent with the most friendly disposition toward all other powers , our consent will be necessary to any modification or impairment of the concession . We shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation or the just rights of its citizens , nor to exact the like treatment for our own . Calmness , justice , and consideration should characterize our diplomacy . The offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly arbitration in proper cases should be adequate to the peaceful adjustment of all international difficulties . By such methods we will make our contribution to the world s peace , which no nation values more highly , and avoid the opprobrium which must fall upon the nation that ruthlessly breaks it . The duty devolved by law upon the President to nominate and , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to appoint all public officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the Constitution or by act of Congress has become very burdensome and its wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty . The civil list is so large that a personal knowledge of any large number of the applicants is impossible . The President must rely upon the representations of others , and these are often made inconsiderately and without any just sense of responsibility . I have a right , I think , to insist that those who volunteer or are invited to give advice as to appointments shall exercise consideration and fidelity . A high sense of duty and an ambition to improve the service should characterize all public officers . There are many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who have business with our public offices may be promoted by a thoughtful and obliging officer , and I shall expect those whom I may appoint to justify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of their duties . Honorable party service will certainly not be esteemed by me a disqualification for public office , but it will in no case be allowed to serve as a shield of official negligence , incompetency , or delinquency . It is entirely creditable to seek public office by proper methods and with proper motives , and all applicants will be treated with consideration but I shall need , and the heads of Departments will need , time for inquiry and deliberation . Persistent importunity will not , therefore , be the best support of an application for office . Heads of Departments , bureaus , and all other public officers having any duty connected therewith will be expected to enforce the civil service law fully and without evasion . Beyond this obvious duty I hope to do something more to advance the reform of the civil service . The ideal , or even my own ideal , I shall probably not attain . Retrospect will be a safer basis of judgment than promises . We shall not , however , I am sure , be able to put our civil service upon a nonpartisan basis until we have secured an incumbency that fair minded men of the opposition will approve for impartiality and integrity . As the number of such in the civil list is increased removals from office will diminish . While a Treasury surplus is not the greatest evil , it is a serious evil . Our revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demands upon our Treasury , with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary but scarcely less imperative demands which arise now and then . Expenditure should always be made with economy and only upon public necessity . Wastefulness , profligacy , or favoritism in public expenditures is criminal . But there is nothing in the condition of our country or of our people to suggest that anything presently necessary to the public prosperity , security , or honor should be unduly postponed . It will be the duty of Congress wisely to forecast and estimate these extraordinary demands , and , having added them to our ordinary expenditures , to so adjust our revenue laws that no considerable annual surplus will remain . We will fortunately be able to apply to the redemption of the public debt any small and unforeseen excess of revenue . This is better than to reduce our income below our necessary expenditures , with the resulting choice between another change of our revenue laws and an increase of the public debt . It is quite possible , I am sure , to effect the necessary reduction in our revenues without breaking down our protective tariff or seriously injuring any domestic industry . The construction of a sufficient number of modern war ships and of their necessary armament should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection in plans and workmanship . The spirit , courage , and skill of our naval officers and seamen have many times in our history given to weak ships and inefficient guns a rating greatly beyond that of the naval list . That they will again do so upon occasion I do not doubt but they ought not , by premeditation or neglect , to be left to the risks and exigencies of an unequal combat . We should encourage the establishment of American steamship lines . The exchanges of commerce demand stated , reliable , and rapid means of communication , and until these are provided the development of our trade with the States lying south of us is impossible . Our pension laws should give more adequate and discriminating relief to the Union soldiers and sailors and to their widows and orphans . Such occasions as this should remind us that we owe everything to their valor and sacrifice . It is a subject of congratulation that there is a near prospect of the admission into the Union of the Dakotas and Montana and Washington Territories . This act of justice has been unreasonably delayed in the case of some of them . The people who have settled these Territories are intelligent , enterprising , and patriotic , and the accession these new States will add strength to the nation . It is due to the settlers in the Territories who have availed themselves of the invitations of our land laws to make homes upon the public domain that their titles should be speedily adjusted and their honest entries confirmed by patent . It is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being manifested in the reform of our election laws . Those who have been for years calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the ballot box and about the elector further safeguards , in order that our elections might not only be free and pure , but might clearly appear to be so , will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover the need of reform . The National Congress has not as yet taken control of elections in that case over which the Constitution gives it jurisdiction , but has accepted and adopted the election laws of the several States , provided penalties for their violation and a method of supervision . Only the inefficiency of the State laws or an unfair partisan administration of them could suggest a departure from this policy . It was clearly , however , in the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution that such an exigency might arise , and provision was wisely made for it . The freedom of the ballot is a condition of our national life , and no power vested in Congress or in the Executive to secure or perpetuate it should remain unused upon occasion . The people of all the Congressional districts have an equal interest that the election in each shall truly express the views and wishes of a majority of the qualified electors residing within it . The results of such elections are not local , and the insistence of electors residing in other districts that they shall be pure and free does not savor at all of impertinence . If in any of the States the public security is thought to be threatened by ignorance among the electors , the obvious remedy is education . The sympathy and help of our people will not be withheld from any community struggling with special embarrassments or difficulties connected with the suffrage if the remedies proposed proceed upon lawful lines and are promoted by just and honorable methods . How shall those who practice election frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship The man who has come to regard the ballot box as a juggler s hat has renounced his allegiance . Let us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions . Let those who would die for the flag on the field of battle give a better proof of their patriotism and a higher glory to their country by promoting fraternity and justice . A party success that is achieved by unfair methods or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful and evanescent even from a party standpoint . We should hold our differing opinions in mutual respect , and , having submitted them to the arbitrament of the ballot , should accept an adverse judgment with the same respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the decision had been in our favor . No other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love or a land so magnificent in extent , so pleasant to look upon , and so full of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor . God has placed upon our head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond definition or calculation . But we must not forget that we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins of power and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the people . I do not mistrust the future . Dangers have been in frequent ambush along our path , but we have uncovered and vanquished them all . Passion has swept some of our communities , but only to give us a new demonstration that the great body of our people are stable , patriotic , and law abiding . No political party can long pursue advantage at the expense of public honor or by rude and indecent methods without protest and fatal disaffection in its own body . The peaceful agencies of commerce are more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our communities , and the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting mutual respect . We shall find unalloyed pleasure in the revelation which our next census will make of the swift development of the great resources of some of the States . Each State will bring its generous contribution to the great aggregate of the nation s increase . And when the harvests from the fields , the cattle from the hills , and the ores of the earth shall have been weighed , counted , and valued , we will turn from them all to crown with the highest honor the State that has most promoted education , virtue , justice , and patriotism among its people .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives In my annual message delivered to Congress at the beginning of the present session , after a brief statement of the facts then in the possession of this Government touching the assault in the streets of Valparaiso , Chile , upon the sailors of the United States steamship Baltimore on the evening of the 16th of October last , I said This Government is now awaiting the result of an investigation which has been conducted by the criminal court at Valparaiso . It is reported unofficially that the Investigation is about completed , and it is expected that the result will soon be communicated to this Government , together with some adequate and satisfactory response to the note by which the attention of Chile was called to this incident . If these just expectations should be disappointed or further needless delay intervene , I will by a special message bring this matter again to the attention of Congress for such action as may be necessary . In my opinion the time has now come when I should lay before the Congress and the country the correspondence between this Government and the Government of Chile from the time of the breaking out of the revolution against Balmaceda , together with all other facts in the possession of the executive department relating to this matter . The diplomatic correspondence is herewith transmitted , together with some correspondence between the naval officers for the time in command in Chilean waters and the Secretary of the Navy , and also the evidence taken at the Mare Island Navy Yard since the arrival of the Baltimore at San Francisco . I do not deem it necessary in this communication to attempt any full analysis of the correspondence or of the evidence . A brief restatement of the international questions involved and of the reasons why the responses of the Chilean Government are unsatisfactory is all that I deem necessary . It may be well at the outset to say that whatever may have been said in this country or in Chile in criticism of Egan , our minister at Santiago , the true history of this exciting period in Chilean affairs from the outbreak of the revolution until this time discloses no act on the part of Egan unworthy of his position or that could justly be the occasion of serious animadversion or criticism . He has , I think , on the whole borne himself in very trying circumstances with dignity , discretion , and courage , and has conducted the correspondence with ability , courtesy , and fairness . It is worth while also at the beginning to say that the right of Egan to give shelter in the legation to certain adherents of the Balmaceda Government who applied to him for asylum has not been denied by the Chilean authorities , nor has any demand been made for the surrender of these refugees . That there was urgent need of asylum is shown by Egan 39 s note of August 24 , 1891 , describing the disorders that prevailed in Santiago , and by the evidence of Captain Schley as to the pillage and violence that prevailed at Valparaiso . The correspondence discloses , however , that the request of Egan for a safe conduct from the country in behalf of these refugees was denied . The precedents cited by him in the correspondence , particularly the case of the revolution in Peru in 1865 , did not leave the Chilean Government in a position to deny the right of asylum to political refugees , and seemed very clearly to support Egan 39 s contention that a safe conduct to neutral territory was a necessary and acknowledged incident of the asylum . These refugees have very recently , without formal safe conduct , but by the acquiescence of the Chilean authorities , been placed on board the Yorktown , and are now being conveyed to Callao , Peru . This incident might be considered wholly closed but for the disrespect manifested toward this Government by the close and offensive police surveillance of the legation premises which was maintained during most of the period of the stay of the refugees therein . After the date of my annual message , and up to the time of the transfer of the refugees to the Yorktown , the legation premises seemed to have been surrounded by police in uniform and police agents or detectives in citizen 39 s dress , who offensively scrutinized persons entering or leaving the legation , and on one or more occasions arrested members of the minister 39 s family . Commander Evans , who by my direction recently visited Egan at Santiago , in his telegram to the Navy Department described the legation as a veritable prison , and states that the police agents or detectives were after his arrival withdrawn during his stay . It appears further from the note of Egan of November 20 , 1891 , that on one occasion at least these police agents , whom he declares to be known to him , invaded the legation premises , pounding upon its windows and using insulting and threatening language toward persons therein . This breach of the right of a minister to freedom from police espionage and restraint seems to have been so flagrant that the Argentine minister , who was dean of the diplomatic corps , having observed it , felt called upon to protest against it to the Chilean minister of foreign affairs . The Chilean authorities have , as will be observed from the correspondence , charged the refugees and the inmates of the legation with insulting the police but it seems to me incredible that men whose lives were in jeopardy and whose safety could only be secured by retirement and quietness should have sought to provoke a collision , which could only end in their destruction , or to aggravate their condition by intensifying a popular feeling that at one time so threatened the legation as to require Egan to appeal to the minister of foreign affairs . But the most serious incident disclosed by the correspondence is that of the attack upon the sailors of the Baltimore in the streets of Valparaiso on the 16th of October last . In my annual message , speaking upon the information then in my possession , I said So far as I have yet been able to learn , no other explanation of this bloody work has been suggested than that it had its origin in hostility to those men as sailors of the United States , wearing the uniform of their Government , and not in any individual act or personal animosity . We have now received from the Chilean Government an abstract of the conclusions of the fiscal general upon the testimony taken by the judge of crimes in an investigation which was made to extend over nearly three months . I very much regret to be compelled to say that this report does not enable me to modify the conclusion announced in my annual message . I am still of the opinion that our sailors were assaulted , beaten , stabbed , and killed not for anything they or any one of them had done , but for what the Government of the United States had done or was charged with having done by its civil officers and naval commanders . If that be the true aspect of the case , the injury was to the Government of the United States , not to these poor sailors who were assaulted in a manner so brutal and so cowardly . Before attempting to give an outline of the facts upon which this conclusion rests I think it right to say a word or two upon the legal aspect of the case . The Baltimore was in the harbor of Valparaiso by virtue of that general invitation which nations are held to extend to the war vessels of other powers with which they have friendly relations . This invitation , I think , must be held ordinarily to embrace the privilege of such communication with the shore as is reasonable , necessary , and proper for the comfort and convenience of the officers and men of such vessels . Captain Schley testifies that when his vessel returned to Valparaiso on September 14 the city officers , as is customary , extended the hospitalities of the city to his officers and crew . It is not claimed that every personal collision or injury in which a sailor or officer of such naval vessel visiting the shore may be involved raises an international question , but I am clearly of the opinion that where such sailors or officers are assaulted by a resident populace , animated by hostility to the government whose uniform these sailors and officers wear and in resentment of acts done by their government , not by them , their nation must take notice of the event as one involving an infraction of its rights and dignity , not in a secondary way , as where a citizen is injured and presents his claim through his own government , but in a primary way , precisely as if its minister or consul or the flag itself had been the object of the same character of assault . The officers and sailors of the Baltimore were in the harbor of Valparaiso under the orders of their Government , not by their own choice . They were upon the shore by the implied invitation of the Government of Chile and with the approval of their commanding officer and it does not distinguish their case from that of a consul that his stay is more permanent or that he holds the express invitation of the local government to justify his longer residence . Nor does it affect the question that the injury was the act of a mob . If there had been no participation by the police or military in this cruel work and no neglect on their part to extend protection , the case would still be one , in my opinion , when its extent and character are considered , involving international rights . The incidents of the affair are briefly as follows On the 16th of October last Captain Schley , commanding the United States steamship Baltimore , gave shore leave to 117 petty officers and sailors of his ship . These men left the ship about 1 . 30 p . m . No incident of violence occurred , none of our men were arrested , no complaint was lodged against them , nor did any collision or outbreak occur until about 6 o 39 clock p . m . Captain Schley states that he was himself on shore and about the streets of the city until 5 . 30 p . m . that he met very many of his men who were upon leave that they were sober and were conducting themselves with propriety , saluting Chilean and other officers as they met them . Other officers of the ship and Captain Jenkins , of the merchant ship Keweenaw , corroborate Captain Schley as to the general sobriety and good behavior of our men . The Sisters of Charity at the hospital to which our wounded men were taken when inquired of stated that they were sober when received . If the situation had been otherwise , we must believe that the Chilean police authorities would have made arrests . About 6 p . m . the assault began , and it is remarkable that the investigation by the judge of crimes , though so protracted , does not enable him to give any more satisfactory account of its origin than is found in the statement that it began between drunken sailors . Repeatedly in the correspondence it is asserted that it was impossible to learn the precise cause of the riot . The minister of foreign affairs , Matta , in his telegram to Montt under date December 31 , states that the quarrel began between two sailors in a tavern and was continued in the street , persons who were passing joining in it . The testimony of Talbot , an apprentice , who was with Riggin , is that the outbreak in which they were involved began by a Chilean sailor 39 s spitting in the face of Talbot , which was resented by a knockdown . It appears that Riggin and Talbot were at the time unaccompanied by others of their shipmates . These two men were immediately beset by a crowd of Chilean citizens and sailors , through which they broke their way to a street car , and entered it for safety . They were pursued , driven from the car , and Riggin was so seriously beaten that he fell in the street apparently dead . There is nothing in the report of the Chilean investigation made to us that seriously impeaches this testimony . It appears from Chilean sources that almost instantly , with a suddenness that strongly implies meditation and preparation , a mob , stated by the police authorities at one time to number 2 , 000 and at another 1 , 000 , was engaged in the assault upon our sailors , who are represented as resisting with stones , clubs , and bright arms . The report of the intendente of October 30 states that the fight began at 6 p . m . in three streets , which are named that information was received at the intendencia at 6 . 15 , and that the police arrived on the scene at 6 . 30 , a full half hour after the assault began . At that time he says that a mob of 2 , 000 men had collected , and that for several squares there was the appearance of a real battlefield . The scene at this point is very graphically set before us by the Chilean testimony . The American sailors , who after so long an examination have not been found guilty of any breach of the peace so far as the Chilean authorities are able to discover , unarmed and defenseless , are fleeing for their lives , pursued by overwhelming numbers , and fighting only to aid their own escape from death or to succor some mate whose life is in greater peril . Eighteen of them are brutally stabbed and beaten , while one Chilean seems from the report to have suffered some injury , but how serious or with what character of weapon , or whether by a missile thrown by our men or by some of his fellow rioters , is unascertained . The pretense that our men were fighting with stones , clubs , and bright arms is in view of these facts incredible . It is further refuted by the fact that our prisoners when searched were absolutely without arms , only seven penknives being found in the possession of the men arrested , while there were received by our men more than thirty stab wounds , every one of which was inflicted in the back , and almost every confused wound was in the back or back of the head . The evidence of the ship 39 s officer of the day is that even the jackknives of the men were taken from them before leaving the ship . As to the brutal nature of the treatment received by our men , the following extract from the account given of the affair by the La Patria newspaper , of Valparaiso , of October 17 , can not be regarded as too friendly The Yankees , as soon as their pursuers gave chase , went by way of the Calle del Arsenal toward the city car station . In the presence of an ordinary number of citizens , among whom were some sailors , the North Americans took seats in the street car to escape from the stones which the Chileans threw at them . It was believed for an instant that the North Americans had saved themselves from popular fury , but such was not the case . Scarcely had the car begun to move when a crowd gathered around and stopped its progress . Under these circumstances and without any cessation of the howling and throwing of stones at the North Americans , the conductor entered the car , and , seeing the risk of the situation to the vehicle , ordered them to get out . At the instant the sailors left the car , in the midst of a hail of stones , the said conductor received a stone blow on the head . One of the Yankee sailors managed to escape in the direction of the Plaza Wheelright , but the other was felled to the ground by a stone . Managing to raise himself from the ground where he lay , he staggered in an opposite direction from the station . In front of the house of Senor Mazzini he was again wounded , falling then senseless and breathless . No amount of evasion or subterfuge is able to cloud our clear vision of this brutal work . It should be noticed in this connection that the American sailors arrested , after an examination , were during the four days following the arrest every one discharged , no charge of any breach of the peace or other criminal conduct having been sustained against a single one of them . The judge of crimes , Foster , in a note to the intendente under date of October 22 , before the dispatch from this Government of the following day , which aroused the authorities of Chile to a better sense of the gravity of the affair , says Having presided temporarily over this court in regard to the seamen of the United States cruiser Baltimore , who have been tried on account of the deplorable conduct which took place , etc . The noticeable point here is that our sailors had been tried before the 22d of October , and that the trial resulted in their acquittal and return to their vessel It is quite remarkable and quite characteristic of the management of this affair by the Chilean police authorities that we should now be advised that Seaman Davidson , of the Baltimore , has been included in the indictment , his offense being , so far as I have been able to ascertain , that he attempted to defend a shipmate against an assailant who was striking at him with a knife . The perfect vindication of our men is furnished by this report . One only is found to have been guilty of criminal fault , and that for an act clearly justifiable . As to the part taken by the police in the affair , the case made by Chile is also far from satisfactory . The point where Riggin was killed is only three minutes 39 walk from the police station , and not more than twice that distance from the intendencia and yet according to their official report a full half hour elapsed after the assault began before the police were upon the ground . It has been stated that all but two of our men have said that the police did their duty . The evidence taken at Mare Island shows that if such a statement was procured from our men it was accomplished by requiring them to sign a writing in a language they did not understand and by the representation that it was a mere declaration that they had taken no part in the disturbance . Lieutenant McCrea , who acted as interpreter , says in his evidence that when our sailors were examined before the court the subject of the conduct of the police was so carefully avoided that he reported the fact to Captain Schley on his return to the vessel . The evidences of the existence of animosity toward our sailors in the minds of the sailors of the Chilean navy and of the populace of Valparaiso are so abundant and various as to leave no doubt in the mind of anyone who will examine the papers submitted . It manifested itself in threatening and insulting gestures toward our men as they passed the Chilean men of war in their boats and in the derisive and abusive epithets with which they greeted every appearance of an American sailor on the evening of the riot . Captain Schley reports that boats from the Chilean war ships several times went out of their course to cross the bows of his boats , compelling them to back water . He complained of the discourtesy , and it was corrected . That this feeling was shared by men of higher rank is shown by an incident related by Surgeon Stitt , of the Baltimore . After the battle of Placilla he , with other medical officers of the war vessels in the harbor , was giving voluntary assistance to the wounded in the hospitals . The son of a Chilean army officer of high rank was under his care , and when the father discovered it he flew into a passion and said he would rather have his son die than have Americans touch him , and at once had him removed from the ward . This feeling is not well concealed in the dispatches of the foreign office , and had quite open expression in the disrespectful treatment of the American legation . The Chilean boatmen in the bay refused , even for large offers of money , to return our sailors , who crowded the Mole , to their ship when they were endeavoring to escape from the city on the night of the assault . The market boats of the Baltimore were threatened , and even quite recently the gig of Commander Evans , of the Yorktown , was stoned while waiting for him at the Mole . The evidence of our sailors clearly shows that the attack was expected by the Chilean people , that threats had been made against our men , and that in one case , somewhat early in the afternoon , the keeper of one house into which some of our men had gone closed his establishment in anticipation of the attack , which he advised them would be made upon them as darkness came on . In a report of Captain Schley to the Navy Department he says In the only interview that I had with Judge Foster , who is investigating the case relative to the disturbance , before he was aware of the entire gravity of the matter , he informed me that the assault upon my men was the outcome of hatred for our people among the lower classes because they thought we had sympathized with the Balmaceda Government on account of the Itata matter , whether with reason or without he could of course not admit but such he thought was the explanation of the assault at that time . Several of our men sought security from the mob by such complete or partial changes in their dress as would conceal the fact of their being seamen of the Baltimore , and found it then possible to walk the streets without molestation . These incidents conclusively establish that the attack was upon the uniform the nationality and not upon the men . The origin of this feeling is probably found in the refusal of this Government to give recognition to the Congressional party before it had established itself , in the seizure of the Itala for an alleged violation of the neutrality law , in the cable incident , and in the charge that Admiral Brown conveyed information to Valparaiso of the landing at Quinteros . It is not my purpose to enter here any defense of the action of this Government in these matters . It is enough for the present purpose to say that if there was any breach of international comity or duty on our part it should have been made the subject of official complaint through diplomatic channels or for reprisals for which a full responsibility was assumed . We can not consent that these incidents and these perversions of the truth shall be used to excite a murderous attack upon our unoffending sailors and the Government of Chile go acquit of responsibility . In fact , the conduct of this Government during the war in Chile pursued those lines of international duty which we had so strongly insisted upon on the part of other nations when this country was in the throes of a civil conflict . We continued the established diplomatic relations with the government in power until it was overthrown , and promptly and cordially recognized the new government when it was established . The good offices of this Government were offered to bring about a peaceful adjustment , and the interposition of Egan to mitigate severities and to shelter adherents of the Congressional party was effective and frequent . The charge against Admiral Brown is too base to gain credence with anyone who knows his high personal and professional character . Recurring to the evidence of our sailors , I think it is shown that there were several distinct assaults , and so nearly simultaneous as to show that they did not spread from one point . A press summary of the report of the fiscal shows that the evidence of the Chilean officials and others was in conflict as to the place of origin , several places being named by different witnesses as the locality where the first outbreak occurred . This if correctly reported shows that there were several distinct outbreaks , and so nearly at the same time as to cause this confusion . The La Patria , in the same issue from which I have already quoted , after describing the killing of Riggin and the fight which from that point extended to the Mole , says At the same time in other streets of the port the Yankee sailors fought fiercely with the people of the town , who believed to see in them incarnate enemies of the Chilean navy . The testimony of Captain Jenkins , of the American merchant ship Keweenaw , which had gone to Valparaiso for repairs , and who was a witness of some part of the assault upon the crew of the Baltimore , is strongly corroborative of the testimony of our own sailors when he says that he saw Chilean sentries drive back a seaman seeking shelter upon a mob that was pursuing him . The officers and men of Captain Jenkins 39 s ship furnish the most conclusive testimony as to the indignities which were practiced toward Americans in Valparaiso . When American sailors , even of merchant ships , can only secure their safety by denying their nationality , it must be time to readjust our relations with a government that permits such demonstrations . As to the participation of the police , the evidence of our sailors shows that our men were struck and beaten by police officers before and after arrest , and that one at least was dragged with a lasso about his neck by a mounted policeman . That the death of Riggin was the result of a rifle shot fired by a policeman or soldier on duty is shown directly by the testimony of Johnson , in whose arms he was at the time , and by the evidence of Charles Langen , an American sailor , not then a member of the Baltimore 39 s crew , who stood close by and saw the transaction . The Chilean authorities do not pretend to fix the responsibility of this shot upon any particular person , but avow their inability to ascertain who fired it further than that it was fired from a crowd . The character of the wound as described by one of the surgeons of the Baltimore clearly supports his opinion that it was made by a rifle ball , the orifice of exit being as much as an inch or an inch and a quarter in width . When shot the poor fellow was unconscious and in the arms of a comrade , who was endeavoring to carry him to a neighboring drug store for treatment . The story of the police that in coming up the street they passed these men and left them behind them is inconsistent with their own statement as to the direction of their approach and with their duty to protect them , and is clearly disproved . In fact Riggin was not behind but in front of the advancing force , and was not standing in the crowd , but was unconscious and supported in the arms of Johnson when he was shot . The communications of the Chilean Government in relation to this cruel and disastrous attack upon our men , as will appear from the correspondence , have not in any degree taken the form of a manly and satisfactory expression of regret , much less of apology . The event was of so serious a character that if the injuries suffered by our men had been wholly the result of an accident in a Chilean port the incident was grave enough to have called for some public expression of sympathy and regret from the local authorities . It is not enough to say that the affair was lamentable , for humanity would require that expression even if the beating and killing of our men had been justifiable . It is not enough to say that the incident is regretted , coupled with the statement that the affair was not of an unusual character in ports where foreign sailors are accustomed to meet . It is not for a generous and sincere government to seek for words of small or equivocal meaning in which to convey to a friendly power an apology for an offense so atrocious as this . In the case of the assault by a mob in New Orleans upon the Spanish consulate in 1851 , Webster wrote to the Spanish minister , Calderon , that the acts complained of were a disgraceful and flagrant breach of duty and propriety , and that his Government regrets them as deeply as Minister Calderon or his Government could possibly do that these acts have caused the President great pain , and he thinks a proper acknowledgment is due to Her Majesty 39 s Government . He invited the Spanish consul to return to his post , guaranteeing protection , and offered to salute the Spanish flag if the consul should come in a Spanish vessel . Such a treatment by the Government of Chile of this assault would have been more creditable to the Chilean authorities , and much less can hardly be satisfactory to a government that values its dignity and honor . In our note of October 23 last , which appears in the correspondence , after receiving the report of the board of officers appointed by Captain Schley to investigate the affair , the Chilean Government was advised of the aspect which it then assumed and called upon for any facts in its possession that might tend to modify the unfavorable impressions which our report had created . It is very clear from the correspondence that before the receipt of this note the examination was regarded by the police authorities as practically closed . It was , however , reopened and protracted through a period of nearly three months . We might justly have complained of this unreasonable delay but in view of the fact that the Government of Chile was still provisional , and with a disposition to be forbearing and hopeful of a friendly termination , I have awaited the report , which has but recently been made . On the 21st instant I caused to be communicated to the Government of Chile by the American minister at Santiago the conclusions of this Government after a full consideration of all the evidence and of every suggestion affecting this matter , and to these conclusions I adhere . They were stated as follows First . That the assault is not relieved of the aspect which the early information of the event gave to it , viz , that of an attack upon the uniform of the United States Navy having its origin and motive in a feeling of hostility to this Government , and not in any act of the sailors or of any of them . Second . That the public authorities of Valparaiso flagrantly failed in their duty to protect our men , and that some of the police and of the Chilean soldiers and sailors were themselves guilty of unprovoked assaults upon our sailors before and after arrest . He the President thinks the preponderance of the evidence and the inherent probabilities lead to the conclusion that Riggin was killed by the police or soldiers . Third . That he the President is therefore compelled to bring the case back to the position taken by this Government in the note of Wharton of October 23 last and to ask for a suitable apology and for some adequate reparation for the injury done to this Government . In the same note the attention of the Chilean Government was called to the offensive character of a note addressed by Matta , its minister of foreign affairs , to Montt , its minister at this capital , on the 11th ultimo . This dispatch was not officially communicated to this Government , but as Montt was directed to translate it and to give it to the press of the country it seemed to me that it could not pass without official notice . It was not only undiplomatic , but grossly insulting to our naval officers and to the executive department , as it directly imputed untruth and insincerity to the reports of the naval officers and to the official communications made by the executive department to Congress . It will be observed that I have notified the Chilean Government that unless this note is at once withdrawn and an apology as public as the offense made I will terminate diplomatic relations . The request for the recall of Egan upon the ground that he was not persona grata was unaccompanied by any suggestion that could properly be used in support of it , and I infer that the request is based upon official acts of Egan which have received the approval of this Government . But however that may be , I could not consent to consider such a question until it had first been settled whether our correspondence with Chile could be conducted upon a basis of mutual respect . In submitting these papers to Congress for that grave and patriotic consideration which the questions involved demand I desire to say that I am of the opinion that the demands made of Chile by this Government should be adhered to and enforced . If the dignity as well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to be wholly sacrificed , we must protect those who in foreign ports display the flag or wear the colors of this Government against insult , brutality , and death inflicted in resentment of the acts of their Government and not for any fault of their own . It has been my desire in every way to cultivate friendly and intimate relations with all the Governments of this hemisphere . We do not covet their territory . We desire their peace and prosperity . We look for no advantage in our relations with them except the increased exchanges of commerce upon a basis of mutual benefit . We regret every civil contest that disturbs their peace and paralyzes their development , and are always ready to give our good offices for the restoration of peace . It must , however , be understood that this Government , while exercising the utmost forbearance toward weaker powers , will extend its strong and adequate protection to its citizens , to its officers , and to its humblest sailor when made the victims of wantonness and cruelty in resentment not of their personal misconduct , but of the official acts of their Government . Upon information received that Patrick Shields , an Irishman and probably a British subject , but at the time a fireman of the American steamer Keweenaw , in the harbor of Valparaiso for repairs , had been subjected to personal injuries in that city , largely by the police , I directed the Attorney General to cause the evidence of the officers and crew of that vessel to be taken upon its arrival in San Francisco , and that testimony is also herewith transmitted . The brutality and even savagery of the treatment of this poor man by the Chilean police would be incredible if the evidence of Shields was not supported by other direct testimony and by the distressing condition of the man himself when he was finally able to reach his vessel . The captain of the vessel says He came back a wreck , black from his neck to his hips from beating , weak and stupid , and is still in a kind of paralyzed condition , and has never been able to do duty since . A claim for reparation has been made in behalf of this man , for while he was not a citizen of the United States , the doctrine long held by us , as expressed in the consular regulations , is The principles which are maintained by this Government in regard to the protection , as distinguished from the relief , of seamen are well settled . It is held that the circumstance that the vessel is American is evidence that the seamen on board are such , and in every regularly documented merchant vessel the crew will find their protection in the flag that covers them . I have as yet received no reply to our note of the 21st instant , but in my opinion I ought not to delay longer to bring these matters to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed appropriate<speech_sep>
