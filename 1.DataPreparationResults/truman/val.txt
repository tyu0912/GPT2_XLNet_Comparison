It certainly is a pleasure . This is the first Missouri town at which we have stopped since we left Washington , and I certainly was highly pleased when the next Governor of Missouri met me in Des Moines this morning and spent the day with me . We went to that great meeting outside of Des Moines , and he has been with me ever since . I told him that at the first stop in Missouri he was going to have to present the President of the United States , although so far as Missouri was concerned , they did not need such a presentation . Forrest Smith and I are going to carry this State , and so is every other Democrat on the ticket . I have got a lot of friends here in Trenton . I have been here many a time . When I was a kid , I had a job in the National Bank of Commerce in Kansas City , and I was getting 35 a month , and I had an old lady who ran a boarding house out on 1314 Troost , and she let me live there and have two meals a day for 5 a week . Imagine that And she was a native of Trenton , Mo . That has been so long ago , I hate to remember just exactly how long it has been , but because that good old lady was so kind to me , I have always had a warm spot in my heart for this town , even if it does go Republican sometimes . I do not think you are going to do that next time . How about it I am not supposed to address or make a political speech in my home State at this time , but I sincerely hope that all of you will study the issues for what they are worth , and I sincerely hope that on election day you will not hesitate to go to the polls , because this Government of ours is made up of the people . Every one of you has a hand in this Government , and when you do not exercise that great privilege which our forefathers sought to give you , you are shirking your duty , and then if the Government goes wrong , there is nobody to blame but you . You know , in 1946 two thirds of you stayed at home and you have got the 80th Congress I say , next to one , the worst Congress the country has ever had for the welfare of the public . If you will study the record , I am sure you will come to the same conclusion that I have , although you are not as close to those things as I am . But your interests are involved in the results of this the action and nonaction of the 80th Congress . All of you in this good town depend either on some job or on the soil , and if you do your interests have been vitally affected by the actions of this do nothing 80th Republican Congress . Now you are going to have a chance to remedy that on November 2nd . You are going to have a chance to make Forrest Smith Governor of Missouri , and you are going to have a very , very great chance of keeping a Missourian in the White House for another 4 years . There is one thing I want to bring home to you . I am on a crusade for the welfare of the everyday man in the United States . I am not working for special privilege . I am not working for the speculators lobby . I am not working for the real estate lobby . I am not working for any special interests in the United States but the interests of the everyday man whose interest is my interest and that interest is your interest . You know , Lincoln said that the Lord certainly loved the common people or he would not have made so many of them . I think that is just as true as it can be . Now I want you , as citizens of the great State of mine , of which I am prouder than anything else , because I think it is the greatest State in the Union , and I cannot say that in California or New York or Pennsylvania , but I say it here . It is the only State in the Union around which you can put a fence and it will survive . It has got everything it needs . There is no other State in the Union that has that . I want every citizen of this great State to help me in that crusade , to keep the government of the people , by the people , and for the people . And if you will do that , this country will continue for another thousand years as the greatest country in the world .<speech_sep>Mayor La Guardia , ladies and gentlemen I am grateful for the magnificent reception which you have given me today in this great city of New York . I know that it is given me only as the representative of the gallant men and women of our naval forces , and on their behalf , as well as my own , I thank you . New York joins the rest of the Nation in paying honor and tribute to the four million fighting Americans of the Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard and to the ships which carried them to victory . On opposite sides of the world , across two oceans , our Navy opened a highway for the armies and air forces of the United States . They landed our gallant men , millions of them , on the beachheads of final triumph . Fighting from Murmansk , the English Channel and the Tyrrhenian Sea , to Midway , Guadalcanal , Leyte Gulf and Okinawa they won the greatest naval victories in history . Together with their brothers in arms in the Army and Air Force , and with the men of the Merchant Marine , they have helped to win for mankind all over the world a new opportunity to live in peace and dignity and we hope , in security . In the harbor and rivers of New York City and in other ports along the coasts and rivers of the country , ships of that mighty United States Navy are at anchor . I hope that you and the people everywhere will visit them and their crews , seeing for yourselves what your sons and daughters , your labor and your money , have fashioned into an invincible weapon of liberty . The fleet , on V J Day , consisted of 1200 warships , more than 50 , 000 supporting and landing craft , and over 40 , 000 navy planes . By that day , ours was a sea power never before equalled in the history of the world . There were great carrier task forces capable of tracking down and sinking the enemy s fleets , beating down his air power , and pouring destruction on his war making industries . There were submarines which roamed the seas , invading the enemy s own ports , and destroying his shipping in all the oceans . There were amphibious forces capable of landing soldiers on beaches from Normandy to the Philippines . There were great battleships and cruisers which swept the enemy ships from the seas and bombarded his shore defense almost at will . And history will never forget that great leader who , from his first day in office , fought to reestablish a strong American Navy who watched that Navy and all the other might of this Nation grow into an invincible force for victory who sought to make that force an instrument for a just and lasting peace and who gave his life in the effort Franklin Roosevelt . The roll call of the battles of this fleet reads like a sign post around the globe on the road to final victory North Africa , Sicily , Italy , Normandy , and Southern France the Coral Sea , Midway , Guadalcanal , and the Solomons Tarawa , Saipan , Guam , the Philippine Sea , Leyte Gulf Iwo Jima and Okinawa . Nothing which the enemy held on any coast was safe from its attack . Now we are in the process of demobilizing our naval force . We are laying up ships . We are breaking up aircraft squadrons . We are rolling up bases , and releasing officers and men . But when our demobilization is all finished as planned , the United States will still be the greatest naval power on earth . In addition to that naval power , we shall still have one of the most powerful air forces in the world . And just the other day , so that on short notice we could mobilize a powerful and well equipped land , sea , and air force , I asked the Congress to adopt universal training . Why do we seek to preserve this powerful Naval and Air Force , and establish this strong Army reserve Why do we need to do that We have assured the world time and again and I repeat it now that we do not seek for ourselves one inch of territory in any place in the world . Outside of the right to establish necessary bases for our own protection , we look for nothing which belongs to any other power . We do need this kind of armed might , however , for four principal tasks First , our Army , Navy , and Air Force , in collaboration with our allies , must enforce the terms of peace imposed upon our defeated enemies . Second , we must fulfill the military obligations which we are undertaking as a member of the United Nations Organization to support a lasting peace , by force if necessary . Third , we must cooperate with other American nations to preserve the territorial integrity and the political independence of the nations of the Western Hemisphere . Fourth , in this troubled and uncertain world , our military forces must be adequate to discharge the fundamental mission laid upon them by the Constitution of the United States to provide for the common defense of the United States . These four military tasks are directed not toward war not toward conquest but toward peace . We seek to use our military strength solely to preserve the peace of the world . For we now know that this is the only sure way to make our own freedom secure . That is the basis of the foreign policy of the people of the United States . The foreign policy of the United States is based firmly on fundamental principles of righteousness and justice . In carrying out those principles we shall firmly adhere to what we believe to be right and we shall not give our approval to any compromise with evil . But we know that we cannot attain perfection in this world overnight . We shall not let our search for perfection obstruct our steady progress toward international cooperation . We must be prepared to fulfill our responsibilities as best we can , within the framework of our fundamental principles , even though we recognize that we have to operate in an imperfect world . Let me restate the fundamentals of that foreign policy of the United States 1 . We seek no territorial expansion or selfish advantage . We have no plans for aggression against any other state , large or small . We have no objective which need clash with the peaceful aims of any other nation . 2 . We believe in the eventual return of sovereign rights and self government to all peoples who have been deprived of them by force . 3 . We shall approve no territorial changes in any friendly part of the world unless they accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people concerned . 4 . We believe that all peoples who are prepared for self government should be permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely expressed choice , without interference from any foreign source . That is true in Europe , in Asia , in Africa , as well as in the Western Hemisphere . 5 . By the combined and cooperative action of our war allies , we shall help the defeated enemy states establish peaceful democratic governments of their own free choice . And we shall try to attain a world in which Nazism , Fascism , and military aggression cannot exist . 6 . We shall refuse to recognize any government imposed upon any nation by the force of any foreign power . In some cases it may be impossible to prevent forceful imposition of such a government . But the United States will not recognize any such government . 7 . We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and equal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of rivers and waterways which pass through more than one country . 8 . We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the world . 9 . We believe that the sovereign states of the Western Hemisphere , without interference from outside the Western Hemisphere , must work together as good neighbors in the solution of their common problems . 10 . We believe that full economic collaboration between all nations , great and small , is essential to the improvement of living conditions all over the world , and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from want . 11 . We shall continue to strive to promote freedom of expression and freedom of religion throughout the peace loving areas of the world . 12 . We are convinced that the preservation of peace between nations requires a United Nations Organization composed of all the peace loving nations of the world who are willing jointly to use force if necessary to insure peace . Now , that is the foreign policy which guides the United States . That is the foreign policy with which it confidently faces the future . It may not be put into effect tomorrow or the next day . But nonetheless , it is our policy and we shall seek to achieve it . It may take a long time , but it is worth waiting for , and it is worth striving to attain . The Ten Commandments themselves have not yet been universally achieved over these thousands of years . Yet we struggle constantly to achieve them , and in many ways we come closer to them each year . Though we may meet setbacks from time to time , we shall not relent in our efforts to bring the Golden Rule into the international affairs of the world . We are now passing through a difficult phase of international relations . Unfortunately it has always been true after past wars , that the unity among allies , forged by their common peril , has tended to wear out as the danger passed . The world cannot afford any letdown in the united determination of the allies in this war to accomplish a lasting peace . The world cannot afford to let the cooperative spirit of the allies in this war disintegrate . The world simply cannot allow this to happen . The people in the United States , in Russia , and Britain , in France and China , in collaboration with all the other peace loving people , must take the course of current history into their own hands and mold it in a new direction the direction of continued cooperation . It was a common danger which united us before victory . Let it be a common hope which continues to draw us together in the years to come . The atomic bombs which fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki must be made a signal , not for the old process of falling apart but for a new era an era of ever closer unity and ever closer friendship among peaceful nations . Building a peace requires as much moral stamina as waging a war . Perhaps it requires even more , because it is so laborious and painstaking and undramatic . It requires undying patience and continuous application . But it can give us , if we stay with it , the greatest reward that there is in the whole field of human effort . Differences of the kind that exist today among nations that fought together so long and so valiantly for victory are not hopeless or irreconcilable . There are no conflicts of interest among the victorious powers so deeply rooted that they cannot be resolved . But their solution will require a combination of forbearance and firmness . It will require a steadfast adherence to the high principles which we have enunciated . It will also require a willingness to find a common ground as to the methods of applying those principles . Our American policy is a policy of friendly partnership with all peaceful nations , and of full support for the United Nations Organization . It is a policy that has the strong backing of the American people . It is a policy around which we can rally without fear or misgiving . The more widely and clearly that policy is understood abroad , the better and surer will be the peace . For our own part we must seek to understand the special problems of other nations . We must seek to understand their own legitimate urge toward security as they see it . The immediate , the greatest threat to us is the threat of disillusionment , the danger of insidious skepticism a loss of faith in the effectiveness of international cooperation . Such a loss of faith would be dangerous at any time . In an atomic age it would be nothing short of disastrous . There has been talk about the atomic bomb scrapping all navies , armies , and air forces . For the present , I think that such talk is 100 percent wrong . Today , control of the seas rests in the fleets of the United States and her allies . There is no substitute for them . We have learned the bitter lesson that the weakness of this great Republic invites men of ill will to shake the very foundations of civilization all over the world . And we had two concrete lessons in that . What the distant future of the atomic research will bring to the fleet which we honor today , no one can foretell . But the fundamental mission of the Navy has not changed . Control of our sea approaches and of the skies above them is still the key to our freedom and to our ability to help enforce the peace of the world . No enemy will ever strike us directly except across the sea . We cannot reach out to help stop and defeat an aggressor without crossing the sea . Therefore , the Navy , armed with whatever weapons science brings forth , is still dedicated to its historic task control of the ocean approaches to our country and of the skies above them . The atomic bomb does not alter the basic foreign policy of the United States . It makes the development and application of our policy more urgent than we could have dreamed 6 months ago . It means that we must be prepared to approach international problems with greater speed , with greater determination , with greater ingenuity , in order to meet a situation for which there is no precedent . We must find the answer to the problems created by the release of atomic energy we must find the answers to the many other problems of peace in partnership with all the peoples of the United Nations . For their stake in world peace is as great as our own . As I said in my message to the Congress , discussion of the atomic bomb with Great Britain and Canada and later with other nations cannot wait upon the formal organization of the United Nations . These discussions , looking toward a free exchange of fundamental scientific information , will be begun in the near future . But I emphasize again , as I have before , that these discussions will not be concerned with the processes of manufacturing the atomic bomb or any other instruments of war . In our possession of this weapon , as in our possession of other new weapons , there is no threat to any nation . The world , which has seen the United States in two great recent wars , knows that full well . The possession in our hands of this new power of destruction we regard as a sacred trust . Because of our love of peace , the thoughtful people of the world know that that trust will not be violated , that it will be faithfully executed . Indeed , the highest hope of the American people is that world cooperation for peace will soon reach such a state of perfection that atomic methods of destruction can be definitely and effectively outlawed forever . We have sought , and we will continue to seek , the attainment of that objective . We shall pursue that course with all the wisdom , patience , and determination that the God of Peace can bestow upon a people who are trying to follow in His path .<speech_sep>Murphy , distinguished guests , Mayor , delegates to the 29th Annual Convention of the Columbia Scholastic Press Association You know , I was very much afraid that you were going to take that admonition of Murphy seriously , but I am very glad that you did not when he told you not to make any noise after the broadcast went on . I am happy to be with you today . It is a pleasure to talk to the young people who run the school papers of this great country of ours . You probably do not know it , but I was a school editor myself once of the high school paper in Independence , Mo . And it was a first edition , too . Charlie Ross , and four or five other kids and myself got out the first number of The Gleam , named after the admonition in Tennyson s poem , After it , follow it , follow the gleam . I have been trying to follow it ever since . From then on I kept going , and you know the trouble that I am in today . So you see , if you are not very careful , you may end up by living in the White House , and I say to you that it is a wonderful experience indeed , in spite of all its troubles . All my life I have been interested in the Presidency , and the way Presidents are chosen . I remember very well the first presidential nominating convention that I attended . It was in Kansas City , Mo . , in 1900 , when Bryan was nominated the second time for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency . I was 16 , and I enjoyed that convention very much , because I thought old man Bryan was the greatest orator of the time . And I still think so . President Roosevelt said he was one of the great progressives of our times , but he was ahead of his time . A lot of us are in that condition . Now , besides being nominated for the Presidency three times , Bryan became an editor . And you know , I am very much interested in editors and publishers . It is a very great responsibility to be the editor of a great newspaper , or a great periodical . And we have some wonderfully great magazines and newspapers in this country . It is the duty of the editors of those great publications to see that the news is the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . And these great ones do just that . But we do have among us some publications which do not care very much for the truth in the news , and sometimes make propaganda out of it , and then write editorials about it . But an editorial written on misrepresentation in the news and on propaganda is just as bad as the foundation on which it rests . I hope that if any of you become editors of great publications and you are now editors of great publications in your sphere that you will stick strictly to the truth and nothing but the truth when you publish the news . I heard Bryan say one time that the first convention he attended was at Philadelphia in 1876 , and he crawled in through a window , and that ever since that time they had been trying to put him out over the transom but never had succeeded . The first convention that I attended was the one I referred to in 1900 , when I walked into that convention . I also later walked into the White House , which Bryan never did do . And I do not know who got the best of it , because Bryan got his message over just as well as if he had been elected President , and I do not know whether I am getting mine over or not . Another convention that I remember very well was the one at Baltimore when Woodrow Wilson was nominated . I was running a binder around a quarter section of land took 2 miles to make that circuit . And at one corner there was a little telegraph station about a quarter mile from where I was working , and I would get down and go over to the telegraph station to see how the convention was coming on . And that is how I found out that Woodrow Wilson had been nominated . Did not have any radio or television in those days , and we did not have any pollsters or false political prophets , either . I voted for Wilson that year , and I have believed ever since in the policies which he followed . He was one of our very greatest Presidents . And I sincerely believe that if we had followed him in what he wanted to do , we would certainly have avoided the Second World War . I hope that we will not make that same mistake after this last world war . Now I understand that a lot of people are mystified and wonder why I came all the way up here from Key West to talk to you today . The answer is very simple . I came because the future of this great Republic of ours depends upon young people like you , and also for the reason that for the last 7 years young people have been coming to see me at the White House . There is hardly a week goes by that I do not see some delegation of young people , who pass through my office and shake hands with me , and I usually have a word or two to say to them . And now I am here , and you are in exactly the same position you would be at the White House You would have to listen . The United States of America is the greatest Republic in the history of the world . We want to keep it the greatest Republic . It will be up to you young people to do that job in the future . Youth , the hope of the world . That was the motto on the front door of the high school from which I was graduated , only it was written in Latin , Juventus Spes Mundi . I will never forget it . I never have forgotten it , and I still think that youth is the hope of the world , and that they always will be . It is just as true now as it was when I came out of that small town high school . It is necessary for the young people to understand the road to be followed , if this country is to accomplish the mission which God intended it to accomplish in this world . I hope I can give you some idea of how to follow that road into tomorrow and the future of the world . I hope you will go back to your schools and talk about it and discuss it . I hope you will write about it in your publications , because it is your responsibility as editors to work for the good of your great country , and for the future of the world . Both are in your hands . Now , the thing I want to impress upon you is that government must be operated on the basis of the greatest good for the greatest number of its citizens . That is the fundamental basis of the domestic program and the foreign policy of this Government of yours and mine . No nation is good and can last unless it is built upon our ideals . Our Nation is built upon ideals ideals of unselfishness and respect for the rights and welfare of others . The fundamental basis of this Nation s ideals was given to Moses on Mount Sinai . The fundamental basis of the Bill of Rights of our Constitution comes from the teachings which we get from Exodus , Matthew , Isaiah , and Paul . The Sermon on the Mount gives us a way of life , and maybe some day men will understand it as the real way of life . The basis of all great moral codes is Do unto others as you would have others do unto you . Treat others as you would like to be treated . Some of you may think that such a philosophy as that has no place in politics and government . But it is the only philosophy on which you can base a lasting government . Governments built on that philosophy are built on a rock , and will not fail . When our own Government has looked after the average man first , we have grown and prospered . But when those in power have used our Government to increase the privileges of the few at the top , the life and spirit of our country have declined . Thank God most of the time we have been on the right road . In the lifetime of everyone here , we have had a chance to see how this works , although some of you may not be old enough and I am sure none of you is old enough to remember the great depression . In the last 20 years the Government of the United States has made great progress in measures to help and protect the average man . We have not been ashamed to work for human welfare at home and abroad . Now , I just want you to examine the facts and see for yourselves what the results have been in better living conditions for the American people , and in strengthening the base of our democracy . More and more people have been able to have better and better living conditions . In 1939 only one out of four families had an income of more than 2 , 000 . In 1949 it was two out of three . There are fewer poor people and more well to do people in this country now than ever before not only in this country but in the history of the world . We have been reducing inequality , not by pulling down those at the top , but by lifting up those at the bottom . This great record of progress is the result of our policy of the fair Deal . Under that policy we look out for the other fellow as well as for ourselves . That same program applies to our foreign policy . We cannot isolate ourselves from our neighbors in the rest of the world . When something hurts them , it hurts us , when something helps them , it helps us . The way to keep our own country strong and prosperous is to encourage and develop prosperity in the rest of the world . We can learn a lot from the rest of the world . There are many things that even the people of undeveloped countries in the world can teach us . We must exchange ideas . We must exchange goods . We must exchange friendships . We are not imperialists . We do not want any more territory . We do not want to conquer any people , or to dominate them . The Russian propaganda says that we are imperialists and want to conquer the world . That just is not true . We know the Soviet Government is a menace to us and to all the free world . That is why we are building up our strength , not to march against them but to discourage them from marching against us and the free world . We want to help the people in other countries to help themselves , because that makes for prosperity for us all . I want you young people to understand that if we accomplish the purpose which we propose to accomplish , it means the greatest age in the history of the world you will live in the grandest and most peaceful time that the world has ever seen . It is up to you to help carry on that purpose . It may take more than one generation to accomplish it . But we can accomplish it . We are going to accomplish it , and I know that you will help to accomplish it . I appreciate again being here . May God bless you all .<speech_sep>This is a solemn but a glorious hour . I only wish that Franklin Roosevelt had lived to witness this day . General Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations . The flags of freedom fly over all Europe . For this victory , we join in offering our thanks to the Providence which has guided and sustained us through the dark days of adversity . Our rejoicing is sobered and subdued by a supreme consciousness of the terrible price we have paid to rid the world of Hitler and his evil band . Let us not forget , my fellow Americans , the sorrow and the heartache which today abide in the homes of so many of our neighbors neighbors whose most priceless possession has been rendered as a sacrifice to redeem our liberty . We can repay the debt which we owe to our God , to our dead and to our children only by work by ceaseless devotion to the responsibilities which lie ahead of us . If I could give you a single watchword for the coming months , that word is work , work , and more work . We must work to finish the war . Our victory is but half won . The West is free , but the East is still in bondage to the treacherous tyranny of the Japanese . When the last Japanese division has surrendered unconditionally , then only will our fighting job be done . We must work to bind up the wounds of a suffering world to build an abiding peace , a peace rooted in justice and in law . We can build such a peace only by hard , toilsome , painstaking work by understanding and working with our allies in peace as we have in war . The job ahead is no less important , no less urgent , no less difficult than the task which now happily is done . I call upon every American to stick to his post until the last battle is won . Until that day , let no man abandon his post or slacken his efforts . And now , I want to read to you my formal proclamation of this occasion A Proclamation The Allied armies , through sacrifice and devotion and with God s help , have wrung from Germany a final and unconditional surrender . The western world has been freed of the evil forces which for five years and longer have imprisoned the bodies and broken the lives of millions upon millions of free born men . They have violated their churches , destroyed their homes , corrupted their children , and murdered their loved ones . Our Armies of Liberation have restored freedom to these suffering peoples , whose spirit and will the oppressors could never enslave . Much remains to be done . The victory won in the West must now be won in the East . The whole world must be cleansed of the evil from which half the world has been freed . United , the peace loving nations have demonstrated in the West that their arms are stronger by far than the might of the dictators or the tyranny of military cliques that once called us soft and weak . The power of our peoples to defend themselves against all enemies will be proved in the Pacific war as it has been proved in Europe . For the triumph of spirit and of arms which we have won , and for its promise to the peoples everywhere who join us in the love of freedom , it is fitting that we , as a nation , give thanks to Almighty God , who has strengthened us and given us the victory . Now , therefore , Harry Truman , President of the United States of America , do hereby appoint Sunday , May 13 , 1945 , to be a day of prayer . I call upon the people of the United States , whatever their faith , to unite in offering joyful thanks to God for the victory we have won , and to pray that He will support us to the end of our present struggle and guide us into the ways of peace . I also call upon my countrymen to dedicate this day of prayer to the memory of those who have given their lives to make possible our victory . In Witness Whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans I am happy to have this opportunity to talk to you once more before I leave the White House . Next Tuesday , General Eisenhower will be inaugurated as President of the United States . A short time after the new President takes his oath of office , I will be on the train going back home to Independence , Missouri . I will once again be a plain , private citizen of this great Republic . That is as it should be . Inauguration Day will be a great demonstration of our democratic process . I am glad to be a part of it glad to wish General Eisenhower all possible success , as he begins his term glad the whole world will have a chance to see how simply and how peacefully our American system transfers the vast power of the Presidency from my hands to his . It is a good object lesson in democracy . I am very proud of it . And I know you are , too . During the last 2 months I have done my best to make this transfer an orderly one . I have talked with my successor on the affairs of the country , both foreign and domestic , and my Cabinet officers have talked with their successors . I want to say that General Eisenhower and his associates have cooperated fully in this effort . Such an orderly transfer from one party to another has never taken place before in our history . I think a real precedent has been set . In speaking to you tonight , I have no new revelations to make no political statements no policy announcements . There are simply a few things in my heart that I want to say to you . I want to say goodbye and thanks for your help . And I want to talk to you a little while about what has happened since I became your President . I am speaking to you from the room where I have worked since April 12 , 1945 . This is the President s office in the West Wing of the White House . This is the desk where I have signed most of the papers that embodied the decisions I have made as President . It has been the desk of many Presidents , and will be the desk of many more . Since I became President , I have been to Europe , Mexico , Canada , Brazil , Puerto Rico , and the Virgin Islands Wake Island and Hawaii . I have visited almost every State in the Union . I have traveled 135 , 000 miles by air , 77 , 000 by rail , and 17 , 000 by ship . But the mail always followed me , and wherever I happened to be , that is where the office of the President was . The greatest part of the President s job is to make decisions big ones and small ones , dozens of them almost every day . The papers may circulate around the Government for a while but they finally reach this desk . And then , there is no place else for them to go . The President whoever he is has to decide . He cannot pass the buck to anybody . No one else can do the deciding for him . That is his job . That is what I have been doing here in this room , for almost 8 years . And over in the main part of the White House , there is a study on the second floor a room much like this one where I have worked at night and early in the morning on the papers I could not get to at the office . Of course , for more than 3 years Truman and I were not living in the White House . We were across the street in the Blair House . That was when the White House almost fell down on us and had to be rebuilt . I had a study over at the Blair House , too , but living in the Blair House was not as convenient as living in the White House . The Secret Service would not let me walk across the street , so I had to get in a car every morning to cross the street to the White House office , again at noon to go to the Blair House for lunch , again to go back to the office after lunch , and finally take an automobile at night to return to the Blair House . Fantastic , is not it But necessary , so my guards thought and they are the bosses on such matters as that . Now , of course , we are back in the White House . It is in very good condition , and General Eisenhower will be able to take up his residence in the house and work right here . That will be much more convenient for him , and I am very glad the renovation job was all completed before his term began . Your new President is taking office in quite different circumstances than when I became President 8 years ago . On April 1945 , I had been presiding over the Senate in my capacity as Vice President . When the Senate recessed about 5 of the clock in the afternoon , I walked over to the office of the Speaker of the House , Rayburn , to discuss pending legislation . As soon as I arrived , I was told that Early , one of President Roosevelt s secretaries , wanted me to call . I reached Early , and he told me to come to the White House as quickly as possible , to enter by way of the Pennsylvania Avenue entrance , and to come to Roosevelt s study . When I arrived , Roosevelt told me the tragic news , and I felt the shock that all of you felt a little later when the word came over the radio and appeared in the newspapers . President Roosevelt had died . I offered to do anything I could for Roosevelt , and then I asked the Secretary of State to call the Cabinet together . At 7 09 p . m . I was sworn in as President by Chief Justice Stone in the Cabinet Room . Things were happening fast in those days . The San Francisco conference to organize the United Nations had been called for April 25th . I was asked if that meeting would go forward . I announced that it would . That was my first decision . After attending President Roosevelt s funeral , I went to the Hall of the House of Representatives and told a joint session of the Congress that I would carry on President Roosevelt s policies . On May 7th , Germany surrendered . The announcement was made on May 8th , my 61st birthday . Churchill called me shortly after that and wanted a meeting with me and Prime Minister Stalin of Russia . Later on , a meeting was agreed upon , and Churchill , Stalin , and I met at Potsdam in Germany . Meanwhile , the first atomic explosion took place out in the New Mexico desert . The war against Japan was still going on . I made the decision that the atomic bomb had to be used to end it . I made that decision in the conviction it would save hundreds of thousands of lives Japanese as well as American . Japan surrendered , and we were faced with the huge problems of bringing the troops home and reconverting the economy from war to peace . All these things happened within just a little over 4 months from April to August 1945 . I tell you this to illustrate the tremendous scope of the work your President has to do . And all these emergencies and all the developments to meet them have required the President to put in long hours usually 17 hours a day , with no payment for overtime . I sign my name , on the average , 600 times a day , see and talk to hundreds of people every month , shake hands with thousands every year , and still carry on the business of the largest going concern in the whole world . There is no job like it on the face of the earth in the power which is concentrated here at this desk , and in the responsibility and difficulty of the decisions . I want all of you to realize how big a job , how hard a job , it is not for my sake , because I am stepping out of it but for the sake of my successor . He needs the understanding and the help of every citizen . It is not enough for you to come out once every 4 years and vote for a candidate , and then go back home and say , Well , I have done my part , now let the new President do the worrying . He cannot do the job alone . Regardless of your politics , whether you are Republican or Democrat , your fate is tied up with what is done here in this room . The President is President of the whole country . We must give him our support as citizens of the United States . He will have mine , and I want you to give him yours . I suppose that history will remember my term in office as the years when the cold war began to overshadow our lives . I have had hardly a day in office that has not been dominated by this all embracing struggle this conflict between those who love freedom and those who would lead the world back into slavery and darkness . And always in the background there has been the atomic bomb . But when history says that my term of office saw the beginning of the cold war , it will also say that in those 8 years we have set the course that can win it . We have succeeded in carving out a new set of policies to attain peace positive policies , policies of world leadership , policies that express faith in other free people . We have averted world war III up to now , and we may already have succeeded in establishing conditions which can keep that war from happening as far ahead as man can see . These are great and historic achievements that we can all be proud of . Think of the difference between our course now and our course 30 years ago . After the First World War we withdrew from world affairs we failed to act in concert with other peoples against aggression we helped to kill the League of Nations and we built up tariff barriers that strangled world trade . This time , we avoided those mistakes . We helped to found and sustain the United Nations . We have welded alliances that include the greater part of the free world . And we have gone ahead with other free countries to help build their economies and link us all together in a healthy world trade . Think back for a moment to the 1930 s and you will see the difference . The Japanese moved into Manchuria , and free men did not act . The Fascists moved into Ethiopia , and we did not act . The Nazis marched into the Rhineland , into Austria , into Czechoslovakia , and free men were paralyzed for lack of strength and unity and will . Think about those years of weakness and indecision , and the World War II which was their evil result . Then think about the speed and courage and decisiveness with which we have moved against the Communist threat since World War II . The first crisis came in 1945 and 1946 , when the Soviet Union refused to honor its agreement to remove its troops from Iran . Members of my Cabinet came to me and asked if we were ready to take the risk that a firm stand involved . I replied that we were . So we took our stand we made it clear to the Soviet Union that we expected them to honor their agreement and the Soviet troops were withdrawn from Iran . Then , in early 1947 , the Soviet Union threatened Greece and Turkey . The British sent me a message saying they could no longer keep their forces in that area . Something had to be done at once , or the eastern Mediterranean would be taken over by the Communists . On March 12th , I went before the Congress and stated our determination to help the people of Greece and Turkey maintain their independence . Today , Greece is still free and independent and Turkey is a bulwark of strength at a strategic corner of the world . Then came the Marshall plan which saved Europe , the heroic Berlin airlift , and our military aid programs . We inaugurated the North Atlantic Pact , the Rio Pact binding the Western Hemisphere together , and the defense pacts with countries of the Far Pacific . Most important of all , we acted in Korea . I was in Independence , Missouri , in June 1950 , when Secretary Acheson telephoned me and gave me the news about the invasion of Korea . I told the Secretary to lay the matter at once before the United Nations , and I came on back to Washington . Flying back over the flatlands of the Middle West and over the Appalachians that summer afternoon , I had a lot of time to think . I turned the problem over in my mind in many ways , but my thoughts kept coming back to the 1930 s to Manchuria , to Ethiopia , the Rhineland , Austria , and finally to Munich . Here was history repeating itself . Here was another probing action , another testing action . If we let the Republic of Korea go under , some other country would be next , and then another . And all the time , the courage and confidence of the free world would be ebbing away , just as it did in the 1930 s . And the United Nations would go the way of the League of Nations . When I reached Washington , I met immediately with the Secretary of State , the Secretary of Defense , and General Bradley , and the other civilian and military officials who had information and advice to help me decide on what to do . We talked about the problems long and hard . We considered those problems very carefully . It was not easy to make the decision to send American boys again into battle . I was a soldier in the First World War , and I know what a soldier goes through . I know well the anguish that mothers and fathers and families go through . So I knew what was ahead if we acted in Korea . But after all this was said , we realized that the issue was whether there would be fighting in a limited area now or on a much larger scale later on whether there would be some casualties now or many more casualties later . So a decision was reached the decision I believe was the most important in my time as President of the United States . In the days that followed , the most heartening fact was that the American people clearly agreed with the decision . And in Korea , our men are fighting as valiantly as Americans have ever fought because they know they are fighting in the same cause of freedom in which Americans have stood ever since the beginning of the Republic . Where free men had failed the test before , this time we met the test . We met it firmly . We met it successfully . The aggression has been repelled . The Communists have seen their hopes of easy conquest go down the drain . The determination of free people to defend themselves has been made clear to the Kremlin . As I have thought about our worldwide struggle with the Communists these past 8 years day in and day out I have never once doubted that you , the people of our country , have the will to do what is necessary to win this terrible fight against communism . I know the people of this country have that will and determination , and I have always depended on it . Because I have been sure of that , I have been able to make necessary decisions even though they called for sacrifices by all of us . And I have not been wrong in my judgment of the American people . That same assurance of our people s determination will be General Eisenhower s greatest source of strength in carrying on this struggle . Now , once in a while , I get a letter from some impatient person asking , why do not we get it over with Why do not we issue an ultimatum , make all out war , drop the atomic bomb For most Americans , the answer is quite simple We are not made that way . We are a moral people . Peace is our goal , with justice and freedom . We cannot , of our own free will , violate the very principles that we are striving to defend . The whole purpose of what we are doing is to prevent world war IIStarting a war is no way to make peace . But if anyone still thinks that just this once , bad means can bring good ends , then let me remind you of this We are living in the 8th year of the atomic age . We are not the only nation that is learning to unleash the power of the atom . A third world war might dig the grave not only of our Communist opponents but also of our own society , our world as well as theirs . Starting an atomic war is totally unthinkable for rational men . Then , some of you may ask , when and how will the cold war end I think I can answer that simply . The Communist world has great resources , and it looks strong . But there is a fatal flaw in their society . Theirs is a godless system , a system of slavery there is no freedom in it , no consent . The Iron Curtain , the secret police , the constant purges , all these are symptoms of a great basic weakness the rulers fear of their own people . In the long run the strength of our free society , and our ideals , will prevail over a system that has respect for neither God nor man . Last week , in my State of the Union Message to the Congress and I hope you will all take the time to read it I explained how I think we will finally win through . As the free world grows stronger , more united , more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain and as the Soviet hopes for easy expansion are blocked then there will have to come a time of change in the Soviet world . Nobody can say for sure when that is going to be , or exactly how it will come about , whether by revolution , or trouble in the satellite states , or by a change inside the Kremlin . Whether the Communist rulers shift their policies of their own free will or whether the change comes about in some other way I have not a doubt in the world that a change will occur . I have a deep and abiding faith in the destiny of free men . With patience and courage , we shall some day move on into a new era a wonderful golden age an age when we can use the peaceful tools that science has forged for us to do away with poverty and human misery everywhere on earth . Think what can be done , once our capital , our skills , our science most of all atomic energy can be released from the tasks of defense and turned wholly to peaceful purposes all around the world . There is no end to what can be done . I cannot help but dream out loud just a little here . The Tigris and Euphrates Valley can be made to bloom as it did in the times of Babylon and Nineveh . Israel can be made the country of milk and honey as it was in the time of Joshua . There is a plateau in Ethiopia some 6 , 000 to 8 , 000 feet high , that has 65 , 000 square miles of land just exactly like the corn belt in northern Illinois . Enough food can be raised there to feed a hundred million people . There are places in South America places in Colombia and Venezuela and Brazil just like that plateau in Ethiopia places where food could be raised for millions of people . These things can be done , and they are self liquidating projects . If we can get peace and safety in the world under the United Nations , the developments will come so fast we will not recognize the world in which we now live . This is our dream of the future our picture of the world we hope to have when the Communist threat is overcome . I have talked a lot tonight about the menace of communism and our fight against it because that is the overriding issue of our time . But there are some other things we have done that history will record . One of them is that we in America have learned how to attain real prosperity for our people . We have 62 1 2 million people at work . Businessmen , farmers , laborers , white collar people , all have better incomes and more of the good things of life than ever before in the history of the world . There has not been a failure of an insured bank in nearly 9 years . No depositor has lost a cent in that period . And the income of our people has been fairly distributed , perhaps more so than at any other time in recent history . We have made progress in spreading the blessings of American life to all of our people . There has been a tremendous awakening of the American conscience on the great issues of civil rights equal economic opportunities , equal rights of citizenship , and equal educational opportunities for all our people , whatever their race or religion or status of birth . So , as I empty the drawers of this desk , and as Truman and I leave the White House , we have no regret . We feel we have done our best in the public service . I hope and believe we have contributed to the welfare of this Nation and to the peace of the world . When Franklin Roosevelt died , I felt there must be a million men better qualified than to take up the Presidential task . But the work was mine to do , and I had to do it . And I have tried to give it everything that was in me . Through all of it , through all the years that I have worked here in this room , I have been well aware I did not really work alone that you were working with me . No President could ever hope to lead our country , or to sustain the burdens of this office , save as the people helped with their support . I have had that help you have given me that support on all our great essential undertakings to build the free world s strength and keep the peace . Those are the big things . Those are the things we have done together . For that I shall be grateful , always . And now , the time has come for me to say good night and God bless you all .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans I want to talk to you plainly tonight about what we are doing in Korea and about our policy in the Far East . In the simplest terms , what we are doing in Korea is this We are trying to prevent a third world war . I think most people in this country recognized that fact last June . And they warmly supported the decision of the Government to help the Republic of Korea against the Communist aggressors . Now , many persons , even some who applauded our decision to defend Korea , have forgotten the basic reason for our action . It is right for us to be in Korea now . It was right last June . It is right today . I want to remind you why this is true . The Communists in the Kremlin are engaged in a monstrous conspiracy to stamp out freedom all over the world . If they were to succeed , the United States would be numbered among their principal victims . It must be clear to everyone that the United States cannot and will not sit idly by and await foreign conquest . The only question is What is the best time to meet the threat and how is the best way to meet it The best time to meet the threat is in the beginning . It is easier to put out a fire in the beginning when it is small than after it has become a roaring blaze . And the best way to meet the threat of aggression is for the peace loving nations to act together . If they do not act together , they are likely to be picked off , one by one . If they had followed the right policies in the 1930 s if the free countries had acted together to crush the aggression of the dictators , and if they had acted in the beginning when the aggression was small there probably would have been no World War II . If history has taught us anything , it is that aggression anywhere in the world is a threat to the peace everywhere in the world . When that aggression is supported by the cruel and selfish rulers of a powerful nation who are bent on conquest , it becomes a dear and present danger to the security and independence of every free nation . This is a lesson that most people in this country have learned thoroughly . This is the basic reason why we joined in creating the United Nations . And , since the end of World War Iwe have been putting that lesson into practice we have been working with other free nations to check the aggressive designs of the Soviet Union before they can result in a third world war . That is what we did in Greece , when that nation was threatened by the aggression of international communism . The attack against Greece could have led to general war . But this country came to the aid of Greece . The United Nations supported Greek resistance . With our help , the determination and efforts of the Greek people defeated the attack on the spot . Another big Communist threat to peace was the Berlin blockade . That too could have led to war . But again it was settled because free men would not back down in an emergency . The aggression against Korea is the boldest and most dangerous move the Communists have yet made . The attack on Korea was part of a greater plan for conquering all of Asia . I would like to read to you from a secret intelligence report which came to us after the attack on Korea . It is a report of a speech a Communist army officer in North Korea gave to a group of spies and saboteurs last May , 1 month before South Korea was invaded . The report shows in great detail how this invasion was part of a carefully prepared plot . Here , in part , is what the Communist officer , who had been trained in Moscow , told his men Our forces , he said , are scheduled to attack South Korean forces about the middle of June . . . . The coming attack on South Korea marks the first step toward the liberation of Asia . Notice that he used the word liberation . This is Communist double talk meaning conquest . I have another secret intelligence report here . This one tells what another Communist officer in the Far East told his men several months before the invasion of Korea . Here is what he said In order to successfully undertake the long awaited world revolution , we must first unify Asia . . . . lava , Indochina , Malaya , India , Tibet , Thailand , Philippines , and Japan are our ultimate targets . . . . The United States is the only obstacle on our road for the liberation of all the countries in southeast Asia . In other words , we must unify the people of Asia and crush the United States . Again , liberation in commie language means conquest . That is what the Communist leaders are telling their people , and that is what they have been trying to do . They want to control all Asia from the Kremlin . This plan of conquest is in flat contradiction to what we believe . We believe that Korea belong to the Koreans , we believe that India belongs to the Indians , we believe that all the nations of Asia should be free to work out their affairs in their own way . This is the basis of peace in the Far East , and it is the basis of peace everywhere else . The whole Communist imperialism is back of the attack on peace in the Far East . It was the Soviet Union that trained and equipped the North Koreans for aggression . The Chinese Communists massed 44 well trained and well equipped divisions on the Korean frontier . These were the troops they threw into battle when the North Korean Communists were beaten . The question we have had to face is whether the Communist plan of conquest can be stopped without a general war . Our Government and other countries associated with us in the United Nations believe that the best chance of stopping it without a general war is to meet the attack in Korea and defeat it there . That is what we have been doing . It is a difficult and bitter task . But so far it has been successful . So far , we have prevented world war III . So far , by fighting a limited war in Korea , we have prevented aggression from succeeding , and bringing on a general war . And the ability of the whole free world to resist Communist aggression has been greatly improved . We have taught the enemy a lesson . He has found that aggression is not cheap or easy , Moreover , men all over the world who want to remain free have been given new courage and new hope . They know now that the champions of freedom can stand up and fight , and that they will stand up and fight . Our resolute stand in Korea is helping the forces of freedom now fighting in Indochina and other countries in that part of the world . It has already slowed down the timetable of conquest . In Korea itself there are signs that the enemy is building up his ground forces for a new mass offensive . We also know that there have been large increases in the enemy s available air forces . If a new attack comes , I feel confident it will be turned back . The United Nations fighting forces are tough and able and well equipped . They are fighting for a just cause . They are proving to all the world that the principle of collective security will work . We are proud of all these forces for the magnificent job they have done against heavy odds . We pray that their efforts may succeed , for upon their success may hinge the peace of the world . The Communist side must now choose its course of action . The Communist rulers may press the attack against us . They may take further action which will spread the conflict . They have that choice , and with it the awful responsibility for what may follow . The Communists also have the choice of a peaceful settlement which could lead to a general relaxation of the tensions in the Far East . The decision is theirs , because the forces of the United Nations will strive to limit the conflict if possible . We do not want to see the conflict in Korea extended . We are trying to prevent a world war not to start one . And the best way to do that is to make it plain that we and the other free countries will continue to resist the attack . But you may ask why cannot we take other steps to punish the aggressor . Why do not we bomb Manchuria and China itself Why do not we assist the Chinese Nationalist troops to land on the mainland of China If we were to do these things we would be running a very grave risk of starting a general war . If that were to happen , we would have brought about the exact situation we are trying to prevent . If we were to do these things , we would become entangled in a vast conflict on the continent of Asia and our task would become immeasurably more difficult all over the world . What would suit the ambitions of the Kremlin better than for our military forces to be committed to a full scale war with Red China It may well be that , in spite of our best efforts , the Communists may spread the war . But it would be wrong tragically wrong for us to take the initiative in extending the war . The dangers are great . Make no mistake about it . Behind the North Koreans and Chinese Communists in the front lines stand additional millions of Chinese soldiers . And behind the Chinese stand the tanks , the planes , the submarines , the soldiers , and the scheming rulers of the Soviet Union . Our aim is to avoid the spread of the conflict . The course we have been following is the one best calculated to avoid an all out war . It is the course consistent with our obligation to do all we can to maintain international peace and security . Our experience in Greece and Berlin shows that it is the most effective course of action we can follow . First of all , it is clear that our efforts in Korea can blunt the will of the Chinese Communists to continue the struggle . The United Nations forces have put up a tremendous fight in Korea and have inflicted very heavy casualties on the enemy . Our forces are stronger now than they have been before . These are plain facts which may discourage the Chinese Communists from continuing their attack . Second , the free world as a whole is growing in military strength every day . In the United States , in Western Europe , and throughout the world , free men are alert to the Soviet threat and are building their defenses . This may . discourage the Communist rulers from continuing the war in Korea and from undertaking new acts of aggression elsewhere . If the Communist authorities realize that they cannot defeat us in Korea , if they realize it would be foolhardy to widen the hostilities beyond Korea , then they may recognize the folly of continuing their aggression . A peaceful settlement may then be possible . The door is always open . Then we may achieve a settlement in Korea which will not compromise the principles and purposes of the United Nations . I have thought long and hard about this question of extending the war in Asia . I have discussed it many times with the ablest military advisers in the country . I believe with all my heart that the course we are following is the best course . I believe that we must try to limit the war to Korea for these vital reasons to make sure that the precious lives of our fighting men are not wasted to see that the security of our country and the free world is not needlessly jeopardized and to prevent a third world war . A number of events have made it evident that General MacArthur did not agree with that policy . I have therefore considered it essential to relieve General MacArthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy . It was with the deepest personal regret that I found myself compelled to take this action . General MacArthur is one of our greatest military commanders . But the cause of world peace is much more important than any individual . The change in commands in the Far East means no change whatever in the policy of the United States . We will carry on the fight in Korea with vigor and determination in an effort to bring the war to a speedy and successful conclusion . The new commander , Lt . Gen . Matthew Ridgway , has already demonstrated that he has the great qualities of military leadership needed for this task . We are ready , at any time , to negotiate for a restoration of peace in the area . But we will not engage in appeasement . We are only interested in real peace . Real peace can be achieved through a settlement based on the following factors One The fighting must stop . Two Concrete steps must be taken to insure that the fighting will not break out again . Three There must be an end to the aggression . A settlement founded upon these elements would open the way for the unification of Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign forces . In the meantime , I want to be clear about our military objective . We are fighting to resist an outrageous aggression in Korea . We are trying to keep the Korean conflict from spreading to other areas . But at the same time we must conduct our military activities so as to insure the security of our forces . This is essential if they are to continue the fight until the enemy abandons its ruthless attempt to destroy the Republic of Korea . That is our military objective to repel attack and to restore peace . In the hard fighting in Korea , we are proving that collective action among nations is not only a high principle but a workable means of resisting aggression . Defeat of aggression in Korea may be the turning point in the world s search for a practical way of achieving peace and security . The struggle of the United Nations in Korea is a struggle for peace . Free nations have united their strength in an effort to prevent a third world war . That war can come if the Communist rulers want it to come . But this Nation and its allies will not be responsible for its coming . We do not want to widen the conflict . We will use every effort to prevent that disaster . And in so doing , we know that we are following the great principles of peace , freedom , and justice .<speech_sep>
