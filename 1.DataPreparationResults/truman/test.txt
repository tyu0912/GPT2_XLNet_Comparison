I am sorry that the microphones are in the way , but I must leave them the way they are because I have got to be able to see what I am doing as I am always able to see what I am doing . I cannot tell you how very much I appreciate the honor which you have just conferred upon me . I shall continue to try to deserve it . I accept the nomination . And I want to thank this convention for its unanimous nomination of my good friend and colleague , Senator Barkley of Kentucky . He is a great man , and a great public servant . Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make these Republicans like it do not you forget that We will do that because they are wrong and we are right , and I will prove it to you in just a few minutes . This convention met to express the will and reaffirm the beliefs of the Democratic Party . There have been differences of opinion , and that is the democratic way . Those differences have been settled by a majority vote , as they should be . Now it is time for us to get together and beat the common enemy . And that is up to you . We have been working together for victory in a great cause . Victory has become a habit of our party . It has been elected four times in succession , and I am convinced it will be elected a fifth time next November . The reason is that the people know that the Democratic Party is the people s party , and the Republican Party is the party of special interest , and it always has been and always will be . The record of the Democratic Party is written in the accomplishments of the last 16 years . I do not need to repeat them . They have been very ably placed before this convention by the keynote speaker , the candidate for Vice President , and by the permanent chairman . Confidence and security have been brought to the people by the Democratic Party . Farm income has increased from less than 2 billion in 1932 to more than 18 billion in 1947 . Never in the world were the farmers of any republic or any kingdom or any other country as prosperous as the farmers of the United States and if they do not do their duty by the Democratic Party , they are the most ungrateful people in the world Wages and salaries in this country have increased from 29 billion in 1933 to more than 128 billion in 1947 . That is labor , and labor never had but one friend in politics , and that is the Democratic Party and Franklin Roosevelt . And I say to labor what I have said to the farmers they are the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the Democratic Party by this year . The total national income has increased from less than 40 billion in 1933 to 203 billion in 1947 , the greatest in all the history of the world . These benefits have been spread to all the people , because it is the business of the Democratic Party to see that the people get a fair share of these things . This last , worst 80th Congress proved just the opposite for the Republicans . The record on foreign policy of the Democratic Party is that the United States has been turned away permanently from isolationism , and we have converted the greatest and best of the Republicans to our viewpoint on that subject . The United States has to accept its full responsibility for leadership in international affairs . We have been the backers and the people who organized and started the United Nations , first started under that great Democratic President , Woodrow Wilson , as the League of Nations . The League was sabotaged by the Republicans in 1920 . And we must see that the United Nations continues a strong and growing body , so we can have everlasting peace in the world . We removed trade barriers in the world , which is the best asset we can have for peace . Those trade barriers must not be put back into operation again . We have started the foreign aid program , which means the recovery of Europe and China , and the Far East . We instituted the program for Greece and Turkey , and I will say to you that all these things were done in a cooperative and bipartisan manner . The Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and House were taken into the full confidence of the President in every one of these moves , and do not let anybody tell you anything else . As I have said time and time again , foreign policy should be the policy of the whole Nation and not the policy of one party or the other . Partisanship should stop at the water s edge and I shall continue to preach that through this whole campaign . I would like to say a word or two now on what I think the Republican philosophy is and I will speak from actions and from history and from experience . The situation in 1932 was due to the policies of the Republican Party control of the Government of the United States . The Republican Party , as I said a while ago , favors the privileged few and not the common everyday man . Ever since its inception , that party has been under the control of special privilege and they have completely proved it in the 80th Congress . They proved it by the things they did to the people , and not for them . They proved it by the things they failed to do . Now , let us look at some of them just a few . Time and time again I recommended extension of price control before it expired June 30 , 1946 . I asked for that extension in September 1945 , in November 1945 , in a Message on the State of the Union in 1946 and that price control legislation did not come to my desk until June 30 , 1946 , on the day on which it was supposed to expire . And it was such a rotten bill that I could not sign it . And 30 days after that , they sent me one just as bad . I had to sign it , because they quit and went home . They said , when OPA died , that prices would adjust themselves for the benefit of the country . They have been adjusting themselves all right They have gone all the way off the chart in adjusting themselves , at the expense of the consumer and for the benefit of the people that hold the goods . I called a special session of the Congress in November 1947 November 17 , 1947 and I set out a 10 point program for the welfare and benefit of this country , among other things standby controls . I got nothing . Congress has still done nothing . Way back 4 1 2 years ago , while I was in the Senate , we passed a housing bill in the Senate known as the Wagner Ellender Taft bill . It was a bill to clear the slums in the big cities and to help to erect low rent housing . That bill , as I said , passed the Senate 4 years ago . It died in the House . That bill was reintroduced in the 80th Congress as the Taft Ellender Wagner bill . The name was slightly changed , but it is practically the same bill . And it passed the Senate , but it was allowed to die in the House of Representatives and they sat on that bill , and finally forced it out of the Banking and Currency Committee , and the Rules Committee took charge , and it still is in the Rules Committee . But desperate pleas from Philadelphia in that convention that met here 3 weeks ago could not get that housing bill passed . They passed a bill they called a housing bill , which is not worth the paper it is written on . In the field of labor we needed moderate legislation to promote labor management harmony , but Congress passed instead that so called Taft Hartley Act , which has disrupted labor management relations and will cause strife and bitterness for years to come if it is not repealed , as the Democratic platform says it ought to be repealed . On the Labor Department , the Republican platform of 1944 said , if they were in power , that they would build up a strong Labor Department . They have simply torn it up . Only one bureau is left that is functioning , and they cut the appropriation of that so it can hardly function . I recommended an increase in the minimum wage . What did I get Nothing . Absolutely nothing . I suggested that the schools in this country are crowded , teachers underpaid , and that there is a shortage of teachers . One of our greatest national needs is more and better schools . I urged the Congress to provide 300 million to aid the States in the present educational crisis . Congress did nothing about it . Time and again I have recommended improvements in the social security law , including extending protection to those not now covered , and increasing the amount of benefits , to reduce the eligibility age of women from 65 to 60 years . Congress studied the matter for 2 years , but could not find the time to extend or increase the benefits . But they did find time to take social security benefits away from 750 , 000 people , and they passed that over my veto . I have repeatedly asked the Congress to pass a health program . The Nation suffers from lack of medical care . That situation can be remedied any time the Congress wants to act upon it . Everybody knows that I recommended to the Congress the civil rights program . I did that because I believed it to be my duty under the Constitution . Some of the members of my own party disagree with me violently on this matter . But they stand up and do it openly People can tell where they stand . But the Republicans all professed to be for these measures . But Congress failed to act . They had enough men to do it , they could have had cloture , they did not have to have a filibuster . They had enough people in that Congress that would vote for cloture . Now everybody likes to have low taxes , but we must reduce the national debt in times of prosperity . And when tax relief can be given , it ought to go to those who need it most , and not those who need it least , as this Republican rich man s tax bill did when they passed it over my veto on the third try . The first one of these was so rotten that they could not even stomach it themselves . They finally did send one that was somewhat improved , but it still helps the rich and sticks a knife into the back of the poor . Now the Republicans came here a few weeks ago , and they wrote a platform . I hope you have all read that platform . They adopted the platform , and that platform had a lot of promises and statements of what the Republican Party is for , and what they would do if they were in power . They promised to do in that platform a lot of things I have been asking them to do that they have refused to do when they had the power . The Republican platform cries about cruelly high prices . I have been trying to get them to do something about high prices ever since they met the first time . Now listen This is equally as bad , and as cynical . The Republican platform comes out for slum clearance and low rental housing . I have been trying to get them to pass that housing bill ever since they met the first time , and it is still resting in the Rules Committee , that bill . The Republican platform favors educational opportunity and promotion of education . I have been trying to get Congress to do something about that ever since they came there , and that bill is at rest in the House of Representatives . The Republican platform is for extending and increasing social security benefits . Think of that Increasing social security benefits Yet when they had the opportunity , they took 750 , 000 off the social security rolls I wonder if they think they can fool the people of the United States with such poppycock as that There is a long list of these promises in that Republican platform . If it were not so late , I would tell you all about them . I have discussed a number of these failures of the Republican 80th Congress . Every one of them is important . Two of them are of major concern to nearly every American family . They failed to do anything about high prices , they failed to do anything about housing . My duty as President requires that I use every means within my power to get the laws the people need on matters of such importance and urgency . I am therefore calling this Congress back into session July 26th . On the 26th day of July , which out in Missouri we call Turnip Day , I am going to call Congress back and ask them to pass laws to halt rising prices , to meet the housing crisis which they are saying they are for in their platform . At the same time I shall ask them to act upon other vitally needed measures such as aid to education , which they say they are for a national health program civil rights legislation , which they say they are for an increase in the minimum wage , which I doubt very much they are for extension of the social security coverage and increased benefits , which they say they are for funds for projects needed in our program to provide public power and cheap electricity . By indirection , this 80th Congress has tried to sabotage the power policies the United States has pursued for 14 years . That power lobby is as bad as the real estate lobby , which is sitting on the housing bill . I shall ask for adequate and decent laws for displaced persons in place of this anti Semitic , anti Catholic law which this 80th Congress passed . Now , my friends , if there is any reality behind that Republican platform , we ought to get some action from a short session of the 80th Congress . They can do this job in 15 days , if they want to do it . They will still have time to go out and run for office . They are going to try to dodge their responsibility . They are going to drag all the red herrings they can across this campaign , but I am here to say that Senator Barkley and I are not going to let them get away with it . Now , what that worst 80th Congress does in this special session will be the test . The American people will not decide by listening to mere words , or by reading a mere platform . They will decide on the record , the record as it has been written . And in the record is the stark truth , that the battle lines of 1948 are the same as they were in 1932 , when the Nation lay prostrate and helpless as a result of Republican misrule and inaction . In 1932 we were attacking the citadel of special privilege and greed . We were fighting to drive the money changers from the temple . Today , in 1948 , we are now the defenders of the stronghold of democracy and of equal opportunity , the haven of the ordinary people of this land and not of the favored classes or the powerful few . The battle cry is just the same now as it was in 1932 , and I paraphrase the words of Franklin Roosevelt as he issued the challenge , in accepting nomination in Chicago This is more than a political call to arms . Give me your help , not to win votes alone , but to win in this new crusade to keep America secure and safe for its own people . Now my friends , with the help of God and the wholehearted push which you can put behind this campaign , we can save this country from a continuation of the 80th Congress , and from misrule from now on . I must have your help . You must get in and push , and win this election . The country cannot afford another Republican Congress .<speech_sep>My fellow countrymen At noon today I sent to Congress a message vetoing the Taft Hartley labor bill . I vetoed this bill because I am convinced it is a bad bill . It is bad for labor , bad for management , and bad for the country . I had hoped that the Congress would send me a labor bill I could sign . I have said before , and I say it now , that we need legislation to correct abuses in the field of labor relations . Last January I made specific recommendations to the Congress as to the kind of labor legislation we should have immediately . I urged that the Congress provide for a commission , to be made up of representatives of the Congress , the public , labor and management , to study the entire field of labor management relations and to suggest what additional laws we should have . I believe that my proposals were accepted by the great majority of our people as fair and just . If the Congress had accepted those recommendations , we would have today the basis for improved labor management relations . I would gladly have signed a labor bill if it had taken us in the right direction of stable , peaceful labor relations even though it might not have been drawn up exactly as I wished . I would have signed a bill with some doubtful features if , taken as a whole , it had been a good bill . But the Taft Hartley bill is a shocking piece of legislation . It is unfair to the working people of this country . It clearly abuses the right , which millions of our citizens now enjoy , to join together and bargain with their employers for fair wages and fair working conditions . Under no circumstances could I have signed this bill . The restrictions that this bill places on our workers go far beyond what our people have been led to believe . This is no innocent bill . It is interesting to note that on June 4 , Congressman Hartley on the floor of the House of Representatives , made the following statement , and I quote You are going to find there is more in this bill than may meet the eye . That is a revealing description of this bill by one of its authors . There is so much more in it than the people have been led to believe , that I am sure that very few understand what the Taft Hartley bill would do if it should become law . That is why I am speaking to you tonight . I want you to know the real meaning of this bill . We have all been told , by its proponents , that this is a moderate bill . We have been told that the bill was harsh and drastic when it was first passed by the House of Representatives , but that the Senate had persuaded the House to drop out the harsh provisions and that the final bill the bill sent to me was mild and moderate . But I found no truth in the claims that the bill sent to me was mild or moderate . I found that the basic purpose and much of the language of the original House of Representatives bill were still in the final bill . In fact , the final bill follows the provisions of the original House bill in at least 36 separate places . We have all been told that the Taft Hartley bill is favorable to the wage earners of this country . It has been claimed that workers need to be saved from their own folly and that this bill would provide the means of salvation . Some people have called this bill the workers bill of rights . Let us see what this bill really would do to our workingmen . The bill is deliberately designed to weaken labor unions . When the sponsors of the bill claim that by weakening unions , they are giving rights back to individual workingmen , they ignore the basic reason why unions are important in our democracy . Unions exist so that laboring men can bargain with their employers on a basis of equality . Because of unions , the living standards of our working people have increased steadily until they are today the highest in the world . A bill which would weaken unions would undermine our national policy of collective bargaining . The Taft Hartley bill would do just that . It would take us back in the direction of the old evils of individual bargaining . It would take the bargaining power away from the workers and give more power to management . This bill would even take away from our workingmen some bargaining fights which they enjoyed before the Wagner Act was passed 12 years ago . If we weaken our system of collective bargaining , we weaken the position of every workingman in the country . This bill would again expose workers to the abuses of labor injunctions . It would make unions liable for damage suits for actions which have long been considered lawful . This bill would treat all unions alike . Unions which have fine records , with long years of peaceful relations with management , would be hurt by this bill just as much as the few troublemakers . The country needs legislation which will get rid of abuses . We do not need and we do not want legislation which will take fundamental rights away from our working people . We have been told that the Taft Hartley bill is a means by which the country can be protected from nationwide strikes in vital industries . The terms of the bill do not support this claim . Many people are under the impression that this bill would prevent or settle a strike in the coal industry . I sincerely trust that the coal operators and the miners will soon come to an agreement on the terms of a contract and that there will be no interruption of coal mining . But if the miners and the operators do not reach agreement , and if this bill should become law , it is likely that the most that could be accomplished under the complicated procedures of the bill would be postponement of a strike from July until October . Under this bill a work stoppage in the coal mines might be prevented for 80 days and then , if agreement had not been reached , the miners would be free to strike , and it would be mandatory for the President to refer the whole matter to Congress , even if Congress were not in session . Postponing a strike in the coal industry until the approach of winter , when our need for coal is acute , is certainly not the way to protect the Nation against the dangers of a shortage of coal . The bill would not aid fair and early settlements of disputes in vital industries . We have been told , by the supporters of the Taft Hartley bill , that it would reduce industrial strife . On the contrary , I am convinced that it would increase industrial strife . The bill would soon upset security clauses in thousands of existing agreements between labor and management . These agreements were mutually arrived at and furnish a satisfactory basis for relations between worker and employer . They provide stability in industry . With their present types of agreements outlawed by this bill , the parties would have to find a new basis for agreement . The restrictions in this bill would make the process of reaching new agreements a long and bitter one . The bill would increase industrial strife because a number of its provisions deprive workers of legal protection of fundamental rights . They would then have no means of protecting these rights except by striking . The bill would open up opportunities for endless law suits by employers against unions and by unions against employers . For example , it would make employers vulnerable to an immense number of law suits , since grievances , however minor , could be taken into court by dissatisfied workers . Insofar as employers are concerned , I predict that if this bill should become law they would regret the day that it was conceived . It is loaded with provisions that would plague and hamper management . It is filled with hidden legal traps that would take labor relations out of the plant , where they belong , and place them in the courts . Another defect is that in trying to correct labor abuses the Taft Hartley bill goes so far that it would threaten fundamental democratic freedoms . One provision undertakes to prevent political contributions and expenditures by labor organizations and corporations . This provision would forbid a union newspaper from commenting on candidates in national elections . It might well prevent an incorporated radio network from spending any money in connection with the national convention of a political party . It might even prevent the League of Women Voters which is incorporated from using its funds to inform its members about the record of a political candidate . I regard this provision of the Taft Hartley bill as a dangerous challenge to free speech and our free press . One of the basic errors of this bill is that it ignores the fact that over the years we have been making real progress in labor management relations . We have been achieving slow but steady improvement in cooperation between employers and workers . We must always remember that under our free economic system management and labor are associates . They work together for their own benefit and for the benefit of the public . The Taft Hartley bill fails to recognize these fundamental facts . Many provisions of the bill would have the result of changing employers and workers from members of the same team to opponents on contending teams . I feel deep concern about what this would do to the steady progress we have made through the years . I fear that this type of legislation would cause the people of our country to divide into opposing groups . If conflict is created , as this bill would create it if the seeds of discord are sown , as this bill would sow them our unity will suffer and our strength will be impaired . This bill does not resemble the labor legislation which I have recommended to the Congress . The whole purpose of this bill is contrary to the sound growth of our national labor policy . There is still time to enact progressive , constructive legislation during the present session . We need such legislation to correct abuses and to further our advance in labor management relations . We seek in this country today a formula which will treat all men fairly and justly , and which will give our people security in the necessities of life . As our generous American spirit prompts us to aid the world to rebuild , we must , at the same time , construct a better America in which all can share equitably in the blessings of democracy . The Taft Hartley bill threatens the attainment of this goal . For the sake of the future of this Nation , I hope that this bill will not become law .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , Members of the Congress It is with a heavy heart that I stand before you , my friends and colleagues , in the Congress of the United States . Only yesterday , we laid to rest the mortal remains of our beloved President , Franklin Delano Roosevelt . At a time like this , words are inadequate . The most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence . Yet , in this decisive hour , when world events are moving so rapidly , our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemies . In His infinite wisdom , Almighty God has seen fit to take from us a great man who loved , and was beloved by , all humanity . No man could possibly fill the tremendous void left by the passing of that noble soul . No words can ease the aching hearts of untold millions of every race , creed and color . The world knows it has lost a heroic champion of justice and freedom . Tragic fate has thrust upon us grave responsibilities . We must carry on . Our departed leader never looked backward . He looked forward and moved forward . That is what he would want us to do . That is what America will do . So much blood has already been shed for the ideals which we cherish , and for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt lived and died , that we dare not permit even a momentary pause in the hard fight for victory . Today , the entire world is looking to America for enlightened leadership to peace and progress . Such a leadership requires vision , courage and tolerance . It can be provided only by a united nation deeply devoted to the highest ideals . With great humility I call upon all Americans to help me keep our nation united in defense of those ideals which have been so eloquently proclaimed by Franklin Roosevelt . I want in turn to assure my fellow Americans and all of those who love peace and liberty throughout the world that I will support and defend those ideals with all my strength and all my heart . That is my duty and I shall not shirk it . So that there can be no possible misunderstanding , both Germany and Japan can be certain , beyond any shadow of a doubt , that America will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance remains We are deeply conscious of the fact that much hard fighting is still ahead of us . Having to pay such a heavy price to make complete victory certain , America will never become a party to any plan for partial victory To settle for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize the future security of all the world . Our demand has been , and it remains Unconditional Surrender We will not traffic with the breakers of the peace on the terms of the peace . The responsibility for making of the peace and it is a very grave responsibility must rest with the defenders of the peace . We are not unconscious of the dictates of humanity . We do not wish to see unnecessary or unjustified suffering . But the laws of God and of man have been violated and the guilty must not go unpunished . Nothing shall shake our determination to punish the war criminals even though we must pursue them to the ends of the earth . Lasting peace can never be secured if we permit our dangerous opponents to plot future wars with impunity at any mountain retreat however distant . In this shrinking world , it is futile to seek safety behind geographical barriers . Real security will be found only in law and in justice . Here in America , we have labored long and hard to achieve a social order worthy of our great heritage . In our time , tremendous progress has been made toward a really democratic way of life . Let me assure the forward looking people of America that there will be no relaxation in our efforts to improve the lot of the common people . In the difficult days ahead , unquestionably we shall face problems of staggering proportions . However , with the faith of our fathers in our hearts , we do not fear the future . On the battlefields , we have frequently faced overwhelming odds and won At home , Americans will not be less resolute We shall never cease our struggle to preserve and maintain our American way of life . At this moment , America , along with her brave Allies , is paying again a heavy price for the defense of our freedom . With characteristic energy , we are assisting in the liberation of entire nations . Gradually , the shackles of slavery are being broken by the forces of freedom . All of us are praying for a speedy victory . Every day peace is delayed costs a terrible toll . The armies of liberation today are bringing to an end Hitler s ghastly threat to dominate the world . Tokyo rocks under the weight of our bombs . The grand strategy of the United Nations war has been determined due in no small measure to the vision of our departed Commander in Chief . We are now carrying out our part of that strategy under the able direction of Admiral Leahy , General Marshall , Admiral King , General Arnold , General Eisenhower , Admiral Nimitz and General MacArthur . I want the entire world to know that this direction must and will remain unchanged and unhampered Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid . They have earned our undying gratitude . America will never forget their sacrifices . Because of these sacrifices , the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon . Our forefathers came to our rugged shores in search of religious tolerance , political freedom and economic opportunity . For those fundamental rights , they risked their lives . We well know today that such rights can be preserved only by constant vigilance , the eternal price of liberty Within an hour after I took the oath of office , I announced that the San Francisco Conference would proceed . We will face the problems of peace with the same courage that we have faced and mastered the problems of war . In the memory of those who have made the supreme sacrifice in the memory of our fallen President we shall not fail It is not enough to yearn for peace . We must work , and if necessary , fight for it . The task of creating a sound international organization is complicated and difficult . Yet , without such organization , the rights of man on earth cannot be protected . Machinery for the just settlement of international differences must be found . Without such machinery , the entire world will have to remain an armed camp . The world will be doomed to deadly conflict , devoid of hope for real peace . Fortunately , people have retained hope for a durable peace . Thoughtful people have always had faith that ultimately justice must triumph . Past experience surely indicates that , without justice , an enduring peace becomes impossible . In bitter despair , some people have come to believe that wars are inevitable . With tragic fatalism , they insist that wars have always been , of necessity , and of necessity wars always will be . To such defeatism , men and women of good will must not and can not yield . The outlook for humanity is not so hopeless . During the dark hours of this horrible war , entire nations were kept going by something intangible hope When warned that abject submission offered the only salvation against overwhelming power , hope showed the way to victory . Hope has become the secret weapon of the forces of liberation Aggressors could not dominate the human mind . As long as hope remains , the spirit of man will never be crushed . But hope alone was not and is not sufficient to avert war . We must not only have hope but we must have faith enough to work with other peace loving nations to maintain the peace . Hope was not enough to beat back the aggressors as long as the peace loving nations were unwilling to come to each other s defense . The aggressors were beaten back only when the peace loving nations united to defend themselves . If wars in the future are to be prevented the nations must be united in their determination to keep the peace under law . Nothing is more essential to the future peace of the world than continued cooperation of the nations which had to muster the force necessary to defeat the conspiracy of the Axis powers to dominate the world . While these great states have a special responsibility to enforce the peace , their responsibility is based upon the obligations resting upon all states , large and small , not to use force in international relations except in the defense of law . The responsibility of the great states is to serve and not to dominate the world . To build a foundation of enduring peace we must not only work in harmony with our friends abroad , but we must have the united support of our own people . Even the most experienced pilot cannot bring a ship safely into harbor , unless he has the full cooperation of the crew . For the benefit of all , every individual must do his duty . I appeal to every American , regardless of party , race , creed , or color , to support our efforts to build a strong and lasting United Nations Organization . You , the Members of the Congress , surely know how I feel . Only with your help can I hope to complete one of the greatest tasks ever assigned to a public servant . With Divine guidance , and your help , we will find the new passage to a far better world , a kindly and friendly world , with just and lasting peace . With confidence , I am depending upon all of you . To destroy greedy tyrants with dreams of world domination , we cannot continue in successive generations to sacrifice our finest youth . In the name of human decency and civilization , a more rational method of deciding national differences must and will be found America must assist suffering humanity back along the path of peaceful progress . This will require time and tolerance . We shall need also an abiding faith in the people , the kind of faith and courage which Franklin Delano Roosevelt always had Today , America has become one of the most powerful forces for good on earth . We must keep it so . We have achieved a world leadership which does not depend solely upon our military and naval might . We have learned to fight with other nations in common defense of our freedom . We must now learn to live with other nations for our mutual good . We must learn to trade more with other nations so that there may be for our mutual advantage increased production , increased employment and better standards of living throughout the world . May we Americans all live up to our glorious heritage . In that way , America may well lead the world to peace and prosperity . At this moment , I have in my heart a prayer . As I have assumed my heavy duties , I humbly pray Almighty God , in the words of King Solomon Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people , that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people I ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my Lord and my people .<speech_sep>Sixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima , an important Japanese Army base . That bomb had more power than 20 , 000 tons of N . It had more than two thousand times the blast power of the British Grand Slam which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare . The Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor . They have been repaid many fold . And the end is not yet . With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces . In their present form these bombs are now in production and even more powerful forms are in development . It is an atomic bomb . It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe . The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East . Before 1939 , it was the accepted belief of scientists that it was theoretically possible to release atomic energy . But no one knew any practical method of doing it . By 1942 , however , we knew that the Germans were working feverishly to find a way to add atomic energy to the other engines of war with which they hoped to enslave the world . But they failed . We may be grateful to Providence that the Germans got the V 1 s and V 2 s late and in limited quantities and even more grateful that they did not get the atomic bomb at all . The battle of the laboratories held fateful risks for us as well as the battles of the air , land and sea , and we have now won the battle of the laboratories as we have won the other battles . Beginning in 1940 , before Pearl Harbor , scientific knowledge useful in war was pooled between the United States and Great Britain , and many priceless helps to our victories have come from that arrangement . Under that general policy the research on the atomic bomb was begun . With American and British scientists working together we entered the race of discovery against the Germans . The United States had available the large number of scientists of distinction in the many needed areas of knowledge . It had the tremendous industrial and financial resources necessary for the project and they could be devoted to it without undue impairment of other vital war work . In the United States the laboratory work and the production plants , on which a substantial start had already been made , would be out of reach of enemy bombing , while at that time Britain was exposed to constant air attack and was still threatened with the possibility of invasion . For these reasons Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt agreed that it was wise to carry on the project here . We now have two great plants and many lesser works devoted to the production of atomic power . Employment during peak construction numbered 125 , 000 and over 65 , 000 individuals are even now engaged in operating the plants . Many have worked there for two and a half years . Few know what they have been producing . They see great quantities of material going in and they see nothing coming out of these plants , for the physical size of the explosive charge is exceedingly small . We have spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history and won . But the greatest marvel is not the size of the enterprise , its secrecy , nor its cost , but the achievement of scientific brains in putting together infinitely complex pieces of knowledge held by many men in different fields of science into a workable plan . And hardly less marvelous has been the capacity of industry to design , and of labor to operate , the machines and methods to do things never done before so that the brain child of many minds came forth in physical shape and performed as it was supposed to do . Both science and industry worked under the direction of the United States Army , which achieved a unique success in managing so diverse a problem in the advancement of knowledge in an amazingly short time . It is doubtful if such another combination could be got together in the world . What has been done is the greatest achievement of organized science in history . It was done under high pressure and without failure . We are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city . We shall destroy their docks , their factories , and their communications . Let there be no mistake we shall completely destroy Japan s power to make war . It was to spare the Japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam . Their leaders promptly rejected that ultimatum . If they do not now accept our terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air , the like of which has never been seen on this earth . Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware . The Secretary of War , who has kept in personal touch with all phases of the project , will immediately make public a statement giving further details . His statement will give facts concerning the sites at Oak Ridge near Knoxville , Tennessee , and at Richland near Pasco , Washington , and an installation near Santa Fe , New Mexico . Although the workers at the sites have been making materials to be used in producing the greatest destructive force in history they have not themselves been in danger beyond that of many other occupations , for the utmost care has been taken of their safety . The fact that we can release atomic energy ushers in a new era in man s understanding of nature s forces . Atomic energy may in the future supplement the power that now comes from coal , oil , and falling water , but at present it cannot be produced on a basis to compete with them commercially . Before that comes there must be a long period of intensive research . It has never been the habit of the scientists of this country or the policy of this Government to withhold from the world scientific knowledge . Normally , therefore , everything about the work with atomic energy would be made public . But under present circumstances it is not intended to divulge the technical processes of production or all the military applications , pending further examination of possible methods of protecting us and the rest of the world from the danger of sudden destruction . I shall recommend that the Congress of the United States consider promptly the establishment of an appropriate commission to control the production and use of atomic power within the United States . I shall give further consideration and make further recommendations to the Congress as to how atomic power can become a powerful and forceful influence towards the maintenance of world peace .<speech_sep>I appreciate that introduction very much , and I think he is a good prophet . I have had a wonderful tour today beginning at Rock Island , Ill . , and they tell me this is the last town in Iowa I will stop at , and I will regret that because at every place I have been the crowds have been just like this , and they have been exceedingly cordial . I feel that Iowa is beginning to wake up to the situation , and on November 2 I will not have to say much more about them voting Democratic . You know , the reason for that is that the Democratic Party gave the farmers the price support program , soil conservation , rural electrification , crop insurance , and other progressive measures of this kind . They have led to the greatest prosperity for the farmer that the farmer has ever had in the history of the world . In 1932 , 123 , 000 farmers in the United States had lost their farms . In 1947 , less than 800 farms were foreclosed . That is the greatest record in history . In 1932 , the farmers were hopelessly in debt . Their indebtedness has been reduced by more than 50 percent and they have 18 billion in assets . Think of that Just think of that Now , there are people in this United States that would like to go back to that condition , when labor was receiving an average of 45 cents an hour and when the farmer was getting 3 cents for hogs and 15 cents for corn and burning the corn because it was not worth the price . Those same people now have made an attempt to do away with the price support program which is responsible for this immense production which we have had in the last 7 years and which has kept millions of people in this world alive . I am asking you just to read history , to use your own judgment , and to decide whether you want to go forward with the Democratic Party or whether you want to turn the clock back to the horse and buggy days with such people that made up that do nothing 80th Congress . That Congress tried its level best to take all the rights away from labor . That Congress tried its level best to put the farmer back to 1932 . That Congress tried its level best to put small business out of business . For what purpose To help the big interests which they represented . Do you know that there were more and bigger lobbies in Washington than at any time in the history of the Congress of the United States Some time a little later on I am going to tell you about those terrible lobbies The Association of Manufacturers and the speculators lobbies and several others that I could name right now and I have got the facts and figures on them . They spent more money lobbying for special privilege in this do nothing 80th Congress than has been spent in Washington in the whole history of the country . Now , why did they do that Because they wanted to take you to town . I will tell you you are going to get taken to town if you do not use your privilege on election day . You stayed at home in 1946 and you got the 80th Congress , and you got just exactly what you deserved . You did not exercise your God given right to control this country . Now you are going to have another chance . If you let that chance slip , you will not have my sympathy . If you do not let that chance slip , you will do me a very great favor , for I will live in the White House another 4 years . It is been a very great pleasure to be in Iowa , and I appreciate it . I have had the privilege of riding with all your public officials today . It is been a very great pleasure to ride with your candidate for Governor , who is a wonderful man , the Democratic candidate for Governor . And I was with Guy Gillette , with whom I served in the Senate , and there never was a better Senator in the Senate than Guy Gillette . I am extremely fond of him , and I hope , for your own welfare and for the welfare of this great State , that you will send Guy Gillette back to the Senate , and that you will elect the Democratic candidate for Governor and all the Democratic Congressmen and public officials you possibly can . I like Democrats no matter what office they are running for . I hope that everything will go well with you . I cannot tell you how I appreciate this wonderful turnout , this wonderful reception . It is been just like this all day long . I have come to the conclusion that the people in Iowa like their President and appreciate what he is trying to do for the common people .<speech_sep>
