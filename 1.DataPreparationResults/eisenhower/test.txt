My friends , before I begin the expression of those thoughts that I deem appropriate to this moment , would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own . And I ask that you bow your heads Almighty God , as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the Executive branch of Government join me in beseeching that Thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng , and their fellow citizens everywhere . Give us , we pray , the power to discern clearly right from wrong , and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby , and by the laws of this land . Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station , race or calling . May cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who , under the concepts of our Constitution , hold to differing political faiths so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and Thy glory . Amen . My fellow citizens , the world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing challenge . We sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history . This fact defines the meaning of this day . We are summoned by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath of service , in the presence of God . We are called as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free . Since this century s beginning , a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the continents of the earth . Masses of Asia have awakened to strike off shackles of the past . Great nations of Europe have fought their bloodiest wars . Thrones have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared . New nations have been born . For our own country , it has been a time of recurring trial . We have grown in power and in responsibility . We have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man s history . Seeking to secure peace in the world , we have had to fight through the forests of the Argonne to the shores of Iwo Jima , and to the cold mountains of Korea . In the swift rush of great events , we find ourselves groping to know the full sense and meaning of these times in which we live . In our quest of understanding , we beseech God s guidance . We summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future . We bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question How far have we come in man s long pilgrimage from darkness toward the light Are we nearing the light a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind Or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us Great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home , concerned as we are with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future , each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by , and often even created by , this question that involves all humankind . This trial comes at a moment when man s power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages . We can turn rivers in their courses , level mountains to the plains . Oceans and land and sky are avenues for our colossal commerce . Disease diminishes and life lengthens . Yet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has made it possible . Nations amass wealth . Labor sweats to create and turns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities . Science seems ready to confer upon us , as its final gift , the power to erase human life from this planet . At such a time in history , we who are free must proclaim anew our faith . This faith is the abiding creed of our fathers . It is our faith in the deathless dignity of man , governed by eternal moral and natural laws . This faith defines our full view of life . It establishes , beyond debate , those gifts of the Creator that are man s inalienable rights , and that make all men equal in His sight . In the light of this equality , we know that the virtues most cherished by free people love of truth , pride of work , devotion to country all are treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most exalted . The men who mine coal and fire furnaces , and balance ledgers , and turn lathes , and pick cotton , and heal the sick and plant corn all serve as proudly and as profitably for America as the statesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws . This faith rules our whole way of life . It decrees that we , the people , elect leaders not to rule but to serve . It asserts that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil . It inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the world . And it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of the tyrant . It is because we , all of us , hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence , upheaval or disorder . Rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents , a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a Divine Providence . The enemies of this faith know no god but force , no devotion but its use . They tutor men in treason . They feed upon the hunger of others . Whatever defies them , they torture , especially the truth . Here , then , is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies . This conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our sons . No principle or treasure that we hold , from the spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital , nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle . Freedom is pitted against slavery lightness against the dark . The faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world . This common bond binds the grower of rice in Burma and the planter of wheat in Iowa , the shepherd in southern Italy and the mountaineer in the Andes . It confers a common dignity upon the French soldier who dies in Indo China , the British soldier killed in Malaya , the American life given in Korea . We know , beyond this , that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need . No free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude . For all our own material might , even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories . Equally , we need for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of distant lands . This basic law of interdependence , so manifest in the commerce of peace , applies with thousand fold intensity in the event of war . So we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free peoples lies in unity their danger , in discord . To produce this unity , to meet the challenge of our time , destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world s leadership . So it is proper that we assure our friends once again that , in the discharge of this responsibility , we Americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism between firmness and truculence between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies . We wish our friends the world over to know this above all we face the threat not with dread and confusion but with confidence and conviction . We feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless prisoners of history . We are free men . We shall remain free , never to be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom , a lack of stanch faith . In pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace , we shall be guided by certain fixed principles . These principles are 1 . Abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us , we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace . For , as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men , so it must be the dedication of their leaders , to save humanity from preying upon itself . In the light of this principle , we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations , so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments . The sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that in their purpose they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all and that in their result they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge . 2 . Realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement , we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security . Americans , indeed , all free men , remember that in the final choice a soldier s pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner s chains . 3 . Knowing that only a United States that is strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world , we view our Nation s strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men everywhere . It is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort , the convenience of himself . 4 . Honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world , we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions . 5 . Assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends of freedom , we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well being . Likewise , we shall count upon them to assume , within the limits of their resources , their full and just burdens in the common defense of freedom . 6 . Recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world s peace , we shall strive to foster everywhere , and to practice ourselves , policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade . For the impoverishment of any single people in the world means danger to the well being of all other peoples . 7 . Appreciating that economic need , military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples , we hope , within the framework of the United Nations , to help strengthen such special bonds the world over . The nature of these ties must vary with the different problems of different areas . In the Western Hemisphere , we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common purpose . In Europe , we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the Western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a reality . Only as free Europe unitedly marshals its strength can it effectively safeguard , even with our help , its spiritual and cultural heritage . 8 . Conceiving the defense of freedom , like freedom itself , to be one and indivisible , we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor . We reject any insinuation that one race or another , one people or another , is in any sense inferior or expendable . 9 . Respecting the United Nations as the living sign of all people s hope for peace , we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force . And in our quest for an honorable peace , we shall neither compromise , nor tire , nor ever cease . By these rules of conduct , we hope to be known to all peoples . By their observance , an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact . This hope this supreme aspiration must rule the way we live . We must be ready to dare all for our country . For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid . We must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose . We must be willing , individually and as a Nation , to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us . A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both . These basic precepts are not lofty abstractions , far removed from matters of daily living . They are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength . Patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry . Moral stamina means more energy and more productivity , on the farm and in the factory . Love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists . And so each citizen plays an indispensable role . The productivity of our heads , our hands and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command , for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace . No person , no home , no community can be beyond the reach of this call . We are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience , to work with industry , to teach with persuasion , to preach with conviction , to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion . For this truth must be clear before us whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America . The peace we seek , then , is nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with others . This signifies more than the stilling of guns , casing the sorrow of war . More than escape from death , it is a way of life . More than a haven for the weary , it is a hope for the brave . This is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial . This is the work that awaits us all , to be done with bravery , with charity , and with prayer to Almighty God . My citizens I thank you .<speech_sep>Madame President , Members of the General Assembly When Secretary General Hammarskjold s invitation to address this General Assembly reached me in Bermuda , I was just beginning a series of conferences with the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of Great Britain and of France . Our subject was some of the problems that beset our world . During the remainder of the Bermuda Conference , I had constantly in mind that ahead of me lay a great honor . That honor is mine today as I stand here , privileged to address the General Assembly of the United Nations . At the same time that I appreciate the distinction of addressing you , I have a sense of exhilaration as I look upon this Assembly . Never before in history has so much hope for so many people been gathered together in a single organization . Your deliberations and decisions during these somber years have already realized part of those hopes . But the great tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead . And in the confident expectation of those accomplishments , I would use the office which , for the time being , I hold , to assure you that the Government of the United States will remain steadfast in its support of this body . This we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom , the courage , and the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations , and happiness and well being for all men . Clearly , it would not be fitting for me to take this occasion to present to you a unilateral American report on Bermuda . Nevertheless , I assure you that in our deliberations on that lovely island we sought to invoke those same great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so clearly etched in your Charter . Neither would it be a measure of this great opportunity merely to recite , however hopefully , pious platitudes . I therefore decided that this occasion warranted my saying to you some of the things that have been on the minds and hearts of my legislative and executive associates and on mine for a great many months thoughts I had originally planned to say primarily to the American people . I know that the American people share my deep belief that if a danger exists in the world , it is a danger shared by all and equally , that if hope exists in the mind of one nation , that hope should be shared by all . Finally , if there is to be advanced any proposal designed to ease even by the smallest measure the tensions of today s world , what more appropriate audience could there be than the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations I feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense is new one which who have spent so much of my life in the military profession , would have preferred never to use . That new language is the language of atomic warfare . The atomic age has moved forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should have some comprehension , at least in comparative terms , of the extent of this development of the utmost significance to every one of us . Clearly , if the peoples of the world are to conduct an intelligent search for peace , they must be armed with the significant facts of today s existence . My recital of atomic danger and power is necessarily stated in United States terms , for these are the only incontrovertible facts that I know . I need hardly point out to this Assembly , however , that this subject is global , not merely national in character . On July 16 , 1945 , the United States set off the world s first atomic explosion . Since that date in 1945 , the United States of America has conducted 42 test explosions . Atomic bombs today are more than 25 times as powerful as the weapons with which the atomic age dawned , while hydrogen weapons are in the ranges of millions of tons of TNT equivalent . Today , the United States stockpile of atomic weapons , which , of course , increases daily , exceeds by many times the explosive equivalent of the total of all bombs and all shells that came from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all of the years of World War II . A single air group , whether afloat or land based , can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo exceeding in power all the bombs that fell on Britain in all of World War II . In size and variety , the development of atomic weapons has been no less remarkable . The development has been such that atomic weapons have virtually achieved conventional status within our armed services . In the United States , the Army , the Navy , the Air Force , and the Marine Corps are all capable of putting this weapon to military use . But the dread secret , and the fearful engines of atomic might , are not ours alone . In the first place , the secret is possessed by our friends and allies , Great Britain and Canada , whose scientific genius made a tremendous contribution to our original discoveries , and the designs of atomic bombs . The secret is also known by the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union has informed us that , over recent years , it has devoted extensive resources to atomic weapons . During this period , the Soviet Union has exploded a series of atomic devices , including at least one involving thermo nuclear reactions . If at one time the United States possessed what might have been called a monopoly of atomic power , that monopoly ceased to exist several years ago . Therefore , although our earlier start has permitted us to accumulate what is today a great quantitative advantage , the atomic realities of today comprehend two facts of even greater significance . First , the knowledge now possessed by several nations will eventually be shared by others possibly all others . Second , even a vast superiority in numbers of weapons , and a consequent capability of devastating retaliation , is no preventive , of itself , against the fearful material damage and toll of human lives that would be inflicted by surprise aggression . The free world , at least dimly aware of these facts , has naturally embarked on a large program of warning and defense systems . That program will be accelerated and expanded . But let no one think that the expenditure of vast sums for weapons and systems of defense can guarantee absolute safety for the cities and citizens of any nation . The awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb does not permit of any such easy solution . Even against the most powerful defense , an aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs for a surprise attack could probably place a sufficient number of his bombs on the chosen targets to cause hideous damage . Should such an atomic attack be launched against the United States , our reactions would be swift and resolute . But for me to say that the defense capabilities of the United States are such that they could inflict terrible losses upon an aggressor for me to say that the retaliation capabilities of the United States are so great that such an aggressor s land would be laid waste all this , while fact , is not the true expression of the purpose and the hope of the United States . To pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that two atomic colossi are doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world . To stop there would be to accept helplessly the probability of civilization destroyed the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind handed down to us generation from generation and the condemnation of mankind to begin all over again the age old struggle upward from savagery toward decency , and right , and justice . Surely no sane member of the human race could discover victory in such desolation . Could anyone wish his name to be coupled by history with such human degradation and destruction . Occasional pages of history do record the faces of the Great Destroyers but the whole book of history reveals mankind s never ending quest for peace , and mankind s God given capacity to build . It is with the book of history , and not with isolated pages , that the United States will ever wish to be identified . My country wants to be constructive , not destructive . It wants agreements , not wars , among nations . It wants itself to live in freedom , and in the confidence that the people of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life . So my country s purpose is to help us move out of the dark chamber of horrors into the light , to find a way by which the minds of men , the hopes of men , the souls of men everywhere , can move forward toward peace and happiness and well being . In this quest , I know that we must not lack patience . I know that in a world divided , such as ours today , salvation cannot be attained by one dramatic act . I know that many steps will have to be taken over many months before the world can look at itself one day and truly realize that a new climate of mutually peaceful confidence is abroad in the world . But I know , above all else , that we must start to take these steps now . The United States and its allies , Great Britain and France , have over the past months tried to take some of these steps . Let no one say that we shun the conference table . On the record has long stood the request of the United States , Great Britain , and France to negotiate with the Soviet Union the problems of a divided Germany . On that record has long stood the request of the same three nations to negotiate an Austrian Peace Treaty . On the same record still stands the request of the United Nations to negotiate the problems of Korea . Most recently , we have received from the Soviet Union what is in effect an expression of willingness to hold a Four Power Meeting . Along with our allies , Great Britain and France , we were pleased to see that this note did not contain the unacceptable preconditions previously put forward . As you already know from our joint Bermuda communique , the United States , Great Britain , and France have agreed promptly to meet with the Soviet Union . The Government of the United States approaches this conference with hopeful sincerity . We will bend every effort of our minds to the single purpose of emerging from that conference with tangible results toward peace the only true way of lessening international tension . We never have , we never will , propose or suggest that the Soviet Union surrender what is rightfully theirs . We will never say that the peoples of Russia are an enemy with whom we have no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship . On the contrary , we hope that this coming Conference may initiate a relationship with the Soviet Union which will eventually bring about a free intermingling of the peoples of the East and of the West the one sure , human way of developing the understanding required for confident and peaceful relations . Instead of the discontent which is now settling upon Eastern Germany , occupied Austria , and the countries of Eastern Europe , we seek a harmonious family of free European nations , with none a threat to the other , and least of all a threat to the peoples of Russia . Beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of Asia , we seek peaceful opportunity for these peoples to develop their natural resources and to elevate their lives . These are not idle words or shallow visions . Behind them lies a story of nations lately come to independence , not as a result of war , but through free grant or peaceful negotiation . There is a record , already written , of assistance gladly given by nations of the West to needy peoples , and to those suffering the temporary effects of famine , drought , and natural disaster . These are deeds of peace . They speak more loudly than promises or protestations of peaceful intent . But I do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposals or the restatement of past deeds . The gravity of the time is such that every new avenue of peace , no matter how dimly discernible , should be explored . There is at least one new avenue of peace which has not yet been well explored an avenue now laid out by the General Assembly of the United Nations . In its resolution of November 18th , 1953 , this General Assembly suggested and I quote that the Disarmament Commission study the desirability of establishing a sub committee consisting of representatives of the Powers principally involved , which should seek in private an acceptable solution . . . and report on such a solution to the General Assembly and to the Security Council not later than 1 September 1954 . The United States , heeding the suggestion of the General Assembly of the United Nations , is instantly prepared to meet privately with such other countries as may be principally involved , to seek an acceptable solution to the atomic armaments race which overshadows not only the peace , but the very life , of the world . We shall carry into these private or diplomatic talks a new conception . The United States would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic materials for military purposes . It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers . It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace . The United States knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military buildup can be reversed , this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a great boon , for the benefit of all mankind . The United States knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future . That capability , already proved , is here now today . Who can doubt , if the entire body of the world s scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable material with which to test and develop their ideas , that this capability would rapidly be transformed into universal , efficient , and economic usage . To hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the minds of people , and the governments of the East and West , there are certain steps that can be taken now . I therefore make the following proposals The Governments principally involved , to the extent permitted by elementary prudence , to begin now and continue to make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an International Atomic Energy Agency . We would expect that such an agency would be set up under the aegis of the United Nations . The ratios of contributions , the procedures and other details would properly be within the scope of the private conversations I have referred to earlier . The United States is prepared to undertake these explorations in good faith . Any partner of the United States acting in the same good faith will find the United States a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate . Undoubtedly initial and early contributions to this plan would be small in quantity . However , the proposal has the great virtue that it can be undertaken without the irritations and mutual suspicions incident to any attempt to set up a completely acceptable system of world wide inspection and control . The Atomic Energy Agency could be made responsible for the impounding , storage , and protection of the contributed fissionable and other materials . The ingenuity of our scientists will provide special safe conditions under which such a bank of fissionable material can be made essentially immune to surprise seizure . The more important responsibility of this Atomic Energy Agency would be to devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind . Experts would be mobilized to apply atomic energy to the needs of agriculture , medicine , and other peaceful activities . A special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power starved areas of the world . Thus the contributing powers would be dedicating some of their strength to serve the needs rather than the fears of mankind . The United States would be more than willing it would be proud to take up with others principally involved the development of plans whereby such peaceful use of atomic energy would be expedited . Of those principally involved the Soviet Union must , of course , be one . I would be prepared to submit to the Congress of the United States , and with every expectation of approval , any such plan that would First encourage world wide investigation into the most effective peacetime uses of fissionable material , and with the certainty that they had all the material needed for the conduct of all experiments that were appropriate Second begin to diminish the potential destructive power of the world s atomic stockpiles Third allow all peoples of all nations to see that , in this enlightened age , the great powers of the earth , both of the East and of the West , are interested in human aspirations first , rather than in building up the armaments of war Fourth open up a new channel for peaceful discussion , and initiate at least a new approach to the many difficult problems that must be solved in both private and public conversations , if the world is to shake off the inertia imposed by fear , and is to make positive progress toward peace . Against the dark background of the atomic bomb , the United States does not wish merely to present strength , but also the desire and the hope for peace . The coming months will be fraught with fateful decisions . In this Assembly in the capitals and military headquarters of the world in the hearts of men everywhere , be they governors or governed , may they be the decisions which will lead this world out of fear and into peace . To the making of these fateful decisions , the United States pledges before you and therefore before the world its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death , but consecrated to his life . I again thank the delegates for the great honor they have done me , in inviting me to appear before them , and in listening to me so courteously . Thank you .<speech_sep>
